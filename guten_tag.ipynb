I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure\\nmy dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success\\nof my undertaking.\\n\\nI am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of\\nPetersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which\\nbraces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this\\nfeeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards\\nwhich I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.\\nInspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent\\nand vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of\\nfrost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the\\nregion of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever\\nvisible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a\\nperpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put\\nsome trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished;\\nand, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in\\nwonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable\\nglobe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the\\nphenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered\\nsolitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I\\nmay there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may\\nregulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this\\nvoyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I\\nshall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world\\nnever before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by\\nthe foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to\\nconquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this\\nlaborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little\\nboat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his\\nnative river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you\\ncannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all\\nmankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole\\nto those countries, to reach which at present so many months are\\nrequisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at\\nall possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.\\n\\nThese reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my\\nletter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me\\nto heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as\\na steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual\\neye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I\\nhave read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have\\nbeen made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean\\nthrough the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a\\nhistory of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the\\nwhole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected,\\nyet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study\\nday and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which\\nI had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction\\nhad forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.\\n\\nThese visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets\\nwhose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also\\nbecame a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;\\nI imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the\\nnames of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well\\nacquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.\\nBut just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my\\nthoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.\\n\\nSix years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I\\ncan, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this\\ngreat enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I\\naccompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;\\nI voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often\\nworked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my\\nnights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those\\nbranches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive\\nthe greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an\\nunder-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I\\nmust own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second\\ndignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest\\nearnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.\\n\\nAnd now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?\\nMy life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to\\nevery enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging\\nvoice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is\\nfirm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am\\nabout to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which\\nwill demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits\\nof others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.\\n\\nThis is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly\\nquickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in\\nmy opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The\\ncold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have\\nalready adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the\\ndeck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise\\nprevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no\\nambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and\\nArchangel.\\n\\nI shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my\\nintention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the\\ninsurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary\\namong those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to\\nsail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how\\ncan I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,\\nwill pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon,\\nor never.\\n\\nFarewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you,\\nand save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your\\nlove and kindness.\\n\\nYour affectionate brother,\\n\\nR. Walton\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLetter 2\\n\\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\\n\\nArchangel, 28th March, 17—.\\n\\n\\nHow slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!\\nYet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a\\nvessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have\\nalready engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly\\npossessed of dauntless courage.\\n\\nBut I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the\\nabsence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no\\nfriend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there\\nwill be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no\\none will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts\\nto paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of\\nfeeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose\\neyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I\\nbitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet\\ncourageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose\\ntastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a\\nfriend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution\\nand too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me\\nthat I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild\\non a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages.\\nAt that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own\\ncountry; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its\\nmost important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the\\nnecessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native\\ncountry. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many\\nschoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my\\ndaydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters\\ncall it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense\\nenough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to\\nendeavour to regulate my mind.\\n\\nWell, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the\\nwide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet\\nsome feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these\\nrugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage\\nand enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase\\nmore characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an\\nEnglishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,\\nunsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of\\nhumanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;\\nfinding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist\\nin my enterprise.\\n\\nThe master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the\\nship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This\\ncircumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made\\nme very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years\\nspent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the\\ngroundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to\\nthe usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be\\nnecessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness\\nof heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt\\nmyself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard\\nof him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the\\nhappiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved\\na young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable\\nsum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw\\nhis mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in\\ntears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,\\nconfessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,\\nand that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend\\nreassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,\\ninstantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his\\nmoney, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he\\nbestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his\\nprize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young\\nwoman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old\\nman decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,\\nwhen he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned\\nuntil he heard that his former mistress was married according to her\\ninclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is\\nso; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind\\nof ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct\\nthe more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which\\notherwise he would command.\\n\\nYet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can\\nconceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am\\nwavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage\\nis only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The\\nwinter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it\\nis considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail\\nsooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me\\nsufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the\\nsafety of others is committed to my care.\\n\\nI cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my\\nundertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of\\nthe trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which\\nI am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to “the\\nland of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not\\nbe alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and\\nwoeful as the “Ancient Mariner.” You will smile at my allusion, but I\\nwill disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my\\npassionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that\\nproduction of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something\\nat work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically\\nindustrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and\\nlabour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief\\nin the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out\\nof the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited\\nregions I am about to explore.\\n\\nBut to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after\\nhaving traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of\\nAfrica or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to\\nlook on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to\\nme by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when\\nI need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. \\nRemember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.\\n\\nYour affectionate brother,\\n Robert Walton\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLetter 3\\n\\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\\n\\nJuly 7th, 17—.\\n\\n\\nMy dear Sister,\\n\\nI write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe—and well advanced\\non my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on\\nits homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not\\nsee my native land, perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good\\nspirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the\\nfloating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers\\nof the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We\\nhave already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of\\nsummer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales,\\nwhich blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire\\nto attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not\\nexpected.\\n\\nNo incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a\\nletter. One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are\\naccidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and\\nI shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.\\n\\nAdieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured that for my own sake, as well as\\nyours, I will not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool,\\npersevering, and prudent.\\n\\nBut success _shall_ crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I\\nhave gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars\\nthemselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why not\\nstill proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? What can stop the\\ndetermined heart and resolved will of man?\\n\\nMy swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I must\\nfinish. Heaven bless my beloved sister!\\n\\nR.W.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLetter 4\\n\\n\\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\\n\\nAugust 5th, 17—.\\n\\nSo strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear\\nrecording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before\\nthese papers can come into your possession.\\n\\nLast Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed\\nin the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which\\nshe floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we\\nwere compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to,\\nhoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.\\n\\nAbout two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out\\nin every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to\\nhave no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to\\ngrow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly\\nattracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own\\nsituation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by\\ndogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a\\nbeing which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,\\nsat in the sledge and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress\\nof the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the\\ndistant inequalities of the ice.\\n\\nThis appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed,\\nmany hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that\\nit was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by\\nice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the\\ngreatest attention.\\n\\nAbout two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before\\nnight the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the\\nmorning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which\\nfloat about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to\\nrest for a few hours.\\n\\nIn the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and\\nfound all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently\\ntalking to someone in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we\\nhad seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large\\nfragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human\\nbeing within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.\\nHe was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of\\nsome undiscovered island, but a European. When I appeared on deck the\\nmaster said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish\\non the open sea.”\\n\\nOn perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a\\nforeign accent. “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he,\\n“will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”\\n\\nYou may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed\\nto me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have\\nsupposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not\\nhave exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I\\nreplied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the\\nnorthern pole.\\n\\nUpon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.\\nGood God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for\\nhis safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were\\nnearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and\\nsuffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted\\nto carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh\\nair he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the deck and\\nrestored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to\\nswallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we\\nwrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the\\nkitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,\\nwhich restored him wonderfully.\\n\\nTwo days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often\\nfeared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he\\nhad in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and\\nattended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more\\ninteresting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of\\nwildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone\\nperforms an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most\\ntrifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with\\na beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he\\nis generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his\\nteeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.\\n\\nWhen my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off\\nthe men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not\\nallow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body\\nand mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.\\nOnce, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice\\nin so strange a vehicle.\\n\\nHis countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and\\nhe replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”\\n\\n“And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we\\nsaw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”\\n\\nThis aroused the stranger’s attention, and he asked a multitude of\\nquestions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had\\npursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “I have,\\ndoubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good\\npeople; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”\\n\\n“Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to\\ntrouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.”\\n\\n“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have\\nbenevolently restored me to life.”\\n\\nSoon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the\\nice had destroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answer\\nwith any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near\\nmidnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety\\nbefore that time; but of this I could not judge.\\n\\nFrom this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the\\nstranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for\\nthe sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in\\nthe cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.\\nI have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant\\nnotice if any new object should appear in sight.\\n\\nSuch is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the\\npresent day. The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very\\nsilent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.\\nYet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all\\ninterested in him, although they have had very little communication\\nwith him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his\\nconstant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must\\nhave been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck\\nso attractive and amiable.\\n\\nI said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend\\non the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been\\nbroken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother\\nof my heart.\\n\\nI shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals,\\nshould I have any fresh incidents to record.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAugust 13th, 17—.\\n\\n\\nMy affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my\\nadmiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so\\nnoble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant\\ngrief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and\\nwhen he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,\\nyet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.\\n\\nHe is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck,\\napparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although\\nunhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he\\ninterests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently\\nconversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without\\ndisguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my\\neventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken\\nto secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the\\nlanguage of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul\\nand to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would\\nsacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my\\nenterprise. One man’s life or death were but a small price to pay for\\nthe acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should\\nacquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a\\ndark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance. At first I\\nperceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before\\nhis eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle\\nfast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I\\npaused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: “Unhappy man! Do you\\nshare my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me;\\nlet me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!”\\n\\nSuch words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the\\nparoxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened\\npowers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were\\nnecessary to restore his composure.\\n\\nHaving conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise\\nhimself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of\\ndespair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked\\nme the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it\\nawakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a\\nfriend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than\\nhad ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could\\nboast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.\\n\\n“I agree with you,” replied the stranger; “we are\\nunfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than\\nourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to\\nperfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most\\nnoble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting\\nfriendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for\\ndespair. But I—I have lost everything and cannot begin life\\nanew.”\\n\\nAs he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled\\ngrief that touched me to the heart. But he was silent and presently\\nretired to his cabin.\\n\\nEven broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he\\ndoes the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight\\nafforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of\\nelevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he\\nmay suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he\\nhas retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a\\nhalo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.\\n\\nWill you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine\\nwanderer? You would not if you saw him. You have been tutored and\\nrefined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore\\nsomewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to\\nappreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes I\\nhave endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that\\nelevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew. I\\nbelieve it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing\\npower of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled\\nfor clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a\\nvoice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAugust 19th, 17—.\\n\\n\\nYesterday the stranger said to me, “You may easily perceive, Captain\\nWalton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had\\ndetermined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with\\nme, but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for\\nknowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the\\ngratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine\\nhas been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be\\nuseful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same\\ncourse, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me\\nwhat I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one\\nthat may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you\\nin case of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually\\ndeemed marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might\\nfear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things\\nwill appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would\\nprovoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers\\nof nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series\\ninternal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.”\\n\\nYou may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered\\ncommunication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by\\na recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear\\nthe promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong\\ndesire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power. I expressed\\nthese feelings in my answer.\\n\\n“I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is\\nuseless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I\\nshall repose in peace. I understand your feeling,” continued he,\\nperceiving that I wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my\\nfriend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my\\ndestiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is\\ndetermined.”\\n\\nHe then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I\\nshould be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have\\nresolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to\\nrecord, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during\\nthe day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This\\nmanuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who\\nknow him, and who hear it from his own lips—with what interest and\\nsympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence my\\ntask, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me\\nwith all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in\\nanimation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul\\nwithin. Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which\\nembraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it—thus!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 1\\n\\n\\nI am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most\\ndistinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years\\ncounsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public\\nsituations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who\\nknew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public\\nbusiness. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the\\naffairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his\\nmarrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a\\nhusband and the father of a family.\\n\\nAs the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot\\nrefrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a\\nmerchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous\\nmischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a\\nproud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty\\nand oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been\\ndistinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,\\ntherefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his\\ndaughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in\\nwretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and\\nwas deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.\\nHe bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct\\nso little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in\\nendeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin\\nthe world again through his credit and assistance.\\n\\nBeaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten\\nmonths before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery,\\nhe hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the\\nReuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort\\nhad saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but\\nit was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in\\nthe meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a\\nmerchant’s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;\\nhis grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for\\nreflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end\\nof three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.\\n\\nHis daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw\\nwith despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that\\nthere was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort\\npossessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support\\nher in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw and\\nby various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to\\nsupport life.\\n\\nSeveral months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time\\nwas more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence\\ndecreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving\\nher an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt\\nby Beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the\\nchamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who\\ncommitted herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he\\nconducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a\\nrelation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.\\n\\nThere was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but\\nthis circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted\\naffection. There was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind\\nwhich rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love\\nstrongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the\\nlate-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set\\na greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and\\nworship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the\\ndoting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her\\nvirtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing\\nher for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace\\nto his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes\\nand her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is\\nsheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her\\nwith all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and\\nbenevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto\\nconstant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During\\nthe two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had\\ngradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after\\ntheir union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change\\nof scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,\\nas a restorative for her weakened frame.\\n\\nFrom Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born\\nat Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained\\nfor several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each\\nother, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very\\nmine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother’s tender caresses and\\nmy father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my\\nfirst recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something\\nbetter—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on\\nthem by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in\\ntheir hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled\\ntheir duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed\\ntowards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit\\nof tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during\\nevery hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity,\\nand of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but\\none train of enjoyment to me.\\n\\nFor a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a\\ndaughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five\\nyears old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they\\npassed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent\\ndisposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my\\nmother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a\\npassion—remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been\\nrelieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the\\nafflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale\\nattracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number\\nof half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst\\nshape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,\\naccompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife,\\nhard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to\\nfive hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother far\\nabove all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were\\ndark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her\\nhair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her\\nclothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was\\nclear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of\\nher face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold\\nher without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent,\\nand bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.\\n\\nThe peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and\\nadmiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was\\nnot her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a\\nGerman and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with\\nthese good people to nurse: they were better off then. They had not been\\nlong married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of their\\ncharge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory\\nof Italy—one among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exerted\\nhimself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its\\nweakness. Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria\\nwas not known. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and\\na beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude\\nabode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.\\n\\nWhen my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of\\nour villa a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed\\nto shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter\\nthan the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his\\npermission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their\\ncharge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed\\na blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty\\nand want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They\\nconsulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza\\nbecame the inmate of my parents’ house—my more than\\nsister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and\\nmy pleasures.\\n\\nEveryone loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential\\nattachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my\\npride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought to\\nmy home, my mother had said playfully, “I have a pretty present for my\\nVictor—tomorrow he shall have it.” And when, on the morrow, she\\npresented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish\\nseriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth\\nas mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on\\nher I received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other\\nfamiliarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body\\nforth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than\\nsister, since till death she was to be mine only.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 2\\n\\n\\nWe were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in\\nour ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of\\ndisunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and\\nthe diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us\\nnearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated\\ndisposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense\\napplication and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.\\nShe busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;\\nand in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss\\nhome —the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons,\\ntempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of\\nour Alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight.\\nWhile my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the\\nmagnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their\\ncauses. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.\\nCuriosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,\\ngladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the\\nearliest sensations I can remember.\\n\\nOn the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave\\nup entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native\\ncountry. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive,\\nthe eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a\\nleague from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the\\nlives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my\\ntemper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was\\nindifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united\\nmyself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry\\nClerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular\\ntalent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for\\nits own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He\\ncomposed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and\\nknightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into\\nmasquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of\\nRoncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous\\ntrain who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands\\nof the infidels.\\n\\nNo human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My\\nparents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.\\nWe felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to\\ntheir caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights\\nwhich we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families I distinctly\\ndiscerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted\\nthe development of filial love.\\n\\nMy temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some\\nlaw in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits\\nbut to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things\\nindiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages,\\nnor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states\\npossessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth\\nthat I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of\\nthings or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man\\nthat occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical,\\nor in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.\\n\\nMeanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral\\nrelations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,\\nand the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was\\nto become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the\\ngallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul\\nof Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.\\nHer sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of\\nher celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was\\nthe living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become\\nsullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that\\nshe was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And\\nClerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval? Yet\\nhe might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his\\ngenerosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for\\nadventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of\\nbeneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring\\nambition.\\n\\nI feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood,\\nbefore misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of\\nextensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides,\\nin drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which\\nled, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would\\naccount to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my\\ndestiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost\\nforgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent\\nwhich, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.\\n\\nNatural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,\\ntherefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my\\npredilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age we all went\\non a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the\\nweather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I\\nchanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it\\nwith apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful\\nfacts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new\\nlight seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my\\ndiscovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at the title page of my\\nbook and said, “Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste\\nyour time upon this; it is sad trash.”\\n\\nIf, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me\\nthat the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern\\nsystem of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers\\nthan the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while\\nthose of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I\\nshould certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my\\nimagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my\\nformer studies. It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never\\nhave received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. But the cursory glance\\nmy father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was\\nacquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest\\navidity.\\n\\nWhen I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this\\nauthor, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and\\nstudied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me\\ntreasures known to few besides myself. I have described myself as always\\nhaving been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of\\nnature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern\\nphilosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.\\nSir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking\\nup shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his\\nsuccessors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted\\nappeared even to my boy’s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same\\npursuit.\\n\\nThe untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted\\nwith their practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little\\nmore. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal\\nlineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect,\\nanatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes\\nin their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. I\\nhad gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep\\nhuman beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and\\nignorantly I had repined.\\n\\nBut here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew\\nmore. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their\\ndisciple. It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth\\ncentury; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of\\nGeneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite\\nstudies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a\\nchild’s blindness, added to a student’s thirst for knowledge.\\nUnder the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest\\ndiligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the elixir\\nof life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was an\\ninferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could\\nbanish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but\\na violent death!\\n\\nNor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a\\npromise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which\\nI most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I\\nattributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a\\nwant of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was\\noccupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand\\ncontradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of\\nmultifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish\\nreasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.\\n\\nWhen I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near\\nBelrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. It\\nadvanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once\\nwith frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained,\\nwhile the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.\\nAs I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an\\nold and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so\\nsoon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing\\nremained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning, we found\\nthe tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the\\nshock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. I never beheld\\nanything so utterly destroyed.\\n\\nBefore this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of\\nelectricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural\\nphilosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on\\nthe explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of\\nelectricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.\\nAll that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa,\\nAlbertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by\\nsome fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my\\naccustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever\\nbe known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew\\ndespicable. By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps\\nmost subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former\\noccupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed\\nand abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a\\nwould-be science which could never even step within the threshold of\\nreal knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to the\\nmathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as\\nbeing built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.\\n\\nThus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments\\nare we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me\\nas if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the\\nimmediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life—the last effort\\nmade by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even\\nthen hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me. Her victory was\\nannounced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which\\nfollowed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting\\nstudies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with\\ntheir prosecution, happiness with their disregard.\\n\\nIt was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.\\nDestiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and\\nterrible destruction.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3\\n\\n\\nWhen I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I\\nshould become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had\\nhitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it\\nnecessary for the completion of my education that I should be made\\nacquainted with other customs than those of my native country. My\\ndeparture was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day\\nresolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life\\noccurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery.\\n\\nElizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was\\nin the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged to\\npersuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first\\nyielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her\\nfavourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She\\nattended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity\\nof the distemper—Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this\\nimprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother\\nsickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the\\nlooks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her\\ndeathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert\\nher. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. “My\\nchildren,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness were\\nplaced on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the\\nconsolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to\\nmy younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy\\nand beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But these are\\nnot thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to\\ndeath and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.”\\n\\nShe died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.\\nI need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent\\nby that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the\\nsoul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so\\nlong before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day\\nand whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed\\nfor ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been\\nextinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear\\ncan be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of\\nthe first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the\\nevil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has\\nnot that rude hand rent away some dear connection? And why should I\\ndescribe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at\\nlength arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and\\nthe smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a\\nsacrilege, is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had still\\nduties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the\\nrest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the\\nspoiler has not seized.\\n\\nMy departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events,\\nwas now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of\\nsome weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose,\\nakin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of\\nlife. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I was\\nunwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above\\nall, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.\\n\\nShe indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.\\nShe looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and\\nzeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call\\nher uncle and cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time,\\nwhen she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.\\nShe forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.\\n\\nThe day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last\\nevening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit\\nhim to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain. His\\nfather was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the\\naspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune\\nof being debarred from a liberal education. He said little, but when\\nhe spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a\\nrestrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details\\nof commerce.\\n\\nWe sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor\\npersuade ourselves to say the word “Farewell!” It was said, and we\\nretired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the\\nother was deceived; but when at morning’s dawn I descended to the\\ncarriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my father\\nagain to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to\\nrenew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last\\nfeminine attentions on her playmate and friend.\\n\\nI threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in\\nthe most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by\\namiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual\\npleasure—I was now alone. In the university whither I was going I\\nmust form my own friends and be my own protector. My life had hitherto\\nbeen remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible\\nrepugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and\\nClerval; these were “old familiar faces,” but I believed myself\\ntotally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as\\nI commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I\\nardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home,\\nthought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had\\nlonged to enter the world and take my station among other human beings. \\nNow my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to\\nrepent.\\n\\nI had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my\\njourney to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the\\nhigh white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted and was\\nconducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.\\n\\nThe next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to\\nsome of the principal professors. Chance—or rather the evil\\ninfluence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me\\nfrom the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father’s\\ndoor—led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He\\nwas an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He\\nasked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches\\nof science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied carelessly, and\\npartly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal\\nauthors I had studied. The professor stared. “Have you,” he\\nsaid, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”\\n\\nI replied in the affirmative. “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with\\nwarmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly\\nand entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems\\nand useless names. Good God! In what desert land have you lived,\\nwhere no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you\\nhave so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they\\nare ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific\\nage, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear\\nsir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”\\n\\nSo saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books\\ntreating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and\\ndismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following\\nweek he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural\\nphilosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow\\nprofessor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he\\nomitted.\\n\\nI returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long\\nconsidered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I\\nreturned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any\\nshape. M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a\\nrepulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in\\nfavour of his pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected a\\nstrain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come\\nto concerning them in my early years. As a child I had not been\\ncontent with the results promised by the modern professors of natural\\nscience. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my\\nextreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the\\nsteps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the\\ndiscoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.\\nBesides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.\\nIt was very different when the masters of the science sought\\nimmortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now\\nthe scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit\\nitself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in\\nscience was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of\\nboundless grandeur for realities of little worth.\\n\\nSuch were my reflections during the first two or three days of my\\nresidence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming\\nacquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new\\nabode. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information\\nwhich M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I\\ncould not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver\\nsentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.\\nWaldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.\\n\\nPartly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing\\nroom, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very\\nunlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an\\naspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his\\ntemples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person\\nwas short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.\\nHe began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and\\nthe various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing\\nwith fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took\\na cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of\\nits elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he\\nconcluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I\\nshall never forget:\\n\\n“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he,\\n“promised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters\\npromise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that\\nthe elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem\\nonly made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or\\ncrucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses\\nof nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the\\nheavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of\\nthe air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers;\\nthey can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even\\nmock the invisible world with its own shadows.”\\n\\nSuch were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of\\nthe fate—enounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soul\\nwere grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were\\ntouched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was\\nsounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,\\none purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of\\nFrankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps\\nalready marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and\\nunfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.\\n\\nI closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of\\ninsurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I\\nhad no power to produce it. By degrees, after the morning’s dawn,\\nsleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream.\\nThere only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to\\ndevote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a\\nnatural talent. On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. His\\nmanners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,\\nfor there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in\\nhis own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I\\ngave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had\\ngiven to his fellow professor. He heard with attention the little\\nnarration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius\\nAgrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had\\nexhibited. He said that “These were men to whose indefatigable zeal\\nmodern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their\\nknowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names\\nand arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a\\ngreat degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The\\nlabours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever\\nfail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.” I\\nlistened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption\\nor affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my\\nprejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured\\nterms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his\\ninstructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have\\nmade me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended\\nlabours. I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to\\nprocure.\\n\\n“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a\\ndisciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of\\nyour success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the\\ngreatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that\\nI have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not\\nneglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry\\nchemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your\\nwish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty\\nexperimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural\\nphilosophy, including mathematics.”\\n\\nHe then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his\\nvarious machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and\\npromising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in\\nthe science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of\\nbooks which I had requested, and I took my leave.\\n\\nThus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 4\\n\\n\\nFrom this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the\\nmost comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.\\nI read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,\\nwhich modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the\\nlectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the\\nuniversity, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense\\nand real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive\\nphysiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In\\nM. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by\\ndogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and\\ngood nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand ways\\nhe smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse\\ninquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was at\\nfirst fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and\\nsoon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the\\nlight of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.\\n\\nAs I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress\\nwas rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and\\nmy proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me,\\nwith a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman\\nexpressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years\\npassed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was\\nengaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I\\nhoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can conceive\\nof the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as\\nothers have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in\\na scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.\\nA mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must\\ninfallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who\\ncontinually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was\\nsolely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two\\nyears I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical\\ninstruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the\\nuniversity. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well\\nacquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as\\ndepended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my\\nresidence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought\\nof returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident\\nhappened that protracted my stay.\\n\\nOne of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was\\nthe structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with\\nlife. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?\\nIt was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a\\nmystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming\\nacquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our\\ninquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined\\nthenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of\\nnatural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been\\nanimated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this\\nstudy would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the\\ncauses of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became\\nacquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I\\nmust also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.\\nIn my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my\\nmind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever\\nremember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared\\nthe apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and\\na churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of\\nlife, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become\\nfood for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of\\nthis decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and\\ncharnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most\\ninsupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the\\nfine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of\\ndeath succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm\\ninherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and\\nanalysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change\\nfrom life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this\\ndarkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and\\nwondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity\\nof the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so\\nmany men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same\\nscience, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a\\nsecret.\\n\\nRemember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not\\nmore certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is\\ntrue. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the\\ndiscovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights of\\nincredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of\\ngeneration and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing\\nanimation upon lifeless matter.\\n\\nThe astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery\\nsoon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in\\npainful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the\\nmost gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so\\ngreat and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been\\nprogressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.\\nWhat had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation\\nof the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it\\nall opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a\\nnature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them\\ntowards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already\\naccomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead\\nand found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly\\nineffectual light.\\n\\nI see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes\\nexpress, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with\\nwhich I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end\\nof my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that\\nsubject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,\\nto your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my\\nprecepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of\\nknowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town\\nto be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature\\nwill allow.\\n\\nWhen I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated\\na long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.\\nAlthough I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to\\nprepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of\\nfibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable\\ndifficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the\\ncreation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my\\nimagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to\\ndoubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful\\nas man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared\\nadequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should\\nultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my\\noperations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be\\nimperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes\\nplace in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present\\nattempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor\\ncould I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any\\nargument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I\\nbegan the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts\\nformed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first\\nintention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,\\nabout eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having\\nformed this determination and having spent some months in successfully\\ncollecting and arranging my materials, I began.\\n\\nNo one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like\\na hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death\\nappeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and\\npour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless\\nme as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would\\nowe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his\\nchild so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these\\nreflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless\\nmatter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)\\nrenew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.\\n\\nThese thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking\\nwith unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my\\nperson had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very\\nbrink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the\\nnext day or the next hour might realise. One secret which I alone\\npossessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon\\ngazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless\\neagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive\\nthe horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps\\nof the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless\\nclay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but\\nthen a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed\\nto have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was\\nindeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed\\nacuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had\\nreturned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and\\ndisturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human\\nframe. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,\\nand separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,\\nI kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from\\ntheir sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The\\ndissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;\\nand often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,\\nwhilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I\\nbrought my work near to a conclusion.\\n\\nThe summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in\\none pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields\\nbestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant\\nvintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the\\nsame feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also\\nto forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had\\nnot seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them, and I\\nwell remembered the words of my father: “I know that while you are\\npleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall\\nhear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any\\ninterruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties\\nare equally neglected.”\\n\\nI knew well therefore what would be my father’s feelings, but I could\\nnot tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which\\nhad taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it\\nwere, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection\\nuntil the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature,\\nshould be completed.\\n\\nI then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect\\nto vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was\\njustified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from\\nblame. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and\\npeaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to\\ndisturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge\\nis an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself\\nhas a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for\\nthose simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that\\nstudy is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human\\nmind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit\\nwhatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic\\naffections, Greece had not been enslaved, Cæsar would have spared his\\ncountry, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the\\nempires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.\\n\\nBut I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my\\ntale, and your looks remind me to proceed.\\n\\nMy father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my\\nsilence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.\\nWinter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not\\nwatch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always\\nyielded me supreme delight—so deeply was I engrossed in my\\noccupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near\\nto a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had\\nsucceeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared\\nrather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other\\nunwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.\\nEvery night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most\\npainful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow\\ncreatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at\\nthe wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone\\nsustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and\\namusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself\\nboth of these when my creation should be complete.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5\\n\\n\\nIt was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment\\nof my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I\\ncollected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a\\nspark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was\\nalready one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the\\npanes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the\\nhalf-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature\\nopen; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.\\n\\nHow can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate\\nthe wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to\\nform? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as\\nbeautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered\\nthe work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous\\nblack, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these\\nluxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,\\nthat seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which\\nthey were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.\\n\\nThe different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings\\nof human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole\\npurpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had\\ndeprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour\\nthat far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty\\nof the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my\\nheart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I\\nrushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my\\nbed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude\\nsucceeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the\\nbed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.\\nBut it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest\\ndreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in\\nthe streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her,\\nbut as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with\\nthe hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I\\nheld the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her\\nform, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.\\nI started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my\\nteeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and\\nyellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window\\nshutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had\\ncreated. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they\\nmay be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some\\ninarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have\\nspoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to\\ndetain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the\\ncourtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained\\nduring the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest\\nagitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if\\nit were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I\\nhad so miserably given life.\\n\\nOh! No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy\\nagain endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I\\nhad gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those\\nmuscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing\\nsuch as even Dante could not have conceived.\\n\\nI passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and\\nhardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly\\nsank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with\\nthis horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had\\nbeen my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a\\nhell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!\\n\\nMorning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my\\nsleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple\\nand clock, which indicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates\\nof the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into\\nthe streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the\\nwretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my\\nview. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but\\nfelt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured\\nfrom a black and comfortless sky.\\n\\nI continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by\\nbodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I\\ntraversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or\\nwhat I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I\\nhurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:\\n \\n Like one who, on a lonely road,\\n Doth walk in fear and dread,\\n And, having once turned round, walks on,\\n And turns no more his head;\\n Because he knows a frightful fiend\\n Doth close behind him tread.\\n \\n [Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner.”]\\n\\n\\n\\nContinuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various\\ndiligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why;\\nbut I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming\\ntowards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer I observed\\nthat it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and\\non the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me,\\ninstantly sprung out. “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he,\\n“how glad I am to see you! How fortunate that you should be here at\\nthe very moment of my alighting!”\\n\\nNothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back\\nto my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear\\nto my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror\\nand misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months,\\ncalm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial\\nmanner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for\\nsome time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being\\npermitted to come to Ingolstadt. “You may easily believe,” said\\nhe, “how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all\\nnecessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping;\\nand, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant\\nanswer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch\\nschoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florins\\na year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.’ But his\\naffection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has\\npermitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of\\nknowledge.”\\n\\n“It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left\\nmy father, brothers, and Elizabeth.”\\n\\n“Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from\\nyou so seldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their\\naccount myself. But, my dear Frankenstein,” continued he, stopping\\nshort and gazing full in my face, “I did not before remark how very ill\\nyou appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for\\nseveral nights.”\\n\\n“You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one\\noccupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see;\\nbut I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an\\nend and that I am at length free.”\\n\\nI trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to\\nallude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a\\nquick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and\\nthe thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my\\napartment might still be there, alive and walking about. I dreaded to\\nbehold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.\\nEntreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the\\nstairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was already on the\\nlock of the door before I recollected myself. I then paused, and a\\ncold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly open, as\\nchildren are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in\\nwaiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped\\nfearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed\\nfrom its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good\\nfortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy\\nhad indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.\\n\\nWe ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;\\nbut I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed\\nme; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse\\nbeat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same\\nplace; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.\\nClerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,\\nbut when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes\\nfor which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless\\nlaughter frightened and astonished him.\\n\\n“My dear Victor,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake,\\nis the matter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill you are! What is the\\ncause of all this?”\\n\\n“Do not ask me,” cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I\\nthought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; “_he_ can\\ntell. Oh, save me! Save me!” I imagined that the monster seized me;\\nI struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.\\n\\nPoor Clerval! What must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he\\nanticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I\\nwas not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not\\nrecover my senses for a long, long time.\\n\\nThis was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for\\nseveral months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I\\nafterwards learned that, knowing my father’s advanced age and unfitness\\nfor so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make\\nElizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my\\ndisorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive\\nnurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he\\ndid not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest\\naction that he could towards them.\\n\\nBut I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and\\nunremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.\\nThe form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever\\nbefore my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my\\nwords surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings\\nof my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I\\ncontinually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder\\nindeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.\\n\\nBy very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and\\ngrieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became\\ncapable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I\\nperceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young\\nbuds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was\\na divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my\\nconvalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in\\nmy bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as\\ncheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.\\n\\n“Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very good\\nyou are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you\\npromised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever\\nrepay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I\\nhave been the occasion, but you will forgive me.”\\n\\n“You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get\\nwell as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I\\nmay speak to you on one subject, may I not?”\\n\\nI trembled. One subject! What could it be? Could he allude to an object on\\nwhom I dared not even think?\\n\\n“Compose yourself,” said Clerval, who observed my change of\\ncolour, “I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father\\nand cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your\\nown handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at\\nyour long silence.”\\n\\n“Is that all, my dear Henry? How could you suppose that my first\\nthought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and\\nwho are so deserving of my love?”\\n\\n“If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad\\nto see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from\\nyour cousin, I believe.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6\\n\\n\\nClerval then put the following letter into my hands. It was from my\\nown Elizabeth:\\n\\n“My dearest Cousin,\\n\\n“You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear\\nkind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. You are\\nforbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor,\\nis necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long time I have thought\\nthat each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have\\nrestrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have\\nprevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so\\nlong a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to\\nperform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending on\\nyour sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never\\nguess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of\\nyour poor cousin. Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed\\nyou are getting better. I eagerly hope that you will confirm this\\nintelligence soon in your own handwriting.\\n\\n“Get well—and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home and\\nfriends who love you dearly. Your father’s health is vigorous, and he\\nasks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a\\ncare will ever cloud his benevolent countenance. How pleased you would\\nbe to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now sixteen and full\\nof activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter\\ninto foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his\\nelder brother returns to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of\\na military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your\\npowers of application. He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his\\ntime is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the\\nlake. I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point\\nand permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.\\n\\n“Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken\\nplace since you left us. The blue lake and snow-clad mountains—they\\nnever change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are\\nregulated by the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take up\\nmy time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing\\nnone but happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one\\nchange has taken place in our little household. Do you remember on\\nwhat occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably you do not;\\nI will relate her history, therefore in a few words. Madame Moritz,\\nher mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the\\nthird. This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but\\nthrough a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and\\nafter the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed\\nthis, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother\\nto allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions of our\\ncountry have produced simpler and happier manners than those which\\nprevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less\\ndistinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the\\nlower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are\\nmore refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same\\nthing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in\\nour family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our\\nfortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a\\nsacrifice of the dignity of a human being.\\n\\n“Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I\\nrecollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one\\nglance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that\\nAriosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica—she looked so\\nfrank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,\\nby which she was induced to give her an education superior to that\\nwhich she had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid;\\nJustine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not\\nmean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but\\nyou could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.\\nAlthough her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,\\nyet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She\\nthought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her\\nphraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.\\n\\n“When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own\\ngrief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness\\nwith the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other\\ntrials were reserved for her.\\n\\n“One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the\\nexception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The\\nconscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the\\ndeaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her\\npartiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor\\nconfirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few months\\nafter your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her\\nrepentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quitted our house; she\\nwas much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness\\nand a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable\\nfor vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a nature\\nto restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her\\nrepentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness,\\nbut much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her\\nbrothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz\\ninto a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is\\nnow at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather,\\nat the beginning of this last winter. Justine has just returned to us;\\nand I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle,\\nand extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her\\nexpression continually remind me of my dear aunt.\\n\\n“I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling\\nWilliam. I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with\\nsweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. When he\\nsmiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with\\nhealth. He has already had one or two little _wives,_ but Louisa Biron\\nis his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.\\n\\n“Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little\\ngossip concerning the good people of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield\\nhas already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching\\nmarriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly\\nsister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your\\nfavourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes\\nsince the departure of Clerval from Geneva. But he has already\\nrecovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a\\nlively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and much\\nolder than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with\\neverybody.\\n\\n“I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety\\nreturns upon me as I conclude. Write, dearest Victor,—one line—one\\nword will be a blessing to us. Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his\\nkindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely\\ngrateful. Adieu! my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreat\\nyou, write!\\n\\n“Elizabeth Lavenza.\\n\\n\\n“Geneva, March 18th, 17—.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Dear, dear Elizabeth!” I exclaimed, when I had read her\\nletter: “I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety\\nthey must feel.” I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but\\nmy convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. In another\\nfortnight I was able to leave my chamber.\\n\\nOne of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the\\nseveral professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a\\nkind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had\\nsustained. Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the\\nbeginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even\\nto the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored\\nto health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony\\nof my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my\\napparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he\\nperceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had\\npreviously been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of\\nno avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture\\nwhen he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I\\nhad made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the\\nsubject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to\\nmodesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science\\nitself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What\\ncould I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he\\nhad placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which\\nwere to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I\\nwrithed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.\\nClerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the\\nsensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his\\ntotal ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. I\\nthanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly\\nthat he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from\\nme; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence\\nthat knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in\\nhim that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which\\nI feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.\\n\\nM. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of\\nalmost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even\\nmore pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. “D—n\\nthe fellow!” cried he; “why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has\\noutstript us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A\\nyoungster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly\\nas in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if\\nhe is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.—Ay,\\nay,” continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering,\\n“M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.\\nYoung men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was\\nmyself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.”\\n\\nM. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned\\nthe conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.\\n\\nClerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his\\nliterary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He\\ncame to the university with the design of making himself complete\\nmaster of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for\\nthe plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no\\ninglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording\\nscope for his spirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit\\nlanguages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on\\nthe same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I\\nwished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt\\ngreat relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not\\nonly instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I\\ndid not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for\\nI did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary\\namusement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well\\nrepaid my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy\\nelevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of\\nany other country. When you read their writings, life appears to\\nconsist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns\\nof a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How\\ndifferent from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!\\n\\nSummer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was\\nfixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several\\naccidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,\\nand my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. I felt this\\ndelay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved\\nfriends. My return had only been delayed so long, from an\\nunwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become\\nacquainted with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent\\ncheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came\\nits beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.\\n\\nThe month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily\\nwhich was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a\\npedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a\\npersonal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited. I acceded\\nwith pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval\\nhad always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature\\nthat I had taken among the scenes of my native country.\\n\\nWe passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits\\nhad long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the\\nsalubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and\\nthe conversation of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the\\nintercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but\\nClerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught\\nme to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.\\nExcellent friend! how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to\\nelevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. A selfish\\npursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and\\naffection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature\\nwho, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.\\nWhen happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most\\ndelightful sensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with\\necstasy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring\\nbloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud. I\\nwas undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed\\nupon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an\\ninvincible burden.\\n\\nHenry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he\\nexerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled\\nhis soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly\\nastonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in\\nimitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful\\nfancy and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew\\nme out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.\\n\\nWe returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were\\ndancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits were\\nhigh, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 7\\n\\n\\nOn my return, I found the following letter from my father:—\\n\\n“My dear Victor,\\n\\n“You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of\\nyour return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few\\nlines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But\\nthat would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be\\nyour surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to\\nbehold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can\\nI relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous to\\nour joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent\\nson? I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is\\nimpossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words\\nwhich are to convey to you the horrible tidings.\\n\\n“William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed\\nmy heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered!\\n\\n“I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the\\ncircumstances of the transaction.\\n\\n“Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to\\nwalk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged\\nour walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of\\nreturning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone\\non before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until\\nthey should return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen\\nhis brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William\\nhad run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and\\nafterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.\\n\\n“This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him\\nuntil night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have\\nreturned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with\\ntorches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had\\nlost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;\\nElizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I\\ndiscovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and\\nactive in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the\\nprint of the murder’s finger was on his neck.\\n\\n“He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my\\ncountenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to\\nsee the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted,\\nand entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the\\nvictim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘O God! I have murdered my\\ndarling child!’\\n\\n“She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again\\nlived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same\\nevening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable\\nminiature that she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and\\nwas doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We\\nhave no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him\\nare unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!\\n\\n“Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps\\ncontinually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death;\\nher words pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an\\nadditional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?\\nYour dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live\\nto witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!\\n\\n“Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin,\\nbut with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of\\nfestering, the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my\\nfriend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not\\nwith hatred for your enemies.\\n\\n“Your affectionate and afflicted father,\\n\\n“Alphonse Frankenstein.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”\\n\\n\\n\\nClerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was\\nsurprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first\\nexpressed on receiving news from my friends. I threw the letter on the\\ntable, and covered my face with my hands.\\n\\n“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me\\nweep with bitterness, “are you always to be unhappy? My dear friend,\\nwhat has happened?”\\n\\nI motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the\\nroom in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of\\nClerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.\\n\\n“I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he;\\n“your disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?”\\n\\n“To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.”\\n\\nDuring our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation;\\nhe could only express his heartfelt sympathy. “Poor William!” said he,\\n“dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that had\\nseen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his\\nuntimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel the murderer’s grasp! How\\nmuch more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence! Poor little\\nfellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but\\nhe is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.\\nA sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer\\nbe a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable\\nsurvivors.”\\n\\nClerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words\\nimpressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in\\nsolitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a\\ncabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.\\n\\nMy journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed\\nto console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I\\ndrew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain\\nthe multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through\\nscenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years.\\nHow altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and\\ndesolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances\\nmight have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were\\ndone more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I\\ndared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble,\\nalthough I was unable to define them.\\n\\nI remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I\\ncontemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the\\nsnowy mountains, “the palaces of nature,” were not changed. By\\ndegrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey\\ntowards Geneva.\\n\\nThe road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I\\napproached my native town. I discovered more distinctly the black\\nsides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a\\nchild. “Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your\\nwanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and\\nplacid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?”\\n\\nI fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on\\nthese preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative\\nhappiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved\\ncountry! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again\\nbeholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely\\nlake!\\n\\nYet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also\\nclosed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still\\nmore gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I\\nforesaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human\\nbeings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single\\ncircumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not\\nconceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.\\n\\nIt was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates\\nof the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at\\nSecheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. The sky\\nwas serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot\\nwhere my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the\\ntown, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.\\nDuring this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont\\nBlanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach\\nrapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its\\nprogress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain\\ncoming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.\\n\\nI quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm\\nincreased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash\\nover my head. It was echoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of\\nSavoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the\\nlake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant\\nevery thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself\\nfrom the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in\\nSwitzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The\\nmost violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the\\nlake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of\\nCopêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another\\ndarkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain to the\\neast of the lake.\\n\\nWhile I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with\\na hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my\\nhands, and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel! this is thy\\nfuneral, this thy dirge!” As I said these words, I perceived in the\\ngloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood\\nfixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning\\nilluminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its\\ngigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs\\nto humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy\\ndæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I\\nshuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that\\nidea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth\\nchattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure\\npassed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could\\nhave destroyed the fair child. _He_ was the murderer! I could not\\ndoubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the\\nfact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for\\nanother flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly\\nperpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the\\nsouth. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.\\n\\nI remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still\\ncontinued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I\\nrevolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:\\nthe whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of\\nthe works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure. Two years had\\nnow nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and\\nwas this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a\\ndepraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not\\nmurdered my brother?\\n\\nNo one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the\\nnight, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not\\nfeel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in\\nscenes of evil and despair. I considered the being whom I had cast\\namong mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes\\nof horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light\\nof my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced\\nto destroy all that was dear to me.\\n\\nDay dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were\\nopen, and I hastened to my father’s house. My first thought was to\\ndiscover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be\\nmade. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A\\nbeing whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at\\nmidnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I\\nremembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at\\nthe time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of\\ndelirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that\\nif any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have\\nlooked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature\\nof the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited\\nas to persuade my relatives to commence it. And then of what use would\\nbe pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the\\noverhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These reflections determined me, and\\nI resolved to remain silent.\\n\\nIt was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house. I\\ntold the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library\\nto attend their usual hour of rising.\\n\\nSix years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I\\nstood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my\\ndeparture for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained\\nto me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the\\nmantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my father’s\\ndesire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling\\nby the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;\\nbut there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the\\nsentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my\\ntears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest\\nentered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:\\n“Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you\\nhad come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and\\ndelighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can\\nalleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems\\nsinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor\\nElizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—Poor\\nWilliam! he was our darling and our pride!”\\n\\nTears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal\\nagony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the\\nwretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and\\na not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more\\nminutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.\\n\\n“She most of all,” said Ernest, “requires consolation; she accused\\nherself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her\\nvery wretched. But since the murderer has been discovered—”\\n\\n“The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt\\nto pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the\\nwinds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he\\nwas free last night!”\\n\\n“I do not know what you mean,” replied my brother, in accents of\\nwonder, “but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. No\\none would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be\\nconvinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit\\nthat Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family,\\ncould suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?”\\n\\n“Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is\\nwrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?”\\n\\n“No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have\\nalmost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so\\nconfused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear,\\nleaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried today, and you will\\nthen hear all.”\\n\\nHe then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William\\nhad been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her\\nbed for several days. During this interval, one of the servants,\\nhappening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the\\nmurder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which\\nhad been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant\\ninstantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to\\nany of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,\\nJustine was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the poor girl\\nconfirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of\\nmanner.\\n\\nThis was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied\\nearnestly, “You are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor,\\ngood Justine, is innocent.”\\n\\nAt that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed\\non his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,\\nafter we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced\\nsome other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed,\\n“Good God, papa! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of\\npoor William.”\\n\\n“We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father, “for indeed I had\\nrather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much\\ndepravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.”\\n\\n“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”\\n\\n“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be\\ntried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”\\n\\nThis speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that\\nJustine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I\\nhad no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be\\nbrought forward strong enough to convict her. My tale was not one to\\nannounce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as\\nmadness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except I, the\\ncreator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the\\nexistence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance\\nwhich I had let loose upon the world?\\n\\nWe were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last\\nbeheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of\\nher childish years. There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but\\nit was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.\\nShe welcomed me with the greatest affection. “Your arrival, my dear\\ncousin,” said she, “fills me with hope. You perhaps will find some\\nmeans to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she\\nbe convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do\\nupon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only\\nlost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely\\nlove, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I\\nnever shall know joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not;\\nand then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little\\nWilliam.”\\n\\n“She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” said I, “and that shall\\nbe proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance\\nof her acquittal.”\\n\\n“How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt,\\nand that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to\\nsee every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me\\nhopeless and despairing.” She wept.\\n\\n“Dearest niece,” said my father, “dry your tears. If she\\nis, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the\\nactivity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of\\npartiality.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8\\n\\n\\nWe passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock, when the trial was to\\ncommence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend\\nas witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of\\nthis wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture. It was to\\nbe decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would\\ncause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of\\ninnocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every\\naggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.\\nJustine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised\\nto render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an\\nignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I\\nhave confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I\\nwas absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have\\nbeen considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have\\nexculpated her who suffered through me.\\n\\nThe appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and\\nher countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her\\nfeelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in\\ninnocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by\\nthousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have\\nexcited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the\\nimagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She\\nwas tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as\\nher confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she\\nworked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the\\ncourt she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were\\nseated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly\\nrecovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest\\nher utter guiltlessness.\\n\\nThe trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the\\ncharge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined\\nagainst her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof\\nof her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on\\nwhich the murder had been committed and towards morning had been\\nperceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the\\nmurdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her what she\\ndid there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused\\nand unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight\\no’clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she\\nreplied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly\\nif anything had been heard concerning him. When shown the body, she\\nfell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The\\npicture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;\\nand when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same\\nwhich, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round\\nhis neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.\\n\\nJustine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her\\ncountenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly\\nexpressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was\\ndesired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible\\nalthough variable voice.\\n\\n“God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent. But I\\ndo not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence\\non a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced\\nagainst me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my\\njudges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears\\ndoubtful or suspicious.”\\n\\nShe then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed\\nthe evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the\\nhouse of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league from\\nGeneva. On her return, at about nine o’clock, she met a man who asked\\nher if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. She was\\nalarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him,\\nwhen the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain\\nseveral hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being\\nunwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Most\\nof the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that\\nshe slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.\\nIt was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour\\nto find my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay,\\nit was without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered when\\nquestioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed\\na sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.\\nConcerning the picture she could give no account.\\n\\n“I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and\\nfatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of\\nexplaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left\\nto conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been\\nplaced in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have no\\nenemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me\\nwantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity\\nafforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the\\njewel, to part with it again so soon?\\n\\n“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for\\nhope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my\\ncharacter, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed\\nguilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my\\ninnocence.”\\n\\nSeveral witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and\\nthey spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they\\nsupposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come\\nforward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent\\ndispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,\\nwhen, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address\\nthe court.\\n\\n“I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who\\nwas murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived\\nwith his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may\\ntherefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but\\nwhen I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her\\npretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I\\nknow of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived\\nin the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly\\ntwo years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and\\nbenevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in\\nher last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards\\nattended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited\\nthe admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my\\nuncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was\\nwarmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a\\nmost affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,\\nnotwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely\\non her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action; as to\\nthe bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it,\\nI should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value\\nher.”\\n\\nA murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth’s simple and powerful\\nappeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in\\nfavour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with\\nrenewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She\\nherself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My own\\nagitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I believed\\nin her innocence; I knew it. Could the dæmon who had (I did not for a\\nminute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have\\nbetrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? I could not sustain the\\nhorror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and\\nthe countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim,\\nI rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused did\\nnot equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of\\nremorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.\\n\\nI passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to\\nthe court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal\\nquestion, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my\\nvisit. The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine\\nwas condemned.\\n\\nI cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before\\nexperienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon\\nthem adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the\\nheart-sickening despair that I then endured. The person to whom I\\naddressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.\\n“That evidence,” he observed, “was hardly required in so glaring a\\ncase, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to\\ncondemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so\\ndecisive.”\\n\\nThis was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had\\nmy eyes deceived me? And was I really as mad as the whole world would\\nbelieve me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions? I\\nhastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.\\n\\n“My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided as you may have expected; all\\njudges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty\\nshould escape. But she has confessed.”\\n\\nThis was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon\\nJustine’s innocence. “Alas!” said she. “How shall I\\never again believe in human goodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as\\nmy sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?\\nHer mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has\\ncommitted a murder.”\\n\\nSoon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my\\ncousin. My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own\\njudgment and feelings to decide. “Yes,” said Elizabeth,\\n“I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany\\nme; I cannot go alone.” The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet\\nI could not refuse.\\n\\nWe entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some\\nstraw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on\\nher knees. She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with\\nher, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My\\ncousin wept also.\\n\\n“Oh, Justine!” said she. “Why did you rob me of my last consolation?\\nI relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I\\nwas not so miserable as I am now.”\\n\\n“And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also\\njoin with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?” Her\\nvoice was suffocated with sobs.\\n\\n“Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth; “why do you kneel,\\nif you are innocent? I am not one of your enemies, I believed you\\nguiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had\\nyourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be\\nassured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a\\nmoment, but your own confession.”\\n\\n“I did confess, but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might\\nobtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than\\nall my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was\\ncondemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced,\\nuntil I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I\\nwas. He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if\\nI continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked\\non me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do?\\nIn an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly\\nmiserable.”\\n\\nShe paused, weeping, and then continued, “I thought with horror, my\\nsweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed\\naunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable\\nof a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.\\nDear William! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again in\\nheaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I\\nam to suffer ignominy and death.”\\n\\n“Oh, Justine! Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.\\nWhy did you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. I\\nwill proclaim, I will prove your innocence. I will melt the stony\\nhearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers. You shall not die!\\nYou, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!\\nNo! No! I never could survive so horrible a misfortune.”\\n\\nJustine shook her head mournfully. “I do not fear to die,” she said;\\n“that pang is past. God raises my weakness and gives me courage to\\nendure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember\\nme and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the\\nfate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to\\nthe will of heaven!”\\n\\nDuring this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room,\\nwhere I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair!\\nWho dared talk of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass\\nthe awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such\\ndeep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth and ground them together,\\nuttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When\\nshe saw who it was, she approached me and said, “Dear sir, you are very\\nkind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?”\\n\\nI could not answer. “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is more\\nconvinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you\\nhad confessed, he did not credit it.”\\n\\n“I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest\\ngratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is\\nthe affection of others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than\\nhalf my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my\\ninnocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.”\\n\\nThus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed\\ngained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the\\nnever-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or\\nconsolation. Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was\\nthe misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair\\nmoon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and\\ndespair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within\\nme which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours with\\nJustine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear\\nherself away. “I wish,” cried she, “that I were to die with you; I\\ncannot live in this world of misery.”\\n\\nJustine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty\\nrepressed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice\\nof half-suppressed emotion, “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth,\\nmy beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and\\npreserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever\\nsuffer! Live, and be happy, and make others so.”\\n\\nAnd on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth’s heart-rending eloquence\\nfailed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the\\ncriminality of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and indignant\\nappeals were lost upon them. And when I received their cold answers\\nand heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed\\navowal died away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a madman,\\nbut not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. She\\nperished on the scaffold as a murderess!\\n\\nFrom the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and\\nvoiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And my\\nfather’s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was\\nthe work of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these\\nare not your last tears! Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and\\nthe sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!\\nFrankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he\\nwho would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no\\nthought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear\\ncountenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life\\nin serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond\\nhis hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction\\npause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!\\n\\nThus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair,\\nI beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and\\nJustine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 9\\n\\n\\nNothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have\\nbeen worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of\\ninaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope\\nand fear. Justine died, she rested, and I was alive. The blood flowed\\nfreely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my\\nheart which nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered\\nlike an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond\\ndescription horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet\\nbehind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.\\nI had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment\\nwhen I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow\\nbeings. Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience\\nwhich allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and\\nfrom thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and\\nthe sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures\\nsuch as no language can describe.\\n\\nThis state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never\\nentirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned\\nthe face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me;\\nsolitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, deathlike solitude.\\n\\nMy father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition\\nand habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his\\nserene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and\\nawaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.\\n“Do you think, Victor,” said he, “that I do not suffer\\nalso? No one could love a child more than I loved your\\nbrother”—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—“but\\nis it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting\\ntheir unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty\\nowed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment,\\nor even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for\\nsociety.”\\n\\nThis advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I\\nshould have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if\\nremorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my\\nother sensations. Now I could only answer my father with a look of\\ndespair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.\\n\\nAbout this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was\\nparticularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates regularly at\\nten o’clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that\\nhour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome\\nto me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had\\nretired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the\\nwater. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and\\nsometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to\\npursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I\\nwas often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only\\nunquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and\\nheavenly—if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and\\ninterrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often,\\nI say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters\\nmight close over me and my calamities for ever. But I was restrained,\\nwhen I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly\\nloved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of my\\nfather and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them\\nexposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose\\namong them?\\n\\nAt these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my\\nmind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that\\ncould not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of\\nunalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had\\ncreated should perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling\\nthat all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime,\\nwhich by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.\\nThere was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained\\nbehind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of\\nhim I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to\\nextinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I\\nreflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds\\nof moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the\\nAndes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wished\\nto see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his\\nhead and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.\\n\\nOur house was the house of mourning. My father’s health was deeply\\nshaken by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and\\ndesponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all\\npleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she\\nthen thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted\\nand destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth\\nwandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our\\nfuture prospects. The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from\\nthe earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest\\nsmiles.\\n\\n“When I reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the miserable death of\\nJustine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before\\nappeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and\\ninjustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient\\ndays or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to\\nreason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men\\nappear to me as monsters thirsting for each other’s blood. Yet I am\\ncertainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and\\nif she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly\\nshe would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the sake\\nof a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend,\\na child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if\\nit had been her own! I could not consent to the death of any human\\nbeing, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to\\nremain in the society of men. But she was innocent. I know, I feel\\nshe was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.\\nAlas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can\\nassure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I were walking on\\nthe edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and\\nendeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were\\nassassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free,\\nand perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the\\nscaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a\\nwretch.”\\n\\nI listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed,\\nbut in effect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my anguish in my\\ncountenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, “My dearest friend, you\\nmust calm yourself. These events have affected me, God knows how\\ndeeply; but I am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of\\ndespair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me\\ntremble. Dear Victor, banish these dark passions. Remember the\\nfriends around you, who centre all their hopes in you. Have we lost\\nthe power of rendering you happy? Ah! While we love, while we are\\ntrue to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native\\ncountry, we may reap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb our\\npeace?”\\n\\nAnd could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every\\nother gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my\\nheart? Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at\\nthat very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.\\n\\nThus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of\\nheaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were\\nineffectual. I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial\\ninfluence could penetrate. The wounded deer dragging its fainting\\nlimbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had\\npierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.\\n\\nSometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but\\nsometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily\\nexercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable\\nsensations. It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left\\nmy home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought\\nin the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and\\nmy ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My wanderings were directed\\ntowards the valley of Chamounix. I had visited it frequently during my\\nboyhood. Six years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but nought\\nhad changed in those savage and enduring scenes.\\n\\nI performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards\\nhired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive\\ninjury on these rugged roads. The weather was fine; it was about the\\nmiddle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of\\nJustine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe. The\\nweight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in\\nthe ravine of Arve. The immense mountains and precipices that overhung\\nme on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and\\nthe dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as\\nOmnipotence—and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less\\nalmighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here\\ndisplayed in their most terrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher,\\nthe valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.\\nRuined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the\\nimpetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from\\namong the trees formed a scene of singular beauty. But it was\\naugmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and\\nshining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another\\nearth, the habitations of another race of beings.\\n\\nI passed the bridge of Pélissier, where the ravine, which the river\\nforms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that\\noverhangs it. Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix. This\\nvalley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and\\npicturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed. The\\nhigh and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no\\nmore ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers approached\\nthe road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and\\nmarked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and\\nmagnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_,\\nand its tremendous _dôme_ overlooked the valley.\\n\\nA tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this\\njourney. Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and\\nrecognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the\\nlighthearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing\\naccents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more. Then again the\\nkindly influence ceased to act—I found myself fettered again to grief\\nand indulging in all the misery of reflection. Then I spurred on my\\nanimal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,\\nmyself—or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on\\nthe grass, weighed down by horror and despair.\\n\\nAt length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded\\nto the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured.\\nFor a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid\\nlightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of\\nthe Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath. The same lulling sounds\\nacted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head\\nupon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed\\nthe giver of oblivion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 10\\n\\n\\nI spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside\\nthe sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that\\nwith slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to\\nbarricade the valley. The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before\\nme; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were\\nscattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious\\npresence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling\\nwaves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the\\navalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the\\naccumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,\\nwas ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in\\ntheir hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the\\ngreatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me\\nfrom all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my\\ngrief, they subdued and tranquillised it. In some degree, also, they\\ndiverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the\\nlast month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,\\nwaited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I\\nhad contemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the\\nunstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,\\nand ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they all\\ngathered round me and bade me be at peace.\\n\\nWhere had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of\\nsoul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every\\nthought. The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the\\nsummits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those\\nmighty friends. Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them\\nin their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule was\\nbrought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of\\nMontanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous\\nand ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.\\nIt had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the\\nsoul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.\\nThe sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the\\neffect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing\\ncares of life. I determined to go without a guide, for I was well\\nacquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the\\nsolitary grandeur of the scene.\\n\\nThe ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short\\nwindings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the\\nmountain. It is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots\\nthe traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie\\nbroken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,\\nleaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon\\nother trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines\\nof snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is\\nparticularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking\\nin a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw\\ndestruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or\\nluxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.\\nI looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers\\nwhich ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite\\nmountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain\\npoured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I\\nreceived from the objects around me. Alas! Why does man boast of\\nsensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders\\nthem more necessary beings. If our impulses were confined to hunger,\\nthirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by\\nevery wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may\\nconvey to us.\\n\\n  We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.\\n     We rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.\\n  We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,\\n     Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;\\n  It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,\\n     The path of its departure still is free.\\n  Man’s yesterday may ne’er be like his morrow;\\n     Nought may endure but mutability!\\n\\n\\nIt was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some\\ntime I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered\\nboth that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated\\nthe cloud, and I descended upon the glacier. The surface is very\\nuneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and\\ninterspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost a\\nleague in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The\\nopposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I\\nnow stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;\\nand above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess\\nof the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea,\\nor rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,\\nwhose aerial summits hung over its recesses. Their icy and glittering\\npeaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was\\nbefore sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed,\\n“Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow\\nbeds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion,\\naway from the joys of life.”\\n\\nAs I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,\\nadvancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the\\ncrevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his\\nstature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was\\ntroubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me,\\nbut I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. I\\nperceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)\\nthat it was the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and\\nhorror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in\\nmortal combat. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,\\ncombined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness\\nrendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely\\nobserved this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance,\\nand I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious\\ndetestation and contempt.\\n\\n“Devil,” I exclaimed, “do you dare approach me? And do\\nnot you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?\\nBegone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! And,\\noh! That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore\\nthose victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!”\\n\\n“I expected this reception,” said the dæmon. “All men hate the\\nwretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all\\nliving things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature,\\nto whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of\\none of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life?\\nDo your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of\\nmankind. If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and\\nyou at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it\\nbe satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.”\\n\\n“Abhorred monster! Fiend that thou art! The tortures of hell are too\\nmild a vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! You reproach me with\\nyour creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I\\nso negligently bestowed.”\\n\\nMy rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the\\nfeelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.\\n\\nHe easily eluded me and said,\\n\\n“Be calm! I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred\\non my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to\\nincrease my misery? Life, although it may only be an accumulation of\\nanguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember, thou hast made\\nme more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my\\njoints more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in\\nopposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and\\ndocile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part,\\nthe which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every\\nother and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy\\nclemency and affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature;\\nI ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou\\ndrivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I\\nalone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made\\nme a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.”\\n\\n“Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between you\\nand me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight,\\nin which one must fall.”\\n\\n“How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a\\nfavourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and\\ncompassion? Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed\\nwith love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my\\ncreator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures,\\nwho owe me nothing? They spurn and hate me. The desert mountains and\\ndreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the\\ncaves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the\\nonly one which man does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they\\nare kinder to me than your fellow beings. If the multitude of mankind\\nknew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for\\nmy destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keep\\nno terms with my enemies. I am miserable, and they shall share my\\nwretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver\\nthem from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that\\nnot only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be\\nswallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion be\\nmoved, and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale; when you have heard\\nthat, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve.\\nBut hear me. The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they\\nare, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned. Listen\\nto me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with\\na satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the\\neternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me,\\nand then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.”\\n\\n“Why do you call to my remembrance,” I rejoined, “circumstances of\\nwhich I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and\\nauthor? Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw\\nlight! Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you!\\nYou have made me wretched beyond expression. You have left me no power\\nto consider whether I am just to you or not. Begone! Relieve me from\\nthe sight of your detested form.”\\n\\n“Thus I relieve thee, my creator,” he said, and placed his hated hands\\nbefore my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; “thus I take from\\nthee a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen to me and grant\\nme thy compassion. By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this\\nfrom you. Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of\\nthis place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon\\nthe mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends\\nto hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another\\nworld, you will have heard my story and can decide. On you it rests,\\nwhether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless\\nlife, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of\\nyour own speedy ruin.”\\n\\nAs he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed. My heart\\nwas full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the\\nvarious arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to\\nhis tale. I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my\\nresolution. I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my\\nbrother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.\\nFor the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards\\nhis creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I\\ncomplained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with\\nhis demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite\\nrock. The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we\\nentered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy\\nheart and depressed spirits. But I consented to listen, and seating\\nmyself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began\\nhis tale.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 11\\n\\n\\n“It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of\\nmy being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.\\nA strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard,\\nand smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I\\nlearned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By\\ndegrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I\\nwas obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me and troubled\\nme, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now\\nsuppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked and, I believe,\\ndescended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.\\nBefore, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my\\ntouch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with\\nno obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The light\\nbecame more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I\\nwalked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the\\nforest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting\\nfrom my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This\\nroused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I\\nfound hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst\\nat the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.\\n\\n“It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it\\nwere, instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted\\nyour apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some\\nclothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of\\nnight. I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could\\ndistinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat\\ndown and wept.\\n\\n“Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of\\npleasure. I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the\\ntrees. [The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly,\\nbut it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries.\\nI was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with\\nwhich I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No distinct\\nideas occupied my mind; all was confused. I felt light, and hunger,\\nand thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on\\nall sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could\\ndistinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with\\npleasure.\\n\\n“Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had\\ngreatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each\\nother. I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with\\ndrink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted\\nwhen I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my\\nears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had\\noften intercepted the light from my eyes. I began also to observe,\\nwith greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the\\nboundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I\\ntried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.\\nSometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the\\nuncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into\\nsilence again.\\n\\n“The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened\\nform, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest. My\\nsensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every\\nday additional ideas. My eyes became accustomed to the light and to\\nperceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from\\nthe herb, and by degrees, one herb from another. I found that the\\nsparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and\\nthrush were sweet and enticing.\\n\\n“One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been\\nleft by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the\\nwarmth I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live\\nembers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange,\\nI thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects! I\\nexamined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be\\ncomposed of wood. I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet\\nand would not burn. I was pained at this and sat still watching the\\noperation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed near the heat\\ndried and itself became inflamed. I reflected on this, and by touching\\nthe various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in\\ncollecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a\\nplentiful supply of fire. When night came on and brought sleep with\\nit, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I\\ncovered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches\\nupon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank\\ninto sleep.\\n\\n“It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.\\nI uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. I\\nobserved this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the\\nembers when they were nearly extinguished. When night came again I\\nfound, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that\\nthe discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found\\nsome of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and\\ntasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees. I\\ntried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on\\nthe live embers. I found that the berries were spoiled by this\\noperation, and the nuts and roots much improved.\\n\\n“Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day\\nsearching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When\\nI found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto\\ninhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be\\nmore easily satisfied. In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the\\nloss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how\\nto reproduce it. I gave several hours to the serious consideration of\\nthis difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply\\nit, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood\\ntowards the setting sun. I passed three days in these rambles and at\\nlength discovered the open country. A great fall of snow had taken\\nplace the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the\\nappearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold\\ndamp substance that covered the ground.\\n\\n“It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and\\nshelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which\\nhad doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This\\nwas a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great\\ncuriosity. Finding the door open, I entered. An old man sat in it,\\nnear a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned on\\nhearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the\\nhut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form\\nhardly appeared capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever\\nbefore seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted\\nby the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not\\npenetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite\\nand divine a retreat as Pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell\\nafter their sufferings in the lake of fire. I greedily devoured the\\nremnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,\\nmilk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like. Then, overcome by\\nfatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.\\n\\n“It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which\\nshone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my\\ntravels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in a\\nwallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until\\nat sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this appear! The\\nhuts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by\\nturns. The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw\\nplaced at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One\\nof the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within\\nthe door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.\\nThe whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,\\ngrievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I\\nescaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,\\nquite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had\\nbeheld in the village. This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat\\nand pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I\\ndared not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so\\nlow that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however,\\nwas placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and\\nalthough the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an\\nagreeable asylum from the snow and rain.\\n\\n“Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter,\\nhowever miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more\\nfrom the barbarity of man. As soon as morning dawned I crept from my\\nkennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could\\nremain in the habitation I had found. It was situated against the back\\nof the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig\\nsty and a clear pool of water. One part was open, and by that I had\\ncrept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived\\nwith stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on\\noccasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and\\nthat was sufficient for me.\\n\\n“Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I\\nretired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered\\ntoo well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. I\\nhad first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf\\nof coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink\\nmore conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by\\nmy retreat. The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept\\nperfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was\\ntolerably warm.\\n\\n“Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until\\nsomething should occur which might alter my determination. It was\\nindeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,\\nthe rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with\\npleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little\\nwater when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld\\na young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The\\ngirl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found\\ncottagers and farmhouse servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a\\ncoarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair\\nhair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. I lost\\nsight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing\\nthe pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along,\\nseemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose\\ncountenance expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds with\\nan air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the\\ncottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared. Presently I saw\\nthe young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field\\nbehind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the\\nhouse and sometimes in the yard.\\n\\n“On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the\\ncottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been\\nfilled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost\\nimperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.\\nThrough this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean\\nbut very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an\\nold man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The\\nyoung girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she\\ntook something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat\\ndown beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play\\nand to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the\\nnightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had\\nnever beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent\\ncountenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle\\nmanners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air\\nwhich I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of\\nwhich the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then\\npronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt\\nat his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection\\nthat I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were\\na mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced,\\neither from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the\\nwindow, unable to bear these emotions.\\n\\n“Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a\\nload of wood. The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of\\nhis burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on\\nthe fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,\\nand he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed\\npleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she\\nplaced in water, and then upon the fire. She afterwards continued her\\nwork, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily\\nemployed in digging and pulling up roots. After he had been employed\\nthus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the\\ncottage together.\\n\\n“The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance\\nof his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to\\neat. The meal was quickly dispatched. The young woman was again\\noccupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the\\ncottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.\\nNothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent\\ncreatures. One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming\\nwith benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his\\nfigure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his\\neyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. The\\nold man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different\\nfrom those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the\\nfields.\\n\\n“Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the\\ncottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was\\ndelighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the\\npleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the evening\\nthe young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations\\nwhich I did not understand; and the old man again took up the\\ninstrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in\\nthe morning. So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play,\\nbut to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the\\nharmony of the old man’s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since\\nfound that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the\\nscience of words or letters.\\n\\n“The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time,\\nextinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 12\\n\\n\\n“I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the\\noccurrences of the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners\\nof these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not. I\\nremembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from\\nthe barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I\\nmight hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would\\nremain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the\\nmotives which influenced their actions.\\n\\n“The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young woman\\narranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed\\nafter the first meal.\\n\\n“This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.\\nThe young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in\\nvarious laborious occupations within. The old man, whom I soon\\nperceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or\\nin contemplation. Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the\\nyounger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. They\\nperformed towards him every little office of affection and duty with\\ngentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.\\n\\n“They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often\\nwent apart and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness,\\nbut I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures were\\nmiserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,\\nshould be wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They\\npossessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every\\nluxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands\\nwhen hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,\\nthey enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each day\\nlooks of affection and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did they\\nreally express pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions,\\nbut perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which\\nwere at first enigmatic.\\n\\n“A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of\\nthe uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they\\nsuffered that evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment\\nconsisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of\\none cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters\\ncould scarcely procure food to support it. They often, I believe,\\nsuffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two\\nyounger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old\\nman when they reserved none for themselves.\\n\\n“This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed,\\nduring the night, to steal a part of their store for my own\\nconsumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on\\nthe cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and\\nroots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.\\n\\n“I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist\\ntheir labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day\\nin collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often\\ntook his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home\\nfiring sufficient for the consumption of several days.\\n\\n“I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she\\nopened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great\\npile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the\\nyouth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure,\\nthat he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the\\ncottage and cultivating the garden.\\n\\n“By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that\\nthese people possessed a method of communicating their experience and\\nfeelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words\\nthey spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the\\nminds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science,\\nand I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in\\nevery attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and\\nthe words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible\\nobjects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the\\nmystery of their reference. By great application, however, and after having\\nremained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I\\ndiscovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of\\ndiscourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and\\n_wood._ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth\\nand his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only\\none, which was _father._ The girl was called _sister_ or\\n_Agatha,_ and the youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_. I cannot\\ndescribe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of\\nthese sounds and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other\\nwords without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good,\\ndearest, unhappy._\\n\\n“I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of\\nthe cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I\\nfelt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I saw\\nfew human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the\\ncottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the\\nsuperior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive,\\noften endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that\\nhe called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a\\ncheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure\\neven upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled\\nwith tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I\\ngenerally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after\\nhaving listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus\\nwith Felix. He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my\\nunpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his\\nfriends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more\\ncheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old\\nman.\\n\\n“I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked\\nthe dispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty\\nand want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little\\nwhite flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in\\nthe morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that\\nobstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and\\nbrought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual\\nastonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible\\nhand. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring\\nfarmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner,\\nyet brought no wood with him. At other times he worked in the garden,\\nbut as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old\\nman and Agatha.\\n\\n“This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I\\ndiscovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when\\nhe talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs\\nfor speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend\\nthese also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand\\nthe sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however,\\nsensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of\\nconversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I\\neasily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to\\nthe cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become\\nmaster of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them\\noverlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast\\nperpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.\\n\\n“I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty,\\nand delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself\\nin a transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe that\\nit was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became\\nfully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was\\nfilled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.\\nAlas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable\\ndeformity.\\n\\n“As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow\\nvanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this\\ntime Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of\\nimpending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was\\ncoarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.\\nSeveral new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they\\ndressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season\\nadvanced.\\n\\n“The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did\\nnot rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its\\nwaters. This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the\\nearth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.\\n\\n“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I\\nattended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in\\nvarious occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in\\nobserving my friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any\\nmoon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected\\nmy own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it\\nwas necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those\\noffices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that these\\nlabours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and\\nonce or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _good\\nspirit, wonderful_; but I did not then understand the signification\\nof these terms.\\n\\n“My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the\\nmotives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to\\nknow why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad. I thought\\n(foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to\\nthese deserving people. When I slept or was absent, the forms of the\\nvenerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix\\nflitted before me. I looked upon them as superior beings who would be\\nthe arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in my imagination a\\nthousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of\\nme. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle\\ndemeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and\\nafterwards their love.\\n\\n“These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to\\nthe acquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but\\nsupple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their\\ntones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.\\nIt was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose\\nintentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved\\nbetter treatment than blows and execration.\\n\\n“The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the\\naspect of the earth. Men who before this change seemed to have been\\nhid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of\\ncultivation. The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves\\nbegan to bud forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! Fit habitation\\nfor gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and\\nunwholesome. My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of\\nnature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil,\\nand the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 13\\n\\n\\n“I now hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall relate\\nevents that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been,\\nhave made me what I am.\\n\\n“Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies\\ncloudless. It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy\\nshould now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. My\\nsenses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and\\na thousand sights of beauty.\\n\\n“It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested\\nfrom labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children\\nlistened to him—that I observed the countenance of Felix was\\nmelancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father\\npaused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired\\nthe cause of his son’s sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and\\nthe old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.\\n\\n“It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.\\nThe lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black\\nveil. Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by\\npronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was\\nmusical but unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word,\\nFelix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her\\nveil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. Her\\nhair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were\\ndark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular\\nproportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with\\na lovely pink.\\n\\n“Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of\\nsorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of\\necstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his\\neyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I\\nthought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by\\ndifferent feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held\\nout her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as\\nwell as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to\\nunderstand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and\\ndismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some\\nconversation took place between him and his father, and the young\\nstranger knelt at the old man’s feet and would have kissed his hand,\\nbut he raised her and embraced her affectionately.\\n\\n“I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds\\nand appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood\\nby nor herself understood the cottagers. They made many signs which I\\ndid not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness\\nthrough the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the\\nmorning mists. Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of\\ndelight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed\\nthe hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made\\nsigns which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she\\ncame. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances,\\nexpressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I\\nfound, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger\\nrepeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language;\\nand the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the\\nsame instructions to the same end. The stranger learned about twenty\\nwords at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had\\nbefore understood, but I profited by the others.\\n\\n“As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When they\\nseparated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, ‘Good night\\nsweet Safie.’ He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and\\nby the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely\\nguest was the subject of their conversation. I ardently desired to\\nunderstand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found\\nit utterly impossible.\\n\\n“The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual\\noccupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the\\nold man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly\\nbeautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my\\neyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or\\ndying away like a nightingale of the woods.\\n\\n“When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first\\ndeclined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in\\nsweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old\\nman appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to\\nexplain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she\\nbestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.\\n\\n“The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration\\nthat joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.\\nSafie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the\\nknowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most\\nof the words uttered by my protectors.\\n\\n“In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and\\nthe green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the\\nscent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;\\nthe sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal\\nrambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably\\nshortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never\\nventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same\\ntreatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.\\n\\n“My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily\\nmaster the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than\\nthe Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken\\naccents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that\\nwas spoken.\\n\\n“While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as\\nit was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field\\nfor wonder and delight.\\n\\n“The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s _Ruins\\nof Empires_. I should not have understood the purport of this book had not\\nFelix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this\\nwork, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the\\nEastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history\\nand a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave\\nme an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different\\nnations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous\\ngenius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue\\nof the early Romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the\\ndecline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard\\nof the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the\\nhapless fate of its original inhabitants.\\n\\n“These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was\\nman, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so\\nvicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil\\nprinciple and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and\\ngodlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour\\nthat can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on\\nrecord have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more\\nabject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long time I\\ncould not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or\\neven why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of\\nvice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and\\nloathing.\\n\\n“Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.\\nWhile I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the\\nArabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. I\\nheard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid\\npoverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.\\n\\n“The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the\\npossessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and\\nunsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with\\nonly one of these advantages, but without either he was considered,\\nexcept in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to\\nwaste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And what was I? Of\\nmy creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I\\npossessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides,\\nendued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even\\nof the same nature as man. I was more agile than they and could\\nsubsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with\\nless injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked\\naround I saw and heard of none like me. Was I, then, a monster, a blot\\nupon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?\\n\\n“I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted\\nupon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with\\nknowledge. Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor\\nknown nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!\\n\\n“Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind when it\\nhas once seized on it like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to\\nshake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one\\nmeans to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state\\nwhich I feared yet did not understand. I admired virtue and good\\nfeelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my\\ncottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except\\nthrough means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and\\nunknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of\\nbecoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha and the\\nanimated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me. The mild\\nexhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved\\nFelix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!\\n\\n“Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of the\\ndifference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the\\nfather doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the\\nolder child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up\\nin the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained\\nknowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which\\nbind one human being to another in mutual bonds.\\n\\n“But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my\\ninfant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if\\nthey had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I\\ndistinguished nothing. From my earliest remembrance I had been as I\\nthen was in height and proportion. I had never yet seen a being\\nresembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me. What was I? The\\nquestion again recurred, to be answered only with groans.\\n\\n“I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to\\nreturn to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various\\nfeelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated\\nin additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in\\nan innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 14\\n\\n\\n“Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. It was\\none which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding\\nas it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to\\none so utterly inexperienced as I was.\\n\\n“The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a good\\nfamily in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence,\\nrespected by his superiors and beloved by his equals. His son was bred\\nin the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the\\nhighest distinction. A few months before my arrival they had lived in\\na large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and\\npossessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or\\ntaste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.\\n\\n“The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a\\nTurkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some\\nreason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government.\\nHe was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from\\nConstantinople to join him. He was tried and condemned to death. The\\ninjustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant;\\nand it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime\\nalleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.\\n\\n“Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and\\nindignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the\\ncourt. He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then\\nlooked around for the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain\\nadmittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an\\nunguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the\\nunfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the\\nexecution of the barbarous sentence. Felix visited the grate at night\\nand made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. The Turk,\\namazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer\\nby promises of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his offers with\\ncontempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit\\nher father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the\\nyouth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed\\na treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.\\n\\n“The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made\\non the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in\\nhis interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he\\nshould be conveyed to a place of safety. Felix was too delicate to\\naccept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the\\nevent as to the consummation of his happiness.\\n\\n“During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for\\nthe escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several\\nletters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to\\nexpress her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old\\nman, a servant of her father who understood French. She thanked him in\\nthe most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and\\nat the same time she gently deplored her own fate.\\n\\n“I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence\\nin the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters\\nwere often in the hands of Felix or Agatha. Before I depart I will\\ngive them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present,\\nas the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat\\nthe substance of them to you.\\n\\n“Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a\\nslave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of\\nthe father of Safie, who married her. The young girl spoke in high and\\nenthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the\\nbondage to which she was now reduced. She instructed her daughter in\\nthe tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of\\nintellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female\\nfollowers of Muhammad. This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly\\nimpressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again\\nreturning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem,\\nallowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to\\nthe temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble\\nemulation for virtue. The prospect of marrying a Christian and\\nremaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in\\nsociety was enchanting to her.\\n\\n“The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night\\nprevious to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant\\nmany leagues from Paris. Felix had procured passports in the name of\\nhis father, sister, and himself. He had previously communicated his\\nplan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under\\nthe pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in\\nan obscure part of Paris.\\n\\n“Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont\\nCenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable\\nopportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.\\n\\n“Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his\\ndeparture, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she\\nshould be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in\\nexpectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society\\nof the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest\\naffection. They conversed with one another through the means of an\\ninterpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie\\nsang to him the divine airs of her native country.\\n\\n“The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes\\nof the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other\\nplans. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a\\nChristian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear\\nlukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer\\nif he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they\\ninhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled\\nto prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and\\nsecretly to take his daughter with him when he departed. His plans\\nwere facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.\\n\\n“The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their\\nvictim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. The\\nplot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were\\nthrown into prison. The news reached Felix and roused him from his\\ndream of pleasure. His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay\\nin a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of\\nher whom he loved. This idea was torture to him. He quickly arranged\\nwith the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity\\nfor escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a\\nboarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian,\\nhe hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the\\nlaw, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.\\n\\n“He did not succeed. They remained confined for five months before the\\ntrial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune\\nand condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.\\n\\n“They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I\\ndiscovered them. Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for\\nwhom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on\\ndiscovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin,\\nbecame a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with\\nhis daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him,\\nas he said, in some plan of future maintenance.\\n\\n“Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered\\nhim, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family. He could\\nhave endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his\\nvirtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss\\nof his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. The\\narrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.\\n\\n“When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth\\nand rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her\\nlover, but to prepare to return to her native country. The generous\\nnature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to\\nexpostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his\\ntyrannical mandate.\\n\\n“A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter’s apartment and told\\nher hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn\\nhad been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the\\nFrench government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to\\nConstantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours. He\\nintended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential\\nservant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his\\nproperty, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.\\n\\n“When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it\\nwould become her to pursue in this emergency. A residence in Turkey\\nwas abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse\\nto it. By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she\\nheard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where\\nhe then resided. She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her\\ndetermination. Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a\\nsum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn,\\nbut who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for\\nGermany.\\n\\n“She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage\\nof De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. Safie nursed her\\nwith the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the\\nArabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country\\nand utterly ignorant of the customs of the world. She fell, however,\\ninto good hands. The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for\\nwhich they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in\\nwhich they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at\\nthe cottage of her lover.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 15\\n\\n\\n“Such was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply.\\nI learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire\\ntheir virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.\\n\\n“As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and\\ngenerosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to\\nbecome an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities\\nwere called forth and displayed. But in giving an account of the\\nprogress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred\\nin the beginning of the month of August of the same year.\\n\\n“One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I\\ncollected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on\\nthe ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and\\nsome books. I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel. \\nFortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I\\nhad acquired at the cottage; they consisted of _Paradise Lost_, a volume\\nof _Plutarch’s Lives_, and the _Sorrows of Werter_. The\\npossession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually\\nstudied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were\\nemployed in their ordinary occupations.\\n\\n“I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced\\nin me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me\\nto ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In\\nthe _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting\\nstory, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon\\nwhat had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a\\nnever-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and\\ndomestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and\\nfeelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded\\nwell with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which\\nwere for ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a\\nmore divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character\\ncontained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon\\ndeath and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not\\npretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards\\nthe opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely\\nunderstanding it.\\n\\n“As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and\\ncondition. I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely\\nunlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I\\nwas a listener. I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I\\nwas unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.\\n‘The path of my departure was free,’ and there was none to lament my\\nannihilation. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. What did\\nthis mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my\\ndestination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to\\nsolve them.\\n\\n“The volume of _Plutarch’s Lives_ which I possessed contained the\\nhistories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book\\nhad a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_. I\\nlearned from Werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch\\ntaught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my\\nown reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many\\nthings I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a very\\nconfused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,\\nand boundless seas. But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and\\nlarge assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the\\nonly school in which I had studied human nature, but this book\\ndeveloped new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concerned\\nin public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the\\ngreatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as\\nfar as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they\\nwere, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these\\nfeelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa,\\nSolon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The\\npatriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a\\nfirm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had\\nbeen made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should\\nhave been imbued with different sensations.\\n\\n“But _Paradise Lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions. I read\\nit, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as\\na true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the\\npicture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of\\nexciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity\\nstruck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to\\nany other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine\\nin every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a\\nperfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of\\nhis Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from\\nbeings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.\\nMany times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for\\noften, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter\\ngall of envy rose within me.\\n\\n“Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon\\nafter my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of\\nthe dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had\\nneglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in\\nwhich they were written, I began to study them with diligence. It was\\nyour journal of the four months that preceded my creation. You\\nminutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress\\nof your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic\\noccurrences. You doubtless recollect these papers. Here they are.\\nEverything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed\\norigin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances\\nwhich produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious\\nand loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own\\nhorrors and rendered mine indelible. I sickened as I read. ‘Hateful\\nday when I received life!’ I exclaimed in agony. ‘Accursed creator!\\nWhy did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in\\ndisgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own\\nimage; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the\\nvery resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire\\nand encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.’\\n\\n“These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude;\\nbut when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and\\nbenevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should\\nbecome acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would\\ncompassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn\\nfrom their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion\\nand friendship? I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way\\nto fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. I\\npostponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance\\nattached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.\\nBesides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every\\nday’s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking\\nuntil a few more months should have added to my sagacity.\\n\\n“Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. The\\npresence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also\\nfound that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha\\nspent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in\\ntheir labours by servants. They did not appear rich, but they were\\ncontented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while\\nmine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only\\ndiscovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I\\ncherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person\\nreflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail\\nimage and that inconstant shade.\\n\\n“I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial\\nwhich in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my\\nthoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and\\ndared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my\\nfeelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed\\nsmiles of consolation. But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my\\nsorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. I remembered Adam’s\\nsupplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me,\\nand in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.\\n\\n“Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay\\nand fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it\\nhad worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did\\nnot heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my\\nconformation for the endurance of cold than heat. But my chief\\ndelights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay\\napparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention\\ntowards the cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the\\nabsence of summer. They loved and sympathised with one another; and\\ntheir joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the\\ncasualties that took place around them. The more I saw of them, the\\ngreater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my\\nheart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see\\ntheir sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost\\nlimit of my ambition. I dared not think that they would turn them from\\nme with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door were\\nnever driven away. I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a\\nlittle food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not\\nbelieve myself utterly unworthy of it.\\n\\n“The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken\\nplace since I awoke into life. My attention at this time was solely\\ndirected towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my\\nprotectors. I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally\\nfixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.\\nI had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my\\nperson was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly\\nbeheld me. My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I\\nthought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain\\nthe good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means\\nbe tolerated by my younger protectors.\\n\\n“One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground\\nand diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha,\\nand Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own\\ndesire, was left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed,\\nhe took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more\\nsweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. At first his\\ncountenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued,\\nthoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the\\ninstrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.\\n\\n“My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which\\nwould decide my hopes or realise my fears. The servants were gone to a\\nneighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an\\nexcellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my\\nlimbs failed me and I sank to the ground. Again I rose, and exerting\\nall the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had\\nplaced before my hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived\\nme, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their\\ncottage.\\n\\n“I knocked. ‘Who is there?’ said the old man. ‘Come in.’\\n\\n“I entered. ‘Pardon this intrusion,’ said I; ‘I am\\na traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you\\nwould allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.’\\n\\n“‘Enter,’ said De Lacey, ‘and I will try in what\\nmanner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are\\nfrom home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to\\nprocure food for you.’\\n\\n“‘Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is\\nwarmth and rest only that I need.’\\n\\n“I sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute was\\nprecious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence\\nthe interview, when the old man addressed me.\\n\\n‘By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you\\nFrench?’\\n\\n“‘No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that\\nlanguage only. I am now going to claim the protection of some friends,\\nwhom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.’\\n\\n“‘Are they Germans?’\\n\\n“‘No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an\\nunfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relation\\nor friend upon earth. These amiable people to whom I go have never\\nseen me and know little of me. I am full of fears, for if I fail\\nthere, I am an outcast in the world for ever.’\\n\\n“‘Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but\\nthe hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are\\nfull of brotherly love and charity. Rely, therefore, on your hopes;\\nand if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.’\\n\\n“‘They are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world;\\nbut, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I have good\\ndispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree\\nbeneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they\\nought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable\\nmonster.’\\n\\n“‘That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot\\nyou undeceive them?’\\n\\n“‘I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I\\nfeel so many overwhelming terrors. I tenderly love these friends; I\\nhave, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily\\nkindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and\\nit is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.’\\n\\n“‘Where do these friends reside?’\\n\\n“‘Near this spot.’\\n\\n“The old man paused and then continued, ‘If you will unreservedly\\nconfide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in\\nundeceiving them. I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but\\nthere is something in your words which persuades me that you are\\nsincere. I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure\\nto be in any way serviceable to a human creature.’\\n\\n“‘Excellent man! I thank you and accept your generous offer. You\\nraise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid,\\nI shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow\\ncreatures.’\\n\\n“‘Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for that can only\\ndrive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. I also am\\nunfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent;\\njudge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.’\\n\\n“‘How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your lips\\nfirst have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall\\nbe for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success\\nwith those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.’\\n\\n“‘May I know the names and residence of those friends?’\\n\\n“I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to\\nrob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever. I struggled vainly for\\nfirmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my\\nremaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud. At that\\nmoment I heard the steps of my younger protectors. I had not a moment\\nto lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, ‘Now is the\\ntime! Save and protect me! You and your family are the friends whom I\\nseek. Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!’\\n\\n“‘Great God!’ exclaimed the old man. ‘Who are you?’\\n\\n“At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and\\nAgatha entered. Who can describe their horror and consternation on\\nbeholding me? Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her\\nfriend, rushed out of the cottage. Felix darted forward, and with\\nsupernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in\\na transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently\\nwith a stick. I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends\\nthe antelope. But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and\\nI refrained. I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when,\\novercome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general\\ntumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 16\\n\\n\\n“Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I\\nnot extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly\\nbestowed? I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my\\nfeelings were those of rage and revenge. I could with pleasure have\\ndestroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with\\ntheir shrieks and misery.\\n\\n“When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and\\nnow, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my\\nanguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had broken\\nthe toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging\\nthrough the wood with a stag-like swiftness. Oh! What a miserable\\nnight I passed! The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees\\nwaved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird\\nburst forth amidst the universal stillness. All, save I, were at rest\\nor in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and\\nfinding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread\\nhavoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed\\nthe ruin.\\n\\n“But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became\\nfatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in\\nthe sick impotence of despair. There was none among the myriads of men\\nthat existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness\\ntowards my enemies? No; from that moment I declared everlasting war\\nagainst the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me\\nand sent me forth to this insupportable misery.\\n\\n“The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was\\nimpossible to return to my retreat during that day. Accordingly I hid\\nmyself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours\\nto reflection on my situation.\\n\\n“The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some\\ndegree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the\\ncottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my\\nconclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that\\nmy conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a\\nfool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children. I\\nought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to\\nhave discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have\\nbeen prepared for my approach. But I did not believe my errors to be\\nirretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the\\ncottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my\\nparty.\\n\\n“These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound\\nsleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by\\npeaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever\\nacting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix\\ntearing me from his father’s feet. I awoke exhausted, and finding that\\nit was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in\\nsearch of food.\\n\\n“When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the\\nwell-known path that conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace.\\nI crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the\\naccustomed hour when the family arose. That hour passed, the sun\\nmounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. I\\ntrembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside\\nof the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the\\nagony of this suspense.\\n\\n“Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they\\nentered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not\\nunderstand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country,\\nwhich differed from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix\\napproached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not\\nquitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from\\nhis discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.\\n\\n“‘Do you consider,’ said his companion to him,\\n‘that you will be obliged to pay three months’ rent and to lose\\nthe produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and\\nI beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your\\ndetermination.’\\n\\n“‘It is utterly useless,’ replied Felix; ‘we can\\nnever again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest\\ndanger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and\\nmy sister will never recover from their horror. I entreat you not to reason\\nwith me any more. Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this\\nplace.’\\n\\n“Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion\\nentered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then\\ndeparted. I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.\\n\\n“I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of\\nutter and stupid despair. My protectors had departed and had broken\\nthe only link that held me to the world. For the first time the\\nfeelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to\\ncontrol them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I\\nbent my mind towards injury and death. When I thought of my friends,\\nof the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the\\nexquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of\\ntears somewhat soothed me. But again when I reflected that they had\\nspurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to\\ninjure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As\\nnight advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,\\nand after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden,\\nI waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my\\noperations.\\n\\n“As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly\\ndispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore\\nalong like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my\\nspirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the\\ndry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,\\nmy eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon\\nnearly touched. A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my\\nbrand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath,\\nand bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned the fire, and the\\ncottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and\\nlicked it with their forked and destroying tongues.\\n\\n“As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of\\nthe habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.\\n\\n“And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I\\nresolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated\\nand despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the\\nthought of you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you\\nwere my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness\\nthan to him who had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had\\nbestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from\\nthese the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.\\nYou had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards\\nthis place I resolved to proceed.\\n\\n“But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a\\nsouthwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my\\nonly guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass\\nthrough, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I\\ndid not despair. From you only could I hope for succour, although\\ntowards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling,\\nheartless creator! You had endowed me with perceptions and passions\\nand then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.\\nBut on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I\\ndetermined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from\\nany other being that wore the human form.\\n\\n“My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense. It was\\nlate in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.\\nI travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a\\nhuman being. Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless;\\nrain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface\\nof the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh,\\nearth! How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! The\\nmildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall\\nand bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more\\ndeeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow\\nfell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents\\nnow and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I\\noften wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me\\nno respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could\\nnot extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived\\non the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth\\nand the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial\\nmanner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.\\n\\n“I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was\\nsecured by night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding\\nthat my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey\\nafter the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,\\ncheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of\\nthe air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long\\nappeared dead, revive within me. Half surprised by the novelty of\\nthese sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and\\nforgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft tears\\nagain bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with\\nthankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.\\n\\n“I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its\\nboundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many\\nof the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.\\nHere I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard\\nthe sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade\\nof a cypress. I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running\\ntowards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from\\nsomeone in sport. She continued her course along the precipitous sides\\nof the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the\\nrapid stream. I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour,\\nfrom the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. She\\nwas senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore\\nanimation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,\\nwho was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On\\nseeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms,\\nhastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I\\nhardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,\\nwhich he carried, at my body and fired. I sank to the ground, and my\\ninjurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.\\n\\n“This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being\\nfrom destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable\\npain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of\\nkindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments\\nbefore gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by\\npain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. But the\\nagony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.\\n\\n“For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to\\ncure the wound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder,\\nand I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any\\nrate I had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented\\nalso by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their\\ninfliction. My daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge,\\nsuch as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had\\nendured.\\n\\n“After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The\\nlabours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or\\ngentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my\\ndesolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for\\nthe enjoyment of pleasure.\\n\\n“But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I\\nreached the environs of Geneva.\\n\\n“It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among\\nthe fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply\\nto you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to\\nenjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting\\nbehind the stupendous mountains of Jura.\\n\\n“At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection,\\nwhich was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came\\nrunning into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of\\ninfancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this\\nlittle creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have\\nimbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him and\\neducate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in\\nthis peopled earth.\\n\\n“Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him\\ntowards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before\\nhis eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his\\nface and said, ‘Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to\\nhurt you; listen to me.’\\n\\n“He struggled violently. ‘Let me go,’ he cried;\\n‘monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. You\\nare an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.’\\n\\n“‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’\\n\\n“‘Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndic—he is M.\\nFrankenstein—he will punish you. You dare not keep me.’\\n\\n“‘Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I have\\nsworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’\\n\\n“The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried\\ndespair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a\\nmoment he lay dead at my feet.\\n\\n“I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish\\ntriumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, ‘I too can create desolation;\\nmy enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and\\na thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.’\\n\\n“As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his\\nbreast. I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite\\nof my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few moments I\\ngazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her\\nlovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was\\nfor ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could\\nbestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in\\nregarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one\\nexpressive of disgust and affright.\\n\\n“Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I only\\nwonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in\\nexclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the\\nattempt to destroy them.\\n\\n“While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had\\ncommitted the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I\\nentered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was\\nsleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her\\nwhose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the\\nloveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose\\njoy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. And then I bent over\\nher and whispered, ‘Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he who would\\ngive his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my\\nbeloved, awake!’\\n\\n“The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she\\nindeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus\\nwould she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.\\nThe thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me—not I, but\\nshe, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for ever\\nrobbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had\\nits source in her; be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons of\\nFelix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work\\nmischief. I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of\\nthe folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled.\\n\\n“For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place,\\nsometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and\\nits miseries for ever. At length I wandered towards these mountains,\\nand have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning\\npassion which you alone can gratify. We may not part until you have\\npromised to comply with my requisition. I am alone and miserable; man\\nwill not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself\\nwould not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same species\\nand have the same defects. This being you must create.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 17\\n\\n\\nThe being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the\\nexpectation of a reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to\\narrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his\\nproposition. He continued,\\n\\n“You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the\\ninterchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone\\ncan do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to\\nconcede.”\\n\\nThe latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had\\ndied away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and\\nas he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within\\nme.\\n\\n“I do refuse it,” I replied; “and no torture shall ever extort a\\nconsent from me. You may render me the most miserable of men, but you\\nshall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another like\\nyourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I\\nhave answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.”\\n\\n“You are in the wrong,” replied the fiend; “and instead\\nof threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I\\nam miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator,\\nwould tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I\\nshould pity man more than he pities me? You would not call it murder if you\\ncould precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the\\nwork of your own hands. Shall I respect man when he condemns me? Let him\\nlive with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would\\nbestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance.\\nBut that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our\\nunion. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I will\\nrevenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and\\nchiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear\\ninextinguishable hatred. Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor\\nfinish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of\\nyour birth.”\\n\\nA fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled\\ninto contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently\\nhe calmed himself and proceeded—\\n\\n“I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for you do\\nnot reflect that _you_ are the cause of its excess. If any being felt\\nemotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a\\nhundredfold; for that one creature’s sake I would make peace with the\\nwhole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised.\\nWhat I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of\\nanother sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it\\nis all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be\\nmonsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more\\nattached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be\\nharmless and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! My creator, make me\\nhappy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I\\nexcite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my\\nrequest!”\\n\\nI was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences\\nof my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.\\nHis tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature\\nof fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion\\nof happiness that it was in my power to bestow? He saw my change of\\nfeeling and continued,\\n\\n“If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see\\nus again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My food is not\\nthat of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite;\\nacorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will\\nbe of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare.\\nWe shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on\\nman and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful\\nand human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the\\nwantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me,\\nI now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment\\nand persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.”\\n\\n“You propose,” replied I, “to fly from the habitations of\\nman, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your\\nonly companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man,\\npersevere in this exile? You will return and again seek their kindness, and\\nyou will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed,\\nand you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction.\\nThis may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.”\\n\\n“How inconstant are your feelings! But a moment ago you were moved by\\nmy representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?\\nI swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that\\nwith the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man and\\ndwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil passions\\nwill have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! My life will flow quietly\\naway, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.”\\n\\nHis words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him and\\nsometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when\\nI saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my\\nfeelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle\\nthese sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathise with him, I\\nhad no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which\\nwas yet in my power to bestow.\\n\\n“You swear,” I said, “to be harmless; but have you not\\nalready shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust\\nyou? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by\\naffording a wider scope for your revenge?”\\n\\n“How is this? I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer. If\\nI have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion;\\nthe love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall\\nbecome a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant. My vices\\nare the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will\\nnecessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel\\nthe affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of\\nexistence and events from which I am now excluded.”\\n\\nI paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various\\narguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which\\nhe had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight\\nof all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had\\nmanifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my\\ncalculations; a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers\\nand hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices\\nwas a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a\\nlong pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and\\nmy fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request.\\nTurning to him, therefore, I said,\\n\\n“I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever,\\nand every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall\\ndeliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.”\\n\\n“I swear,” he cried, “by the sun, and by the blue sky of\\nheaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my\\nprayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. Depart to your\\nhome and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with\\nunutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall\\nappear.”\\n\\nSaying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in\\nmy sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than\\nthe flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the\\nsea of ice.\\n\\nHis tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of\\nthe horizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descent\\ntowards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my\\nheart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of winding among the\\nlittle paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced\\nperplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences\\nof the day had produced. Night was far advanced when I came to the\\nhalfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars\\nshone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines\\nrose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the\\nground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange\\nthoughts within me. I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I\\nexclaimed, “Oh! stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock\\nme; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as\\nnought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.”\\n\\nThese were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you\\nhow the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I\\nlistened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its\\nway to consume me.\\n\\nMorning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no\\nrest, but returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I could\\ngive no expression to my sensations—they weighed on me with a\\nmountain’s weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them.\\nThus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the\\nfamily. My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I\\nanswered no question, scarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were placed\\nunder a ban—as if I had no right to claim their sympathies—as if\\nnever more might I enjoy companionship with them. Yet even thus I\\nloved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate\\nmyself to my most abhorred task. The prospect of such an occupation\\nmade every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream,\\nand that thought only had to me the reality of life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 18\\n\\n\\nDay after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and\\nI could not collect the courage to recommence my work. I feared the\\nvengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my\\nrepugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not\\ncompose a female without again devoting several months to profound\\nstudy and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries\\nhaving been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was\\nmaterial to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my\\nfather’s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to\\nevery pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an\\nundertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to\\nme. A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had\\nhitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when\\nunchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My\\nfather saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts\\ntowards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy,\\nwhich every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring\\nblackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took\\nrefuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on the lake\\nalone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the\\nrippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and\\nbright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and\\non my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile\\nand a more cheerful heart.\\n\\nIt was after my return from one of these rambles that my father,\\ncalling me aside, thus addressed me,\\n\\n“I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former\\npleasures and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still\\nunhappy and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in\\nconjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me,\\nand if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a\\npoint would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.”\\n\\nI trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued—\\n\\n“I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your\\nmarriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the\\nstay of my declining years. You were attached to each other from your\\nearliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and\\ntastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of\\nman that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have\\nentirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any\\nwish that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another\\nwhom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to\\nElizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear\\nto feel.”\\n\\n“My dear father, reassure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and\\nsincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my\\nwarmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects are\\nentirely bound up in the expectation of our union.”\\n\\n“The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor,\\ngives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If you\\nfeel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast\\na gloom over us. But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so\\nstrong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate. Tell me,\\ntherefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the\\nmarriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us\\nfrom that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You\\nare younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent\\nfortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future\\nplans of honour and utility that you may have formed. Do not suppose,\\nhowever, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on\\nyour part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words\\nwith candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and\\nsincerity.”\\n\\nI listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable\\nof offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of\\nthoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! To me\\nthe idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and\\ndismay. I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled\\nand dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not\\nimpend over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival\\nwith this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the\\nground? I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with\\nhis mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from\\nwhich I expected peace.\\n\\nI remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to\\nEngland or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers\\nof that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable\\nuse to me in my present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining\\nthe desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I\\nhad an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my\\nloathsome task in my father’s house while in habits of familiar\\nintercourse with those I loved. I knew that a thousand fearful\\naccidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to\\nthrill all connected with me with horror. I was aware also that I\\nshould often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the\\nharrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my\\nunearthly occupation. I must absent myself from all I loved while thus\\nemployed. Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be\\nrestored to my family in peace and happiness. My promise fulfilled,\\nthe monster would depart for ever. Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some\\naccident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my\\nslavery for ever.\\n\\nThese feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to\\nvisit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I\\nclothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I\\nurged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to\\ncomply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that\\nresembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find\\nthat I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey,\\nand he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my\\nreturn, have restored me entirely to myself.\\n\\nThe duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or\\nat most a year, was the period contemplated. One paternal kind\\nprecaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. Without\\npreviously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth,\\narranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh. This interfered\\nwith the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the\\ncommencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be\\nan impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many\\nhours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between\\nme and the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone, would he not at times\\nforce his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to\\ncontemplate its progress?\\n\\nTo England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union\\nwith Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. My father’s\\nage rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one\\nreward I promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for my\\nunparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when,\\nenfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and\\nforget the past in my union with her.\\n\\nI now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me\\nwhich filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence I should\\nleave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and\\nunprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my\\ndeparture. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and\\nwould he not accompany me to England? This imagination was dreadful in\\nitself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.\\nI was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of\\nthis might happen. But through the whole period during which I was the\\nslave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of\\nthe moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend\\nwould follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his\\nmachinations.\\n\\nIt was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native\\ncountry. My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth\\ntherefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of\\nmy suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief. It had\\nbeen her care which provided me a companion in Clerval—and yet a man\\nis blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman’s\\nsedulous attention. She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand\\nconflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent\\nfarewell.\\n\\nI threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly\\nknowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.\\nI remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on\\nit, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with\\nme. Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful\\nand majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could\\nonly think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy\\nme whilst they endured.\\n\\nAfter some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed\\nmany leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for\\nClerval. He came. Alas, how great was the contrast between us! He\\nwas alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the\\nsetting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new\\nday. He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and\\nthe appearances of the sky. “This is what it is to live,” he cried;\\n“now I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are\\nyou desponding and sorrowful!” In truth, I was occupied by gloomy\\nthoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden\\nsunrise reflected in the Rhine. And you, my friend, would be far more\\namused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an\\neye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections. I, a\\nmiserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to\\nenjoyment.\\n\\nWe had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to\\nRotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London. During this\\nvoyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.\\nWe stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from\\nStrasburgh, arrived at Mainz. The course of the Rhine below Mainz\\nbecomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly and winds\\nbetween hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw\\nmany ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by\\nblack woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed,\\npresents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view\\nrugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with\\nthe dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,\\nflourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river\\nand populous towns occupy the scene.\\n\\nWe travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers\\nas we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits\\ncontinually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the\\nbottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to\\ndrink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these\\nwere my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had\\nbeen transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by\\nman. “I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes\\nof my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the\\nsnowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black\\nand impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance\\nwere it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay\\nappearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore\\nup whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be\\non the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain,\\nwhere the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and\\nwhere their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the\\nnightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud;\\nbut this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The\\nmountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a\\ncharm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.\\nLook at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the\\nisland, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now\\nthat group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village\\nhalf hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits\\nand guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who\\npile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of\\nour own country.”\\n\\nClerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words and\\nto dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a\\nbeing formed in the “very poetry of nature.” His wild and\\nenthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His\\nsoul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that\\ndevoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only\\nin the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to\\nsatisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard\\nonly with admiration, he loved with ardour:—\\n\\n    ——The sounding cataract\\n    Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,\\n    The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,\\n    Their colours and their forms, were then to him\\n    An appetite; a feeling, and a love,\\n    That had no need of a remoter charm,\\n    By thought supplied, or any interest\\n    Unborrow’d from the eye.\\n\\n          [Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey”.]\\n\\nAnd where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost\\nfor ever? Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful\\nand magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the\\nlife of its creator;—has this mind perished? Does it now only exist\\nin my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and\\nbeaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and\\nconsoles your unhappy friend.\\n\\nPardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight\\ntribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart,\\noverflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. I will\\nproceed with my tale.\\n\\nBeyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to\\npost the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of\\nthe river was too gentle to aid us.\\n\\nOur journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we\\narrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.\\nIt was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw\\nthe white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene;\\nthey were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the\\nremembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish\\nArmada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich—places which I had heard\\nof even in my country.\\n\\nAt length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul’s towering\\nabove all, and the Tower famed in English history.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 19\\n\\n\\nLondon was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several\\nmonths in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the\\nintercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this\\ntime, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally\\noccupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the\\ncompletion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of\\nintroduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most\\ndistinguished natural philosophers.\\n\\nIf this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,\\nit would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had\\ncome over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of\\nthe information they might give me on the subject in which my interest\\nwas so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I\\ncould fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of\\nHenry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory\\npeace. But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to\\nmy heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my\\nfellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and\\nJustine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled\\nmy soul with anguish.\\n\\nBut in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive\\nand anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of\\nmanners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of\\ninstruction and amusement. He was also pursuing an object he had long\\nhad in view. His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had\\nin his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had\\ntaken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of\\nEuropean colonization and trade. In Britain only could he further the\\nexecution of his plan. He was for ever busy, and the only check to his\\nenjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. I tried to conceal this\\nas much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures\\nnatural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by\\nany care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him,\\nalleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also\\nbegan to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this\\nwas to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling\\non the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme\\nanguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips\\nto quiver, and my heart to palpitate.\\n\\nAfter passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in\\nScotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the\\nbeauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient\\nallurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth,\\nwhere he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I,\\nalthough I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and\\nall the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.\\n\\nWe had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now\\nFebruary. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the\\nnorth at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not\\nintend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford,\\nMatlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of\\nthis tour about the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments and\\nthe materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some\\nobscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.\\n\\nWe quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at\\nWindsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us\\nmountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of\\nstately deer were all novelties to us.\\n\\nFrom thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds\\nwere filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted\\nthere more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles\\nI. had collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him,\\nafter the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of\\nParliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king and his\\ncompanions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and\\nson, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they\\nmight be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a\\ndwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these\\nfeelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of\\nthe city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.\\nThe colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost\\nmagnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows\\nof exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,\\nwhich reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and\\ndomes, embosomed among aged trees.\\n\\nI enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the\\nmemory of the past and the anticipation of the future. I was formed\\nfor peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never\\nvisited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what\\nis beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in\\nthe productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate\\nelasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has\\nentered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what\\nI shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,\\npitiable to others and intolerable to myself.\\n\\nWe passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs\\nand endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most\\nanimating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery\\nwere often prolonged by the successive objects that presented\\nthemselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the\\nfield on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated\\nfrom its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas\\nof liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments\\nand the remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains\\nand look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten\\ninto my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my\\nmiserable self.\\n\\nWe left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next\\nplace of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village\\nresembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but\\neverything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of\\ndistant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my\\nnative country. We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets\\nof natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same\\nmanner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name\\nmade me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit\\nMatlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.\\n\\nFrom Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in\\nCumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the\\nSwiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the\\nnorthern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the\\nrocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we\\nmade some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into\\nhappiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than\\nmine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found\\nin his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have\\nimagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his\\ninferiors. “I could pass my life here,” said he to me; “and among\\nthese mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”\\n\\nBut he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain\\namidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and\\nwhen he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit\\nthat on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again\\nengages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.\\n\\nWe had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland\\nand conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period\\nof our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them\\nto travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my\\npromise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon’s\\ndisappointment. He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance\\non my relatives. This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment\\nfrom which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited\\nfor my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was\\nmiserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I\\nsaw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to\\nread and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend\\nfollowed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.\\nWhen these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,\\nbut followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of\\nhis destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the\\nconsciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed\\ndrawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.\\n\\nI visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might\\nhave interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well\\nas Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.\\nBut the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic\\ncastle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’s\\nSeat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for\\nthe change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was\\nimpatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.\\n\\nWe left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew’s, and\\nalong the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.\\nBut I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into\\ntheir feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and\\naccordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland\\nalone. “Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be our\\nrendezvous. I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with\\nmy motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short\\ntime; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more\\ncongenial to your own temper.”\\n\\nHenry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to\\nremonstrate. He entreated me to write often. “I had rather be with\\nyou,” he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch\\npeople, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return,\\nthat I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in\\nyour absence.”\\n\\nHaving parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of\\nScotland and finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt but that the\\nmonster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have\\nfinished, that he might receive his companion.\\n\\nWith this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of\\nthe remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a place\\nfitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were\\ncontinually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely\\naffording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its\\ninhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs\\ngave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they\\nindulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from\\nthe mainland, which was about five miles distant.\\n\\nOn the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of\\nthese was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but two\\nrooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable\\npenury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the\\ndoor was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some\\nfurniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have\\noccasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been\\nbenumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at\\nand unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes\\nwhich I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations\\nof men.\\n\\nIn this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,\\nwhen the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to\\nlisten to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. It was a\\nmonotonous yet ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was\\nfar different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills\\nare covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the\\nplains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when\\ntroubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively\\ninfant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.\\n\\nIn this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but\\nas I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and\\nirksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my\\nlaboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night\\nin order to complete my work. It was, indeed, a filthy process in\\nwhich I was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind of\\nenthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my\\nmind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes\\nwere shut to the horror of my proceedings. But now I went to it in\\ncold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.\\n\\nThus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in\\na solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from\\nthe actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I\\ngrew restless and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my\\npersecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing\\nto raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much\\ndreaded to behold. I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow\\ncreatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.\\n\\nIn the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably\\nadvanced. I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager\\nhope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was\\nintermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken\\nin my bosom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 20\\n\\n\\nI sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just\\nrising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I\\nremained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my\\nlabour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention\\nto it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to\\nconsider the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before, I was\\nengaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled\\nbarbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest\\nremorse. I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was\\nalike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her\\nmate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had\\nsworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she\\nhad not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and\\nreasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her\\ncreation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived\\nloathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence\\nfor it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn\\nwith disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him,\\nand he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being\\ndeserted by one of his own species.\\n\\nEven if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world,\\nyet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon\\nthirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon\\nthe earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a\\ncondition precarious and full of terror. Had I right, for my own benefit,\\nto inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had before been moved\\nby the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by\\nhis fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my\\npromise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me\\nas their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at\\nthe price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.\\n\\nI trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by\\nthe light of the moon the dæmon at the casement. A ghastly grin\\nwrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task\\nwhich he had allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he\\nhad loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide\\nand desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the\\nfulfilment of my promise.\\n\\nAs I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of\\nmalice and treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my\\npromise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion,\\ntore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The wretch saw me\\ndestroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for\\nhappiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.\\n\\nI left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own\\nheart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I\\nsought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate\\nthe gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most\\nterrible reveries.\\n\\nSeveral hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea;\\nit was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature\\nreposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone\\nspecked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound\\nof voices as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the silence,\\nalthough I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear\\nwas suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a\\nperson landed close to my house.\\n\\nIn a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one\\nendeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a\\npresentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who\\ndwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation\\nof helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain\\nendeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.\\n\\nPresently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door\\nopened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he\\napproached me and said in a smothered voice,\\n\\n“You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you\\nintend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery;\\nI left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among\\nits willow islands and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many\\nmonths in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland. I have\\nendured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my\\nhopes?”\\n\\n“Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like\\nyourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.”\\n\\n“Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself\\nunworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe\\nyourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of\\nday will be hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your master;\\nobey!”\\n\\n“The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is\\narrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but\\nthey confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in\\nvice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose\\ndelight is in death and wretchedness? Begone! I am firm, and your\\nwords will only exasperate my rage.”\\n\\nThe monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the\\nimpotence of anger. “Shall each man,” cried he, “find a\\nwife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had\\nfeelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.\\nMan! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery,\\nand soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for\\never. Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my\\nwretchedness? You can blast my other passions, but revenge\\nremains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die, but\\nfirst you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your\\nmisery. Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful. I will watch with\\nthe wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall\\nrepent of the injuries you inflict.”\\n\\n“Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.\\nI have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend\\nbeneath words. Leave me; I am inexorable.”\\n\\n“It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your\\nwedding-night.”\\n\\nI started forward and exclaimed, “Villain! Before you sign my\\ndeath-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.”\\n\\nI would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with\\nprecipitation. In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot\\nacross the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the\\nwaves.\\n\\nAll was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned with rage to\\npursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. I\\nwalked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination\\nconjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not\\nfollowed him and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him\\nto depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. I shuddered\\nto think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.\\nAnd then I thought again of his words—“_I will be with you on\\nyour wedding-night._” That, then, was the period fixed for the\\nfulfilment of my destiny. In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and\\nextinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I\\nthought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she\\nshould find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I\\nhad shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall\\nbefore my enemy without a bitter struggle.\\n\\nThe night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became\\ncalmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into\\nthe depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last\\nnight’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I\\nalmost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow\\ncreatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I\\ndesired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,\\nbut uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to\\nbe sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a\\ndæmon whom I had myself created.\\n\\nI walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it\\nloved and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the\\nsun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep\\nsleep. I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves\\nwere agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The sleep\\ninto which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as\\nif I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to\\nreflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the\\nwords of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared\\nlike a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.\\n\\nThe sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my\\nappetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a\\nfishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;\\nit contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to\\njoin him. He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where\\nhe was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired\\nhis return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his\\nIndian enterprise. He could not any longer delay his departure; but as\\nhis journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now\\nconjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of\\nmy society on him as I could spare. He besought me, therefore, to\\nleave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed\\nsouthwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and\\nI determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.\\n\\nYet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered\\nto reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I\\nmust enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must\\nhandle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The next\\nmorning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door\\nof my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had\\ndestroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had\\nmangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself and\\nthen entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments\\nout of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my\\nwork to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly\\nput them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them\\nup, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the\\nmeantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my\\nchemical apparatus.\\n\\nNothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place\\nin my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. I had\\nbefore regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with\\nwhatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film\\nhad been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw\\nclearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur\\nto me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not\\nreflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in\\nmy own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made\\nwould be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I\\nbanished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different\\nconclusion.\\n\\nBetween two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my\\nbasket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.\\nThe scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,\\nbut I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a\\ndreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my\\nfellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was\\nsuddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of\\ndarkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound\\nas it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but\\nthe air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then\\nrising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations\\nthat I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a\\ndirect position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the\\nmoon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its\\nkeel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I\\nslept soundly.\\n\\nI do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I\\nfound that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and\\nthe waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found\\nthat the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from\\nwhich I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found\\nthat if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with\\nwater. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I\\nconfess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me\\nand was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the\\nworld that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the\\nwide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in\\nthe immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already\\nbeen out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to\\nmy other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds\\nthat flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the\\nsea; it was to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your\\ntask is already fulfilled!” I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and\\nof Clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his\\nsanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so\\ndespairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of\\nclosing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.\\n\\nSome hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the\\nhorizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became\\nfree from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick\\nand hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high\\nland towards the south.\\n\\nAlmost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured\\nfor several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of\\nwarm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.\\n\\nHow mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have\\nof life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a\\npart of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a\\nwild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived\\nthe traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself\\nsuddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I\\ncarefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at\\nlength saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of\\nextreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place\\nwhere I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with\\nme. As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good\\nharbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected\\nescape.\\n\\nAs I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several\\npeople crowded towards the spot. They seemed much surprised at my\\nappearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered\\ntogether with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me\\na slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they\\nspoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language. “My\\ngood friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of\\nthis town and inform me where I am?”\\n\\n“You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice.\\n“Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste,\\nbut you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.”\\n\\nI was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a\\nstranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and\\nangry countenances of his companions. “Why do you answer me so\\nroughly?” I replied. “Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to\\nreceive strangers so inhospitably.”\\n\\n“I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the\\nEnglish may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.”\\n\\nWhile this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly\\nincrease. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which\\nannoyed and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, but\\nno one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the\\ncrowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man\\napproaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Come, sir, you must\\nfollow me to Mr. Kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.”\\n\\n“Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not\\nthis a free country?”\\n\\n“Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate,\\nand you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was\\nfound murdered here last night.”\\n\\nThis answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent;\\nthat could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence\\nand was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from\\nfatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic\\nto rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into\\napprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that\\nwas in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair\\nall fear of ignominy or death.\\n\\nI must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of\\nthe frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my\\nrecollection.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 21\\n\\n\\nI was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old\\nbenevolent man with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however,\\nwith some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,\\nhe asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.\\n\\nAbout half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the\\nmagistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with\\nhis son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o’clock,\\nthey observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in\\nfor port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did\\nnot land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about\\ntwo miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,\\nand his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding\\nalong the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his\\nlength on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the\\nlight of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,\\nwho was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the\\ncorpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the\\nwaves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even\\nthat the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage\\nof an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it\\nto life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty\\nyears of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of\\nany violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.\\n\\nThe first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but\\nwhen the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of\\nmy brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a\\nmist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for\\nsupport. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew\\nan unfavourable augury from my manner.\\n\\nThe son confirmed his father’s account, but when Daniel Nugent was\\ncalled he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he\\nsaw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;\\nand as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same\\nboat in which I had just landed.\\n\\nA woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door\\nof her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour\\nbefore she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with\\nonly one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse\\nwas afterwards found.\\n\\nAnother woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the\\nbody into her house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed and\\nrubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was\\nquite gone.\\n\\nSeveral other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed\\nthat, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it\\nwas very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been\\nobliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.\\nBesides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body\\nfrom another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know\\nthe shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance\\nof the town of —— from the place where I had deposited the corpse.\\n\\nMr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into\\nthe room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what\\neffect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably\\nsuggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the\\nmurder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate\\nand several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the\\nstrange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,\\nknowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had\\ninhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly\\ntranquil as to the consequences of the affair.\\n\\nI entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. How\\ncan I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with\\nhorror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and\\nagony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,\\npassed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry\\nClerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on\\nthe body, I exclaimed, “Have my murderous machinations deprived you\\nalso, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other\\nvictims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my\\nbenefactor—”\\n\\nThe human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and\\nI was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.\\n\\nA fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; my\\nravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the\\nmurderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my\\nattendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was\\ntormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping\\nmy neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke\\nmy native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and\\nbitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.\\n\\nWhy did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not\\nsink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming\\nchildren, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and\\nyouthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the\\nnext a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I\\nmade that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of\\nthe wheel, continually renewed the torture?\\n\\nBut I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from\\na dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by\\ngaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.\\nIt was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had\\nforgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some\\ngreat misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around\\nand saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I\\nwas, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.\\n\\nThis sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside\\nme. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her\\ncountenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise\\nthat class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of\\npersons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her\\ntone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,\\nand the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.\\n\\n“Are you better now, sir?” said she.\\n\\nI replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am;\\nbut if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am\\nstill alive to feel this misery and horror.”\\n\\n“For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the\\ngentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you\\nwere dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, that’s none\\nof my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty\\nwith a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.”\\n\\nI turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a\\nspeech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt\\nlanguid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series\\nof my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it\\nwere all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force\\nof reality.\\n\\nAs the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew\\nfeverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed\\nme with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. The\\nphysician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared\\nthem for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the\\nexpression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the\\nsecond. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the\\nhangman who would gain his fee?\\n\\nThese were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had\\nshown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison\\nto be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who\\nhad provided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to\\nsee me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of\\nevery human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and\\nmiserable ravings of a murderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to see\\nthat I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long\\nintervals.\\n\\nOne day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes\\nhalf open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom\\nand misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to\\nremain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I\\nconsidered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the\\npenalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my\\nthoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.\\nHis countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to\\nmine and addressed me in French,\\n\\n“I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to\\nmake you more comfortable?”\\n\\n“I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole\\nearth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.”\\n\\n“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to\\none borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I\\nhope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can\\neasily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.”\\n\\n“That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become\\nthe most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and\\nhave been, can death be any evil to me?”\\n\\n“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the\\nstrange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some\\nsurprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,\\nseized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was\\npresented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so\\nunaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across\\nyour path.”\\n\\nAs Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on\\nthis retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at\\nthe knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some\\nastonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened\\nto say,\\n\\n“Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on\\nyour person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some\\ntrace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune\\nand illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I\\ndiscovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote\\nto Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.\\nBut you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any\\nkind.”\\n\\n“This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;\\ntell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am\\nnow to lament?”\\n\\n“Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr. Kirwin with\\ngentleness; “and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.”\\n\\nI know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it\\ninstantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my\\nmisery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for\\nme to comply with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes,\\nand cried out in agony,\\n\\n“Oh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not\\nlet him enter!”\\n\\nMr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help\\nregarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in\\nrather a severe tone,\\n\\n“I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father\\nwould have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”\\n\\n“My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed\\nfrom anguish to pleasure. “Is my father indeed come? How kind, how\\nvery kind! But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?”\\n\\nMy change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he\\nthought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,\\nand now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose and\\nquitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.\\n\\nNothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the\\narrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him and cried,\\n\\n“Are you then safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?”\\n\\nMy father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by\\ndwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my\\ndesponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of\\ncheerfulness. “What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!”\\nsaid he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance\\nof the room. “You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems\\nto pursue you. And poor Clerval—”\\n\\nThe name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too\\ngreat to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.\\n\\n“Alas! Yes, my father,” replied I; “some destiny of the\\nmost horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I\\nshould have died on the coffin of Henry.”\\n\\nWe were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the\\nprecarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that\\ncould ensure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my\\nstrength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But the\\nappearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I\\ngradually recovered my health.\\n\\nAs my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black\\nmelancholy that nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was\\nfor ever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation\\ninto which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous\\nrelapse. Alas! Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a\\nlife? It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now\\ndrawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these\\nthrobbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears\\nme to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also\\nsink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant, although the\\nwish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours\\nmotionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that\\nmight bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.\\n\\nThe season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months\\nin prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a\\nrelapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country\\ntown where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every\\ncare of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. I was spared\\nthe disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not\\nbrought before the court that decides on life and death. The grand\\njury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney\\nIslands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight\\nafter my removal I was liberated from prison.\\n\\nMy father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a\\ncriminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh\\natmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. I did not\\nparticipate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a\\npalace were alike hateful. The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and\\nalthough the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I\\nsaw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by\\nno light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. Sometimes\\nthey were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark\\norbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed\\nthem; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I\\nfirst saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.\\n\\nMy father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked\\nof Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but\\nthese words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a\\nwish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved\\ncousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more\\nthe blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early\\nchildhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a\\nprison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and\\nthese fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and\\ndespair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the\\nexistence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance\\nto restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.\\n\\nYet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally\\ntriumphed over my selfish despair. It was necessary that I should\\nreturn without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those\\nI so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any\\nchance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to\\nblast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to\\nthe existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the\\nmockery of a soul still more monstrous. My father still desired to\\ndelay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a\\njourney, for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being. My\\nstrength was gone. I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day\\npreyed upon my wasted frame.\\n\\nStill, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience,\\nmy father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel\\nbound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.\\nIt was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to\\nthe dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my\\nsight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should\\nsoon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;\\nyet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested\\nshore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly\\nthat I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest\\ncompanion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I\\nrepassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing\\nwith my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for\\nIngolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on\\nto the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in\\nwhich he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a\\nthousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.\\n\\nEver since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of taking\\nevery night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug\\nonly that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of\\nlife. Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now\\nswallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did\\nnot afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a\\nthousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind\\nof nightmare; I felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and could not free\\nmyself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who was\\nwatching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves\\nwere around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of\\nsecurity, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour\\nand the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm\\nforgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly\\nsusceptible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 22\\n\\n\\nThe voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon\\nfound that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I\\ncould continue my journey. My father’s care and attentions were\\nindefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and\\nsought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to\\nseek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not\\nabhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt\\nattracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an\\nangelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right\\nto share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whose\\njoy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. How they\\nwould, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know\\nmy unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!\\n\\nMy father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by\\nvarious arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he thought that I\\nfelt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of\\nmurder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.\\n\\n“Alas! My father,” said I, “how little do you know me. \\nHuman beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such\\na wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent\\nas I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause\\nof this—I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry—they all\\ndied by my hands.”\\n\\nMy father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same\\nassertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an\\nexplanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of\\ndelirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented\\nitself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my\\nconvalescence. I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence\\nconcerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that I should be\\nsupposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue. But,\\nbesides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my\\nhearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of\\nhis breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was\\nsilent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.\\nYet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably\\nfrom me. I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part\\nrelieved the burden of my mysterious woe.\\n\\nUpon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder,\\n“My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreat\\nyou never to make such an assertion again.”\\n\\n“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who\\nhave viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the\\nassassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.\\nA thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have\\nsaved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not\\nsacrifice the whole human race.”\\n\\nThe conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were\\nderanged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and\\nendeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. He wished as much as\\npossible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in\\nIreland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my\\nmisfortunes.\\n\\nAs time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my\\nheart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own\\ncrimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. By the utmost\\nself-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which\\nsometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners\\nwere calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey\\nto the sea of ice.\\n\\nA few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the\\nfollowing letter from Elizabeth:\\n\\n“My dear Friend,\\n\\n“It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle\\ndated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may\\nhope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor cousin, how much you\\nmust have suffered! I expect to see you looking even more ill than\\nwhen you quitted Geneva. This winter has been passed most miserably,\\ntortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in\\nyour countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of\\ncomfort and tranquillity.\\n\\n“Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable\\na year ago, even perhaps augmented by time. I would not disturb you at\\nthis period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a\\nconversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders\\nsome explanation necessary before we meet.\\n\\nExplanation! You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain? If\\nyou really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.\\nBut you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet\\nbe pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the\\ncase, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I\\nhave often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.\\n\\n“You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of\\nyour parents ever since our infancy. We were told this when young, and\\ntaught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take\\nplace. We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I\\nbelieve, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. But\\nas brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each\\nother without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our\\ncase? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual\\nhappiness, with simple truth—Do you not love another?\\n\\n“You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at\\nIngolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last\\nautumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every\\ncreature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our\\nconnection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of\\nyour parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.\\nBut this is false reasoning. I confess to you, my friend, that I love\\nyou and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant\\nfriend and companion. But it is your happiness I desire as well as my\\nown when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally\\nmiserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice. Even now\\nI weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest\\nmisfortunes, you may stifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of that\\nlove and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. I, who\\nhave so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries\\ntenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes. Ah! Victor, be assured\\nthat your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be\\nmade miserable by this supposition. Be happy, my friend; and if you\\nobey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth\\nwill have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.\\n\\n“Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the\\nnext day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain. My uncle\\nwill send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your\\nlips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I\\nshall need no other happiness.\\n\\n“Elizabeth Lavenza.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Geneva, May 18th, 17—”\\n\\n\\n\\nThis letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of\\nthe fiend—“_I will be with you on your\\nwedding-night!_” Such was my sentence, and on that night would the\\ndæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of\\nhappiness which promised partly to console my sufferings. On that night he\\nhad determined to consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a\\ndeadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were\\nvictorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. If he\\nwere vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas! What freedom? Such as the\\npeasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his\\ncottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless,\\npenniless, and alone, but free. Such would be my liberty except that in my\\nElizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of\\nremorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.\\n\\nSweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and reread her letter, and some\\nsoftened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal\\ndreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the\\nangel’s arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make\\nher happy. If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet,\\nagain, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My\\ndestruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer\\nshould suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would\\nsurely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed\\n_to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider that\\nthreat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that\\nhe was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately\\nafter the enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my\\nimmediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my\\nfather’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against my life\\nshould not retard it a single hour.\\n\\nIn this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and\\naffectionate. “I fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little happiness\\nremains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in\\nyou. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life\\nand my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a\\ndreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with\\nhorror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only\\nwonder that I survive what I have endured. I will confide this tale of\\nmisery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place,\\nfor, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us. But\\nuntil then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it. This I most\\nearnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.”\\n\\nIn about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s letter we returned\\nto Geneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were\\nin her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a\\nchange in her also. She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly\\nvivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of\\ncompassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I\\nwas.\\n\\nThe tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought madness\\nwith it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed\\nme; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and\\ndespondent. I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless,\\nbewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.\\n\\nElizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice\\nwould soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human\\nfeelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me and for me. When reason\\nreturned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with\\nresignation. Ah! It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the\\nguilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is\\notherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.\\n\\nSoon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with\\nElizabeth. I remained silent.\\n\\n“Have you, then, some other attachment?”\\n\\n“None on earth. I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with\\ndelight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate\\nmyself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.”\\n\\n“My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen\\nus, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love\\nfor those whom we have lost to those who yet live. Our circle will be\\nsmall but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.\\nAnd when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of\\ncare will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly\\ndeprived.”\\n\\nSuch were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the\\nthreat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had\\nyet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as\\ninvincible, and that when he had pronounced the words “_I shall be with\\nyou on your wedding-night_,” I should regard the threatened fate as\\nunavoidable. But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were\\nbalanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful\\ncountenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the\\nceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined,\\nthe seal to my fate.\\n\\nGreat God! If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish\\nintention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself\\nfor ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over\\nthe earth than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if\\npossessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real\\nintentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I\\nhastened that of a far dearer victim.\\n\\nAs the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or\\na prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my\\nfeelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the\\ncountenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer\\neye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with placid contentment,\\nnot unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed,\\nthat what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate\\ninto an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.\\n\\nPreparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received,\\nand all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own\\nheart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness\\ninto the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the\\ndecorations of my tragedy. Through my father’s exertions a part of\\nthe inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian\\ngovernment. A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. It\\nwas agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa\\nLavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake\\nnear which it stood.\\n\\nIn the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the\\nfiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger\\nconstantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and\\nby these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the\\nperiod approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be\\nregarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for\\nin my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed\\nfor its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of\\nas an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.\\n\\nElizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to\\ncalm her mind. But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my\\ndestiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;\\nand perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had\\npromised to reveal to her on the following day. My father was in the\\nmeantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in\\nthe melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.\\n\\nAfter the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my\\nfather’s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our\\njourney by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our\\nvoyage on the following day. The day was fair, the wind favourable;\\nall smiled on our nuptial embarkation.\\n\\nThose were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the\\nfeeling of happiness. We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we\\nwere sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the\\nbeauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw\\nMont Salêve, the pleasant banks of Montalègre, and at a distance,\\nsurmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy\\nmountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the\\nopposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the\\nambition that would quit its native country, and an almost\\ninsurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.\\n\\nI took the hand of Elizabeth. “You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! If\\nyou knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would\\nendeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this\\none day at least permits me to enjoy.”\\n\\n“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “there is, I hope,\\nnothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not\\npainted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to me\\nnot to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I\\nwill not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move\\nalong and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise\\nabove the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more\\ninteresting. Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in\\nthe clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at\\nthe bottom. What a divine day! How happy and serene all nature\\nappears!”\\n\\nThus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all\\nreflection upon melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating;\\njoy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place\\nto distraction and reverie.\\n\\nThe sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and\\nobserved its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the\\nlower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached\\nthe amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. The\\nspire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range\\nof mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.\\n\\nThe wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,\\nsank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water\\nand caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the\\nshore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and\\nhay. The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched\\nthe shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp\\nme and cling to me for ever.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 23\\n\\n\\nIt was eight o’clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the\\nshore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and\\ncontemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured\\nin darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.\\n\\nThe wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence\\nin the west. The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was\\nbeginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the\\nflight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the\\nscene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves\\nthat were beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.\\n\\nI had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the\\nshapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious\\nand watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in\\nmy bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my\\nlife dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that\\nof my adversary was extinguished.\\n\\nElizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence,\\nbut there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and\\ntrembling, she asked, “What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?\\nWhat is it you fear?”\\n\\n“Oh! Peace, peace, my love,” replied I; “this night, and\\nall will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.”\\n\\nI passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how\\nfearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife,\\nand I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her\\nuntil I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.\\n\\nShe left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages\\nof the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to\\nmy adversary. But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to\\nconjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the\\nexecution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful\\nscream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I\\nheard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the\\nmotion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood\\ntrickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This\\nstate lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed\\ninto the room.\\n\\nGreat God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the\\ndestruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She was\\nthere, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down\\nand her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I\\nturn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung\\nby the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and live? Alas!\\nLife is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment\\nonly did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.\\n\\nWhen I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their\\ncountenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others\\nappeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I\\nescaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my\\nwife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the\\nposture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon\\nher arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have\\nsupposed her asleep. I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but\\nthe deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held\\nin my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.\\nThe murderous mark of the fiend’s grasp was on her neck, and the\\nbreath had ceased to issue from her lips.\\n\\nWhile I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.\\nThe windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of\\npanic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.\\nThe shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be\\ndescribed, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.\\nA grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his\\nfiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards\\nthe window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,\\nleaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning,\\nplunged into the lake.\\n\\nThe report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to\\nthe spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with\\nboats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we\\nreturned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a\\nform conjured up by my fancy. After having landed, they proceeded to\\nsearch the country, parties going in different directions among the\\nwoods and vines.\\n\\nI attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the\\nhouse, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken\\nman, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my\\neyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I\\nwas carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had\\nhappened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that\\nI had lost.\\n\\nAfter an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room\\nwhere the corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around; I\\nhung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no\\ndistinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to\\nvarious subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their\\ncause. I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death\\nof William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly\\nof my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining\\nfriends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now\\nmight be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his\\nfeet. This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. I started\\nup and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.\\n\\nThere were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the\\nwind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was\\nhardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men\\nto row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from\\nmental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt,\\nand the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any\\nexertion. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way\\nto every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were\\nfamiliar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day\\nbefore in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.\\nTears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw\\nthe fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had\\nthen been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as\\na great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower,\\nbut nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had\\nsnatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been\\nso miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of\\nman.\\n\\nBut why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last\\noverwhelming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their\\n_acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know\\nthat, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My\\nown strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of\\nmy hideous narration.\\n\\nI arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk\\nunder the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old\\nman! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their\\ndelight—his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with\\nall that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having\\nfew affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed\\nbe the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste\\nin wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated\\naround him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to\\nrise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.\\n\\nWhat then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and\\ndarkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes,\\nindeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales\\nwith the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a\\ndungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear\\nconception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my\\nprison. For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I\\nunderstood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.\\n\\nLiberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I\\nawakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the\\nmemory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their\\ncause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable dæmon whom I had\\nsent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a\\nmaddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed\\nthat I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal\\nrevenge on his cursed head.\\n\\nNor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to\\nreflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about\\na month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town\\nand told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the\\ndestroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole\\nauthority for the apprehension of the murderer.\\n\\nThe magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. “Be\\nassured, sir,” said he, “no pains or exertions on my part shall\\nbe spared to discover the villain.”\\n\\n“I thank you,” replied I; “listen, therefore, to the\\ndeposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I\\nshould fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth\\nwhich, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to\\nbe mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.” My\\nmanner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my\\nown heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose\\nquieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related\\nmy history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with\\naccuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.\\n\\nThe magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued\\nhe became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with\\nhorror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted\\non his countenance.\\n\\nWhen I had concluded my narration, I said, “This is the being whom I\\naccuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your\\nwhole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that\\nyour feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those\\nfunctions on this occasion.”\\n\\nThis address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own\\nauditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given\\nto a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon\\nto act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity\\nreturned. He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly afford you\\nevery aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to\\nhave powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an\\nanimal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where\\nno man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since\\nthe commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he\\nhas wandered or what region he may now inhabit.”\\n\\n“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if\\nhe has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois\\nand destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not\\ncredit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the\\npunishment which is his desert.”\\n\\nAs I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.\\n“You are mistaken,” said he. “I will exert myself, and if\\nit is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer\\npunishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have\\nyourself described to be his properties, that this will prove\\nimpracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should\\nmake up your mind to disappointment.”\\n\\n“That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My\\nrevenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I\\nconfess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage\\nis unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned\\nloose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand; I have\\nbut one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to\\nhis destruction.”\\n\\nI trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy\\nin my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness\\nwhich the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan\\nmagistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of\\ndevotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of\\nmadness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and\\nreverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.\\n\\n“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of\\nwisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say.”\\n\\nI broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on\\nsome other mode of action.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 24\\n\\n\\nMy present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was\\nswallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone\\nendowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and\\nallowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise\\ndelirium or death would have been my portion.\\n\\nMy first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I\\nwas happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became\\nhateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels\\nwhich had belonged to my mother, and departed.\\n\\nAnd now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I have\\ntraversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships\\nwhich travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How I\\nhave lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon\\nthe sandy plain and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared\\nnot die and leave my adversary in being.\\n\\nWhen I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I\\nmight trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled,\\nand I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain\\nwhat path I should pursue. As night approached I found myself at the\\nentrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father\\nreposed. I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their\\ngraves. Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which\\nwere gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the\\nscene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested\\nobserver. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to\\ncast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the\\nmourner.\\n\\nThe deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to\\nrage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived,\\nand to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass\\nand kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the\\nsacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the\\ndeep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the\\nspirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery,\\nuntil he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will\\npreserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun\\nand tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my\\neyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering\\nministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed\\nand hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now\\ntorments me.”\\n\\nI had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me\\nthat the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but\\nthe furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.\\n\\nI was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish\\nlaugh. It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed\\nit, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.\\nSurely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have\\ndestroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I\\nwas reserved for vengeance. The laughter died away, when a well-known\\nand abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an\\naudible whisper, “I am satisfied, miserable wretch! You have\\ndetermined to live, and I am satisfied.”\\n\\nI darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil\\neluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone\\nfull upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than\\nmortal speed.\\n\\nI pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a\\nslight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. The\\nblue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend\\nenter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I\\ntook my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.\\n\\nAmidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I\\nhave ever followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by\\nthis horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,\\nwho feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,\\nleft some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw\\nthe print of his huge step on the white plain. To you first entering\\non life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand\\nwhat I have felt and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue were the\\nleast pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil\\nand carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good\\nfollowed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly\\nextricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes,\\nwhen nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast\\nwas prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. The\\nfare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but\\nI will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had\\ninvoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and\\nI was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the\\nfew drops that revived me, and vanish.\\n\\nI followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dæmon\\ngenerally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the\\ncountry chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom\\nseen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my\\npath. I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers\\nby distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed,\\nwhich, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had\\nprovided me with fire and utensils for cooking.\\n\\nMy life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during\\nsleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most\\nmiserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The\\nspirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of\\nhappiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of\\nthis respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was\\nsustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my\\nfriends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent\\ncountenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’s\\nvoice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by\\na toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should\\ncome and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest\\nfriends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling to\\ntheir dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and\\npersuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that\\nburned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the\\ndestruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the\\nmechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the\\nardent desire of my soul.\\n\\nWhat his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he\\nleft marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided\\nme and instigated my fury. “My reign is not yet\\nover”—these words were legible in one of these\\ninscriptions—“you live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I\\nseek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of\\ncold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, if\\nyou follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. Come on, my\\nenemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable\\nhours must you endure until that period shall arrive.”\\n\\nScoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee,\\nmiserable fiend, to torture and death. Never will I give up my search\\nuntil he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my\\nElizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the\\nreward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!\\n\\nAs I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the\\ncold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants were\\nshut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to\\nseize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to\\nseek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be\\nprocured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.\\n\\nThe triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One\\ninscription that he left was in these words: “Prepare! Your toils\\nonly begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter\\nupon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting\\nhatred.”\\n\\nMy courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I\\nresolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support\\nme, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,\\nuntil the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary\\nof the horizon. Oh! How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the\\nsouth! Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by\\nits superior wildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when\\nthey beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with\\nrapture the boundary of their toils. I did not weep, but I knelt down\\nand with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in\\nsafety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary’s gibe,\\nto meet and grapple with him.\\n\\nSome weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus\\ntraversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the\\nfiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had\\ndaily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that\\nwhen I first saw the ocean he was but one day’s journey in advance, and\\nI hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. With new\\ncourage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched\\nhamlet on the seashore. I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the\\nfiend and gained accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said,\\nhad arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols,\\nputting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of\\nhis terrific appearance. He had carried off their store of winter\\nfood, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a\\nnumerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same\\nnight, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his\\njourney across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they\\nconjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the\\nice or frozen by the eternal frosts.\\n\\nOn hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.\\nHe had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless\\njourney across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few\\nof the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a\\ngenial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the idea\\nthat the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance\\nreturned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.\\nAfter a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered\\nround and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.\\n\\nI exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of\\nthe Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I\\ndeparted from land.\\n\\nI cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured\\nmisery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution\\nburning within my heart could have enabled me to support. Immense and\\nrugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard\\nthe thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction. But\\nagain the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.\\n\\nBy the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that\\nI had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction\\nof hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of\\ndespondency and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured\\nher prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after\\nthe poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the\\nsummit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,\\ndied, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye\\ncaught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to\\ndiscover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I\\ndistinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known\\nform within. Oh! With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!\\nWarm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might\\nnot intercept the view I had of the dæmon; but still my sight was\\ndimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that\\noppressed me, I wept aloud.\\n\\nBut this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their\\ndead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an\\nhour’s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly\\nirksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge was still visible, nor\\ndid I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short\\ntime some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed\\nperceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days’ journey, I\\nbeheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within\\nme.\\n\\nBut now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were\\nsuddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had\\never done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as\\nthe waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous\\nand terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared;\\nand, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a\\ntremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a few\\nminutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left\\ndrifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and\\nthus preparing for me a hideous death.\\n\\nIn this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I\\nmyself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your\\nvessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.\\nI had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded\\nat the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and\\nby these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in\\nthe direction of your ship. I had determined, if you were going southwards,\\nstill to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my\\npurpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue\\nmy enemy. But your direction was northwards. You took me on board when my\\nvigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied\\nhardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.\\n\\nOh! When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the dæmon, allow\\nme the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live? If I do,\\nswear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him\\nand satisfy my vengeance in his death. And do I dare to ask of you to\\nundertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?\\nNo; I am not so selfish. Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if\\nthe ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he\\nshall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated\\nwoes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes. He is eloquent\\nand persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but\\ntrust him not. His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery\\nand fiend-like malice. Hear him not; call on the names of William,\\nJustine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and\\nthrust your sword into his heart. I will hover near and direct the\\nsteel aright.\\n\\nWalton, _in continuation._\\n\\n\\nAugust 26th, 17—.\\n\\n\\nYou have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not\\nfeel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles\\nmine? Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his\\ntale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with\\ndifficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes\\nwere now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow\\nand quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his\\ncountenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a\\ntranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a\\nvolcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression\\nof the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.\\n\\nHis tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth,\\nyet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me,\\nand the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a\\ngreater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations,\\nhowever earnest and connected. Such a monster has, then, really existence!\\nI cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I\\nendeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his\\ncreature’s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.\\n\\n“Are you mad, my friend?” said he. “Or whither does your\\nsenseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the\\nworld a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do not seek\\nto increase your own.”\\n\\nFrankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked\\nto see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places,\\nbut principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held\\nwith his enemy. “Since you have preserved my narration,” said\\nhe, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down to\\nposterity.”\\n\\nThus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest\\ntale that ever imagination formed. My thoughts and every feeling of my\\nsoul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale\\nand his own elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe\\nhim, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of\\nevery hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! The only joy that he can\\nnow know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and\\ndeath. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and\\ndelirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his\\nfriends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or\\nexcitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his\\nfancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a\\nremote world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render\\nthem to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.\\n\\nOur conversations are not always confined to his own history and\\nmisfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays\\nunbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. His\\neloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates\\na pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love,\\nwithout tears. What a glorious creature must he have been in the days\\nof his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! He seems\\nto feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.\\n\\n“When younger,” said he, “I believed myself destined for\\nsome great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness\\nof judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of\\nthe worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed,\\nfor I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that\\nmight be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the work I had\\ncompleted, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational\\nanimal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But\\nthis thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now\\nserves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes\\nare as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am\\nchained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of\\nanalysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I\\nconceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot\\nrecollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod\\nheaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea\\nof their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty\\nambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once\\nwas, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation. Despondency\\nrarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,\\nnever, never again to rise.”\\n\\nMust I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have\\nsought one who would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desert\\nseas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his\\nvalue and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.\\n\\n“I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind intentions towards so\\nmiserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh\\naffections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any\\nman be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth? Even\\nwhere the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,\\nthe companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our\\nminds which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our\\ninfantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified,\\nare never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more\\ncertain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a\\nbrother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early,\\nsuspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend,\\nhowever strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be\\ncontemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only\\nthrough habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever\\nI am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of\\nClerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one\\nfeeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I\\nwere engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive\\nutility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But\\nsuch is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I\\ngave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.”\\n\\nMy beloved Sister,\\n\\nSeptember 2d.\\n\\n\\nI write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever\\ndoomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit\\nit. I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and\\nthreaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows whom I\\nhave persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have\\nnone to bestow. There is something terribly appalling in our\\nsituation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. Yet it is\\nterrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered\\nthrough me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.\\n\\nAnd what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my\\ndestruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and\\nyou will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! My\\nbeloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is,\\nin prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you have a husband\\nand lovely children; you may be happy. Heaven bless you and make you so!\\n\\nMy unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. He\\nendeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession\\nwhich he valued. He reminds me how often the same accidents have\\nhappened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite\\nof myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel\\nthe power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he\\nrouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these\\nvast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the\\nresolutions of man. These feelings are transitory; each day of\\nexpectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny\\ncaused by this despair.\\n\\nSeptember 5th.\\n\\n\\nA scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is\\nhighly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot\\nforbear recording it.\\n\\nWe are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger\\nof being crushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of\\nmy unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of\\ndesolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire\\nstill glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly\\nroused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent\\nlifelessness.\\n\\nI mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny.\\nThis morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his\\neyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly—I was roused by half\\na dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. They\\nentered, and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his\\ncompanions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation\\nto me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse.\\nWe were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they\\nfeared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free\\npassage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and\\nlead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted\\nthis. They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn\\npromise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my\\ncourse southwards.\\n\\nThis speech troubled me. I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived\\nthe idea of returning if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even in\\npossibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered, when\\nFrankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly\\nto have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled,\\nand his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men,\\nhe said,\\n\\n“What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then,\\nso easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious\\nexpedition? “And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was\\nsmooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and\\nterror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth\\nand your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and\\nthese you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this\\nwas it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the\\nbenefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men\\nwho encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And now,\\nbehold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first\\nmighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content\\nto be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and\\nperil; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm\\nfiresides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come\\nthus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove\\nyourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your\\npurposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your\\nhearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it\\nshall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace\\nmarked on your brows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and\\nwho know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.”\\n\\nHe spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed\\nin his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can\\nyou wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another and were\\nunable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had\\nbeen said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously\\ndesired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage\\nwould return.\\n\\nThey retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and\\nalmost deprived of life.\\n\\nHow all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than\\nreturn shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my\\nfate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never\\nwillingly continue to endure their present hardships.\\n\\nSeptember 7th.\\n\\n\\nThe die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed.\\nThus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back\\nignorant and disappointed. It requires more philosophy than I possess\\nto bear this injustice with patience.\\n\\nSeptember 12th.\\n\\n\\nIt is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility\\nand glory; I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these\\nbitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted\\ntowards England and towards you, I will not despond.\\n\\nSeptember 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard\\nat a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We were\\nin the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief\\nattention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in\\nsuch a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked\\nbehind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from\\nthe west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly\\nfree. When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native\\ncountry was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them,\\nloud and long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the\\ncause of the tumult. “They shout,” I said, “because they\\nwill soon return to England.”\\n\\n“Do you, then, really return?”\\n\\n“Alas! Yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them\\nunwillingly to danger, and I must return.”\\n\\n“Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your purpose, but\\nmine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not. I am weak, but\\nsurely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with\\nsufficient strength.” Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the\\nbed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.\\n\\nIt was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was\\nentirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with\\ndifficulty and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing\\ndraught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the meantime he\\ntold me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.\\n\\nHis sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient. I sat\\nby his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but\\npresently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near,\\nsaid, “Alas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall\\nsoon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think\\nnot, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning\\nhatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself\\njustified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I\\nhave been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.\\nIn a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was\\nbound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and\\nwell-being. This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to\\nthat. My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to\\nmy attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or\\nmisery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to\\ncreate a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity\\nand selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction\\nbeings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I\\nknow where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may\\nrender no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was\\nmine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I\\nasked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now,\\nwhen I am only induced by reason and virtue.\\n\\n“Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil\\nthis task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have\\nlittle chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of these\\npoints, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I\\nleave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near\\napproach of death. I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I\\nmay still be misled by passion.\\n\\n“That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in\\nother respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the\\nonly happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms of\\nthe beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell,\\nWalton! Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it\\nbe only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in\\nscience and discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have myself been\\nblasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.”\\n\\nHis voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his\\neffort, he sank into silence. About half an hour afterwards he\\nattempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and\\nhis eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed\\naway from his lips.\\n\\nMargaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this\\nglorious spirit? What can I say that will enable you to understand the\\ndepth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate and\\nfeeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of\\ndisappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there find\\nconsolation.\\n\\nI am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the\\nbreeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again there\\nis a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin\\nwhere the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise and examine.\\nGood night, my sister.\\n\\nGreat God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the\\nremembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail\\nit; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this\\nfinal and wonderful catastrophe.\\n\\nI entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable\\nfriend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to\\ndescribe—gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its\\nproportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long\\nlocks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and\\napparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my\\napproach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung\\ntowards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of\\nsuch loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and\\nendeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.\\nI called on him to stay.\\n\\nHe paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the\\nlifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and\\nevery feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some\\nuncontrollable passion.\\n\\n“That is also my victim!” he exclaimed. “In his murder my\\ncrimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its\\nclose! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it\\navail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee\\nby destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer\\nme.”\\n\\nHis voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to\\nme the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his\\nenemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I\\napproached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his\\nface, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I\\nattempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster\\ncontinued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I\\ngathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.\\n\\n“Your repentance,” I said, “is now superfluous. If you\\nhad listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse\\nbefore you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity,\\nFrankenstein would yet have lived.”\\n\\n“And do you dream?” said the dæmon. “Do you think that I was then\\ndead to agony and remorse? He,” he continued, pointing to the corpse,\\n“he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh! Not the\\nten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the\\nlingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me\\non, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you that the\\ngroans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to be\\nsusceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice\\nand hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without\\ntorture such as you cannot even imagine.\\n\\n“After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken\\nand overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I\\nabhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of\\nmy existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for\\nhappiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me\\nhe sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the\\nindulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter\\nindignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I\\nrecollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished. I\\nknew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the\\nslave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not\\ndisobey. Yet when she died! Nay, then I was not miserable. I had\\ncast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my\\ndespair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no\\nchoice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly\\nchosen. The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable\\npassion. And now it is ended; there is my last victim!”\\n\\nI was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called\\nto mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and\\npersuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my\\nfriend, indignation was rekindled within me. “Wretch!” I said.\\n“It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you\\nhave made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are\\nconsumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend!\\nIf he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would\\nhe become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you\\nfeel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn\\nfrom your power.”\\n\\n“Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being.\\n“Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to\\nbe the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.\\nNo sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of\\nvirtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being\\noverflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has\\nbecome to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into\\nbitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am\\ncontent to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am\\nwell satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once\\nmy fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once\\nI falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would\\nlove me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was\\nnourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has\\ndegraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no\\nmalignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the\\nfrightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same\\ncreature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent\\nvisions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the\\nfallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man\\nhad friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.\\n\\n“You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my\\ncrimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them\\nhe could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured\\nwasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did\\nnot satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still\\nI desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no\\ninjustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all\\nhumankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his\\nfriend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic\\nwho sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous\\nand immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an\\nabortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my\\nblood boils at the recollection of this injustice.\\n\\n“But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and\\nthe helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to\\ndeath his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have\\ndevoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and\\nadmiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that\\nirremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but\\nyour abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the\\nhands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the\\nimagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands\\nwill meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.\\n\\n“Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work\\nis nearly complete. Neither yours nor any man’s death is needed to\\nconsummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done,\\nbut it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this\\nsacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me\\nthither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall\\ncollect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its\\nremains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would\\ncreate such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the\\nagonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet\\nunquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no\\nmore, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no\\nlonger see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light,\\nfeeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my\\nhappiness. Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first\\nopened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the\\nrustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to\\nme, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by\\ncrimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in\\ndeath?\\n\\n“Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these\\neyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive\\nand yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better\\nsatiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou\\ndidst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness;\\nand if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think\\nand feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than\\nthat which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to\\nthine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my\\nwounds until death shall close them for ever.\\n\\n“But soon,” he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, “I\\nshall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning\\nmiseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and\\nexult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration\\nwill fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit\\nwill sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.\\nFarewell.”\\n\\nHe sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft\\nwhich lay close to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves and\\nlost in darkness and distance.\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 84 ***\"}\n",

A VOYAGE TO THE COUNTRY OF THE HOUYHNHNMS.\\n\\n\\nTHE PUBLISHER TO THE READER.\\n\\n[_As given in the original edition_.]\\n\\n\\nThe author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient and\\nintimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us on the\\nmother’s side. About three years ago, Mr. Gulliver growing weary of the\\nconcourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff, made\\na small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark, in\\nNottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet in\\ngood esteem among his neighbours.\\n\\nAlthough Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his father\\ndwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from Oxfordshire; to\\nconfirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at Banbury in that\\ncounty, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.\\n\\nBefore he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following papers\\nin my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should think fit.\\nI have carefully perused them three times. The style is very plain and\\nsimple; and the only fault I find is, that the author, after the manner\\nof travellers, is a little too circumstantial. There is an air of truth\\napparent through the whole; and indeed the author was so distinguished\\nfor his veracity, that it became a sort of proverb among his neighbours\\nat Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing, to say, it was as true as if\\nMr. Gulliver had spoken it.\\n\\nBy the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the author’s\\npermission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to send them\\ninto the world, hoping they may be, at least for some time, a better\\nentertainment to our young noblemen, than the common scribbles of\\npolitics and party.\\n\\nThis volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not made\\nbold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and\\ntides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several\\nvoyages, together with the minute descriptions of the management of the\\nship in storms, in the style of sailors; likewise the account of\\nlongitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend, that Mr.\\nGulliver may be a little dissatisfied. But I was resolved to fit the\\nwork as much as possible to the general capacity of readers. However,\\nif my own ignorance in sea affairs shall have led me to commit some\\nmistakes, I alone am answerable for them. And if any traveller hath a\\ncuriosity to see the whole work at large, as it came from the hands of\\nthe author, I will be ready to gratify him.\\n\\nAs for any further particulars relating to the author, the reader will\\nreceive satisfaction from the first pages of the book.\\n\\n\\n                                                     RICHARD SYMPSON.\\n\\n\\nA LETTER FROM CAPTAIN GULLIVER TO HIS COUSIN SYMPSON.\\n\\nWritten in the Year 1727.\\n\\nI hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be called\\nto it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on me to\\npublish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels, with\\ndirections to hire some young gentleman of either university to put\\nthem in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did, by my\\nadvice, in his book called “A Voyage round the world.” But I do not\\nremember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,\\nand much less that any thing should be inserted; therefore, as to the\\nlatter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind; particularly a\\nparagraph about her majesty Queen Anne, of most pious and glorious\\nmemory; although I did reverence and esteem her more than any of human\\nspecies. But you, or your interpolator, ought to have considered, that\\nit was not my inclination, so was it not decent to praise any animal of\\nour composition before my master _Houyhnhnm_: And besides, the fact was\\naltogether false; for to my knowledge, being in England during some\\npart of her majesty’s reign, she did govern by a chief minister; nay\\neven by two successively, the first whereof was the lord of Godolphin,\\nand the second the lord of Oxford; so that you have made me say the\\nthing that was not. Likewise in the account of the academy of\\nprojectors, and several passages of my discourse to my master\\n_Houyhnhnm_, you have either omitted some material circumstances, or\\nminced or changed them in such a manner, that I do hardly know my own\\nwork. When I formerly hinted to you something of this in a letter, you\\nwere pleased to answer that you were afraid of giving offence; that\\npeople in power were very watchful over the press, and apt not only to\\ninterpret, but to punish every thing which looked like an _innuendo_\\n(as I think you call it). But, pray how could that which I spoke so\\nmany years ago, and at about five thousand leagues distance, in another\\nreign, be applied to any of the _Yahoos_, who now are said to govern\\nthe herd; especially at a time when I little thought, or feared, the\\nunhappiness of living under them? Have not I the most reason to\\ncomplain, when I see these very _Yahoos_ carried by _Houyhnhnms_ in a\\nvehicle, as if they were brutes, and those the rational creatures? And\\nindeed to avoid so monstrous and detestable a sight was one principal\\nmotive of my retirement hither.\\n\\nThus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself, and to\\nthe trust I reposed in you.\\n\\nI do, in the next place, complain of my own great want of judgment, in\\nbeing prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasoning of you and\\nsome others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my travels to\\nbe published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired you to\\nconsider, when you insisted on the motive of public good, that the\\n_Yahoos_ were a species of animals utterly incapable of amendment by\\nprecept or example: and so it has proved; for, instead of seeing a full\\nstop put to all abuses and corruptions, at least in this little island,\\nas I had reason to expect; behold, after above six months warning, I\\ncannot learn that my book has produced one single effect according to\\nmy intentions. I desired you would let me know, by a letter, when party\\nand faction were extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders\\nhonest and modest, with some tincture of common sense, and Smithfield\\nblazing with pyramids of law books; the young nobility’s education\\nentirely changed; the physicians banished; the female _Yahoos_\\nabounding in virtue, honour, truth, and good sense; courts and levees\\nof great ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit, and\\nlearning rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse\\ncondemned to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst\\nwith their own ink. These, and a thousand other reformations, I firmly\\ncounted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly\\ndeducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned,\\nthat seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and\\nfolly to which _Yahoos_ are subject, if their natures had been capable\\nof the least disposition to virtue or wisdom. Yet, so far have you been\\nfrom answering my expectation in any of your letters; that on the\\ncontrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,\\nand reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself\\naccused of reflecting upon great state folk; of degrading human nature\\n(for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of abusing the\\nfemale sex. I find likewise that the writers of those bundles are not\\nagreed among themselves; for some of them will not allow me to be the\\nauthor of my own travels; and others make me author of books to which I\\nam wholly a stranger.\\n\\nI find likewise that your printer has been so careless as to confound\\nthe times, and mistake the dates, of my several voyages and returns;\\nneither assigning the true year, nor the true month, nor day of the\\nmonth: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since the\\npublication of my book; neither have I any copy left: however, I have\\nsent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there should\\nbe a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them; but shall leave\\nthat matter to my judicious and candid readers to adjust it as they\\nplease.\\n\\nI hear some of our sea _Yahoos_ find fault with my sea-language, as not\\nproper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my first\\nvoyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest mariners,\\nand learned to speak as they did. But I have since found that the sea\\n_Yahoos_ are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled in their\\nwords, which the latter change every year; insomuch, as I remember upon\\neach return to my own country their old dialect was so altered, that I\\ncould hardly understand the new. And I observe, when any _Yahoo_ comes\\nfrom London out of curiosity to visit me at my house, we neither of us\\nare able to deliver our conceptions in a manner intelligible to the\\nother.\\n\\nIf the censure of the _Yahoos_ could any way affect me, I should have\\ngreat reason to complain, that some of them are so bold as to think my\\nbook of travels a mere fiction out of mine own brain, and have gone so\\nfar as to drop hints, that the _Houyhnhnms_ and _Yahoos_ have no more\\nexistence than the inhabitants of Utopia.\\n\\nIndeed I must confess, that as to the people of _Lilliput_,\\n_Brobdingrag_ (for so the word should have been spelt, and not\\nerroneously _Brobdingnag_), and _Laputa_, I have never yet heard of any\\n_Yahoo_ so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have\\nrelated concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every\\nreader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of\\nthe _Houyhnhnms_ or _Yahoos_, when it is manifest as to the latter,\\nthere are so many thousands even in this country, who only differ from\\ntheir brother brutes in _Houyhnhnmland_, because they use a sort of\\njabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not their\\napprobation. The united praise of the whole race would be of less\\nconsequence to me, than the neighing of those two degenerate\\n_Houyhnhnms_ I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as\\nthey are, I still improve in some virtues without any mixture of vice.\\n\\nDo these miserable animals presume to think, that I am so degenerated\\nas to defend my veracity? _Yahoo_ as I am, it is well known through all\\n_Houyhnhnmland_, that, by the instructions and example of my\\nillustrious master, I was able in the compass of two years (although I\\nconfess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that infernal habit of\\nlying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so deeply rooted in the\\nvery souls of all my species; especially the Europeans.\\n\\nI have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but I\\nforbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely confess,\\nthat since my last return, some corruptions of my _Yahoo_ nature have\\nrevived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and\\nparticularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else\\nI should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming\\nthe _Yahoo_ race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all such\\nvisionary schemes for ever.\\n\\n_April_ 2, 1727\\n\\n\\nPART I. A VOYAGE TO LILLIPUT.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\n\\nThe author gives some account of himself and family. His first\\ninducements to travel. He is shipwrecked, and swims for his life, gets\\nsafe on shore in the country of Lilliput; is made a prisoner, and\\ncarried up the country.\\n\\n\\nMy father had a small estate in Nottinghamshire; I was the third of\\nfive sons. He sent me to Emanuel College in Cambridge at fourteen years\\nold, where I resided three years, and applied myself close to my\\nstudies; but the charge of maintaining me, although I had a very scanty\\nallowance, being too great for a narrow fortune, I was bound apprentice\\nto Mr. James Bates, an eminent surgeon in London, with whom I continued\\nfour years. My father now and then sending me small sums of money, I\\nlaid them out in learning navigation, and other parts of the\\nmathematics, useful to those who intend to travel, as I always believed\\nit would be, some time or other, my fortune to do. When I left Mr.\\nBates, I went down to my father: where, by the assistance of him and my\\nuncle John, and some other relations, I got forty pounds, and a promise\\nof thirty pounds a year to maintain me at Leyden: there I studied\\nphysic two years and seven months, knowing it would be useful in long\\nvoyages.\\n\\nSoon after my return from Leyden, I was recommended by my good master,\\nMr. Bates, to be surgeon to the Swallow, Captain Abraham Pannel,\\ncommander; with whom I continued three years and a half, making a\\nvoyage or two into the Levant, and some other parts. When I came back I\\nresolved to settle in London; to which Mr. Bates, my master, encouraged\\nme, and by him I was recommended to several patients. I took part of a\\nsmall house in the Old Jewry; and being advised to alter my condition,\\nI married Mrs. Mary Burton, second daughter to Mr. Edmund Burton,\\nhosier, in Newgate-street, with whom I received four hundred pounds for\\na portion.\\n\\nBut my good master Bates dying in two years after, and I having few\\nfriends, my business began to fail; for my conscience would not suffer\\nme to imitate the bad practice of too many among my brethren. Having\\ntherefore consulted with my wife, and some of my acquaintance, I\\ndetermined to go again to sea. I was surgeon successively in two ships,\\nand made several voyages, for six years, to the East and West Indies,\\nby which I got some addition to my fortune. My hours of leisure I spent\\nin reading the best authors, ancient and modern, being always provided\\nwith a good number of books; and when I was ashore, in observing the\\nmanners and dispositions of the people, as well as learning their\\nlanguage; wherein I had a great facility, by the strength of my memory.\\n\\nThe last of these voyages not proving very fortunate, I grew weary of\\nthe sea, and intended to stay at home with my wife and family. I\\nremoved from the Old Jewry to Fetter Lane, and from thence to Wapping,\\nhoping to get business among the sailors; but it would not turn to\\naccount. After three years expectation that things would mend, I\\naccepted an advantageous offer from Captain William Prichard, master of\\nthe Antelope, who was making a voyage to the South Sea. We set sail\\nfrom Bristol, May 4, 1699, and our voyage was at first very prosperous.\\n\\nIt would not be proper, for some reasons, to trouble the reader with\\nthe particulars of our adventures in those seas; let it suffice to\\ninform him, that in our passage from thence to the East Indies, we were\\ndriven by a violent storm to the north-west of Van Diemen’s Land. By an\\nobservation, we found ourselves in the latitude of 30 degrees 2 minutes\\nsouth. Twelve of our crew were dead by immoderate labour and ill food;\\nthe rest were in a very weak condition. On the 5th of November, which\\nwas the beginning of summer in those parts, the weather being very\\nhazy, the seamen spied a rock within half a cable’s length of the ship;\\nbut the wind was so strong, that we were driven directly upon it, and\\nimmediately split. Six of the crew, of whom I was one, having let down\\nthe boat into the sea, made a shift to get clear of the ship and the\\nrock. We rowed, by my computation, about three leagues, till we were\\nable to work no longer, being already spent with labour while we were\\nin the ship. We therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves,\\nand in about half an hour the boat was overset by a sudden flurry from\\nthe north. What became of my companions in the boat, as well as of\\nthose who escaped on the rock, or were left in the vessel, I cannot\\ntell; but conclude they were all lost. For my own part, I swam as\\nfortune directed me, and was pushed forward by wind and tide. I often\\nlet my legs drop, and could feel no bottom; but when I was almost gone,\\nand able to struggle no longer, I found myself within my depth; and by\\nthis time the storm was much abated. The declivity was so small, that I\\nwalked near a mile before I got to the shore, which I conjectured was\\nabout eight o’clock in the evening. I then advanced forward near half a\\nmile, but could not discover any sign of houses or inhabitants; at\\nleast I was in so weak a condition, that I did not observe them. I was\\nextremely tired, and with that, and the heat of the weather, and about\\nhalf a pint of brandy that I drank as I left the ship, I found myself\\nmuch inclined to sleep. I lay down on the grass, which was very short\\nand soft, where I slept sounder than ever I remembered to have done in\\nmy life, and, as I reckoned, about nine hours; for when I awaked, it\\nwas just day-light. I attempted to rise, but was not able to stir: for,\\nas I happened to lie on my back, I found my arms and legs were strongly\\nfastened on each side to the ground; and my hair, which was long and\\nthick, tied down in the same manner. I likewise felt several slender\\nligatures across my body, from my arm-pits to my thighs. I could only\\nlook upwards; the sun began to grow hot, and the light offended my\\neyes. I heard a confused noise about me; but in the posture I lay,\\ncould see nothing except the sky. In a little time I felt something\\nalive moving on my left leg, which advancing gently forward over my\\nbreast, came almost up to my chin; when, bending my eyes downwards as\\nmuch as I could, I perceived it to be a human creature not six inches\\nhigh, with a bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his back. In\\nthe mean time, I felt at least forty more of the same kind (as I\\nconjectured) following the first. I was in the utmost astonishment, and\\nroared so loud, that they all ran back in a fright; and some of them,\\nas I was afterwards told, were hurt with the falls they got by leaping\\nfrom my sides upon the ground. However, they soon returned, and one of\\nthem, who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face, lifting up\\nhis hands and eyes by way of admiration, cried out in a shrill but\\ndistinct voice, _Hekinah degul_: the others repeated the same words\\nseveral times, but then I knew not what they meant. I lay all this\\nwhile, as the reader may believe, in great uneasiness. At length,\\nstruggling to get loose, I had the fortune to break the strings, and\\nwrench out the pegs that fastened my left arm to the ground; for, by\\nlifting it up to my face, I discovered the methods they had taken to\\nbind me, and at the same time with a violent pull, which gave me\\nexcessive pain, I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair\\non the left side, so that I was just able to turn my head about two\\ninches. But the creatures ran off a second time, before I could seize\\nthem; whereupon there was a great shout in a very shrill accent, and\\nafter it ceased I heard one of them cry aloud _Tolgo phonac_; when in\\nan instant I felt above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand,\\nwhich, pricked me like so many needles; and besides, they shot another\\nflight into the air, as we do bombs in Europe, whereof many, I suppose,\\nfell on my body, (though I felt them not), and some on my face, which I\\nimmediately covered with my left hand. When this shower of arrows was\\nover, I fell a groaning with grief and pain; and then striving again to\\nget loose, they discharged another volley larger than the first, and\\nsome of them attempted with spears to stick me in the sides; but by\\ngood luck I had on a buff jerkin, which they could not pierce. I\\nthought it the most prudent method to lie still, and my design was to\\ncontinue so till night, when, my left hand being already loose, I could\\neasily free myself: and as for the inhabitants, I had reason to believe\\nI might be a match for the greatest army they could bring against me,\\nif they were all of the same size with him that I saw. But fortune\\ndisposed otherwise of me. When the people observed I was quiet, they\\ndischarged no more arrows; but, by the noise I heard, I knew their\\nnumbers increased; and about four yards from me, over against my right\\near, I heard a knocking for above an hour, like that of people at work;\\nwhen turning my head that way, as well as the pegs and strings would\\npermit me, I saw a stage erected about a foot and a half from the\\nground, capable of holding four of the inhabitants, with two or three\\nladders to mount it: from whence one of them, who seemed to be a person\\nof quality, made me a long speech, whereof I understood not one\\nsyllable. But I should have mentioned, that before the principal person\\nbegan his oration, he cried out three times, _Langro dehul san_ (these\\nwords and the former were afterwards repeated and explained to me);\\nwhereupon, immediately, about fifty of the inhabitants came and cut the\\nstrings that fastened the left side of my head, which gave me the\\nliberty of turning it to the right, and of observing the person and\\ngesture of him that was to speak. He appeared to be of a middle age,\\nand taller than any of the other three who attended him, whereof one\\nwas a page that held up his train, and seemed to be somewhat longer\\nthan my middle finger; the other two stood one on each side to support\\nhim. He acted every part of an orator, and I could observe many periods\\nof threatenings, and others of promises, pity, and kindness. I answered\\nin a few words, but in the most submissive manner, lifting up my left\\nhand, and both my eyes to the sun, as calling him for a witness; and\\nbeing almost famished with hunger, having not eaten a morsel for some\\nhours before I left the ship, I found the demands of nature so strong\\nupon me, that I could not forbear showing my impatience (perhaps\\nagainst the strict rules of decency) by putting my finger frequently to\\nmy mouth, to signify that I wanted food. The _hurgo_ (for so they call\\na great lord, as I afterwards learnt) understood me very well. He\\ndescended from the stage, and commanded that several ladders should be\\napplied to my sides, on which above a hundred of the inhabitants\\nmounted and walked towards my mouth, laden with baskets full of meat,\\nwhich had been provided and sent thither by the king’s orders, upon the\\nfirst intelligence he received of me. I observed there was the flesh of\\nseveral animals, but could not distinguish them by the taste. There\\nwere shoulders, legs, and loins, shaped like those of mutton, and very\\nwell dressed, but smaller than the wings of a lark. I ate them by two\\nor three at a mouthful, and took three loaves at a time, about the\\nbigness of musket bullets. They supplied me as fast as they could,\\nshowing a thousand marks of wonder and astonishment at my bulk and\\nappetite. I then made another sign, that I wanted drink. They found by\\nmy eating that a small quantity would not suffice me; and being a most\\ningenious people, they slung up, with great dexterity, one of their\\nlargest hogsheads, then rolled it towards my hand, and beat out the\\ntop; I drank it off at a draught, which I might well do, for it did not\\nhold half a pint, and tasted like a small wine of Burgundy, but much\\nmore delicious. They brought me a second hogshead, which I drank in the\\nsame manner, and made signs for more; but they had none to give me.\\nWhen I had performed these wonders, they shouted for joy, and danced\\nupon my breast, repeating several times as they did at first, _Hekinah\\ndegul_. They made me a sign that I should throw down the two hogsheads,\\nbut first warning the people below to stand out of the way, crying\\naloud, _Borach mevolah_; and when they saw the vessels in the air,\\nthere was a universal shout of _Hekinah degul_. I confess I was often\\ntempted, while they were passing backwards and forwards on my body, to\\nseize forty or fifty of the first that came in my reach, and dash them\\nagainst the ground. But the remembrance of what I had felt, which\\nprobably might not be the worst they could do, and the promise of\\nhonour I made them—for so I interpreted my submissive behaviour—soon\\ndrove out these imaginations. Besides, I now considered myself as bound\\nby the laws of hospitality, to a people who had treated me with so much\\nexpense and magnificence. However, in my thoughts I could not\\nsufficiently wonder at the intrepidity of these diminutive mortals, who\\ndurst venture to mount and walk upon my body, while one of my hands was\\nat liberty, without trembling at the very sight of so prodigious a\\ncreature as I must appear to them. After some time, when they observed\\nthat I made no more demands for meat, there appeared before me a person\\nof high rank from his imperial majesty. His excellency, having mounted\\non the small of my right leg, advanced forwards up to my face, with\\nabout a dozen of his retinue; and producing his credentials under the\\nsignet royal, which he applied close to my eyes, spoke about ten\\nminutes without any signs of anger, but with a kind of determinate\\nresolution, often pointing forwards, which, as I afterwards found, was\\ntowards the capital city, about half a mile distant; whither it was\\nagreed by his majesty in council that I must be conveyed. I answered in\\nfew words, but to no purpose, and made a sign with my hand that was\\nloose, putting it to the other (but over his excellency’s head for fear\\nof hurting him or his train) and then to my own head and body, to\\nsignify that I desired my liberty. It appeared that he understood me\\nwell enough, for he shook his head by way of disapprobation, and held\\nhis hand in a posture to show that I must be carried as a prisoner.\\nHowever, he made other signs to let me understand that I should have\\nmeat and drink enough, and very good treatment. Whereupon I once more\\nthought of attempting to break my bonds; but again, when I felt the\\nsmart of their arrows upon my face and hands, which were all in\\nblisters, and many of the darts still sticking in them, and observing\\nlikewise that the number of my enemies increased, I gave tokens to let\\nthem know that they might do with me what they pleased. Upon this, the\\n_hurgo_ and his train withdrew, with much civility and cheerful\\ncountenances. Soon after I heard a general shout, with frequent\\nrepetitions of the words _Peplom selan_; and I felt great numbers of\\npeople on my left side relaxing the cords to such a degree, that I was\\nable to turn upon my right, and to ease myself with making water; which\\nI very plentifully did, to the great astonishment of the people; who,\\nconjecturing by my motion what I was going to do, immediately opened to\\nthe right and left on that side, to avoid the torrent, which fell with\\nsuch noise and violence from me. But before this, they had daubed my\\nface and both my hands with a sort of ointment, very pleasant to the\\nsmell, which, in a few minutes, removed all the smart of their arrows.\\nThese circumstances, added to the refreshment I had received by their\\nvictuals and drink, which were very nourishing, disposed me to sleep. I\\nslept about eight hours, as I was afterwards assured; and it was no\\nwonder, for the physicians, by the emperor’s order, had mingled a\\nsleepy potion in the hogsheads of wine.\\n\\nIt seems, that upon the first moment I was discovered sleeping on the\\nground, after my landing, the emperor had early notice of it by an\\nexpress; and determined in council, that I should be tied in the manner\\nI have related, (which was done in the night while I slept;) that\\nplenty of meat and drink should be sent to me, and a machine prepared\\nto carry me to the capital city.\\n\\nThis resolution perhaps may appear very bold and dangerous, and I am\\nconfident would not be imitated by any prince in Europe on the like\\noccasion. However, in my opinion, it was extremely prudent, as well as\\ngenerous: for, supposing these people had endeavoured to kill me with\\ntheir spears and arrows, while I was asleep, I should certainly have\\nawaked with the first sense of smart, which might so far have roused my\\nrage and strength, as to have enabled me to break the strings wherewith\\nI was tied; after which, as they were not able to make resistance, so\\nthey could expect no mercy.\\n\\nThese people are most excellent mathematicians, and arrived to a great\\nperfection in mechanics, by the countenance and encouragement of the\\nemperor, who is a renowned patron of learning. This prince has several\\nmachines fixed on wheels, for the carriage of trees and other great\\nweights. He often builds his largest men of war, whereof some are nine\\nfeet long, in the woods where the timber grows, and has them carried on\\nthese engines three or four hundred yards to the sea. Five hundred\\ncarpenters and engineers were immediately set at work to prepare the\\ngreatest engine they had. It was a frame of wood raised three inches\\nfrom the ground, about seven feet long, and four wide, moving upon\\ntwenty-two wheels. The shout I heard was upon the arrival of this\\nengine, which, it seems, set out in four hours after my landing. It was\\nbrought parallel to me, as I lay. But the principal difficulty was to\\nraise and place me in this vehicle. Eighty poles, each of one foot\\nhigh, were erected for this purpose, and very strong cords, of the\\nbigness of packthread, were fastened by hooks to many bandages, which\\nthe workmen had girt round my neck, my hands, my body, and my legs.\\nNine hundred of the strongest men were employed to draw up these cords,\\nby many pulleys fastened on the poles; and thus, in less than three\\nhours, I was raised and slung into the engine, and there tied fast. All\\nthis I was told; for, while the operation was performing, I lay in a\\nprofound sleep, by the force of that soporiferous medicine infused into\\nmy liquor. Fifteen hundred of the emperor’s largest horses, each about\\nfour inches and a half high, were employed to draw me towards the\\nmetropolis, which, as I said, was half a mile distant.\\n\\nAbout four hours after we began our journey, I awaked by a very\\nridiculous accident; for the carriage being stopped a while, to adjust\\nsomething that was out of order, two or three of the young natives had\\nthe curiosity to see how I looked when I was asleep; they climbed up\\ninto the engine, and advancing very softly to my face, one of them, an\\nofficer in the guards, put the sharp end of his half-pike a good way up\\ninto my left nostril, which tickled my nose like a straw, and made me\\nsneeze violently; whereupon they stole off unperceived, and it was\\nthree weeks before I knew the cause of my waking so suddenly. We made a\\nlong march the remaining part of the day, and, rested at night with\\nfive hundred guards on each side of me, half with torches, and half\\nwith bows and arrows, ready to shoot me if I should offer to stir. The\\nnext morning at sunrise we continued our march, and arrived within two\\nhundred yards of the city gates about noon. The emperor, and all his\\ncourt, came out to meet us; but his great officers would by no means\\nsuffer his majesty to endanger his person by mounting on my body.\\n\\nAt the place where the carriage stopped there stood an ancient temple,\\nesteemed to be the largest in the whole kingdom; which, having been\\npolluted some years before by an unnatural murder, was, according to\\nthe zeal of those people, looked upon as profane, and therefore had\\nbeen applied to common use, and all the ornaments and furniture carried\\naway. In this edifice it was determined I should lodge. The great gate\\nfronting to the north was about four feet high, and almost two feet\\nwide, through which I could easily creep. On each side of the gate was\\na small window, not above six inches from the ground: into that on the\\nleft side, the king’s smith conveyed fourscore and eleven chains, like\\nthose that hang to a lady’s watch in Europe, and almost as large, which\\nwere locked to my left leg with six-and-thirty padlocks. Over against\\nthis temple, on the other side of the great highway, at twenty feet\\ndistance, there was a turret at least five feet high. Here the emperor\\nascended, with many principal lords of his court, to have an\\nopportunity of viewing me, as I was told, for I could not see them. It\\nwas reckoned that above a hundred thousand inhabitants came out of the\\ntown upon the same errand; and, in spite of my guards, I believe there\\ncould not be fewer than ten thousand at several times, who mounted my\\nbody by the help of ladders. But a proclamation was soon issued, to\\nforbid it upon pain of death. When the workmen found it was impossible\\nfor me to break loose, they cut all the strings that bound me;\\nwhereupon I rose up, with as melancholy a disposition as ever I had in\\nmy life. But the noise and astonishment of the people, at seeing me\\nrise and walk, are not to be expressed. The chains that held my left\\nleg were about two yards long, and gave me not only the liberty of\\nwalking backwards and forwards in a semicircle, but, being fixed within\\nfour inches of the gate, allowed me to creep in, and lie at my full\\nlength in the temple.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\nThe emperor of Lilliput, attended by several of the nobility, comes to\\nsee the author in his confinement. The emperor’s person and habit\\ndescribed. Learned men appointed to teach the author their language. He\\ngains favour by his mild disposition. His pockets are searched, and his\\nsword and pistols taken from him.\\n\\n\\nWhen I found myself on my feet, I looked about me, and must confess I\\nnever beheld a more entertaining prospect. The country around appeared\\nlike a continued garden, and the enclosed fields, which were generally\\nforty feet square, resembled so many beds of flowers. These fields were\\nintermingled with woods of half a stang, [301] and the tallest trees,\\nas I could judge, appeared to be seven feet high. I viewed the town on\\nmy left hand, which looked like the painted scene of a city in a\\ntheatre.\\n\\nI had been for some hours extremely pressed by the necessities of\\nnature; which was no wonder, it being almost two days since I had last\\ndisburdened myself. I was under great difficulties between urgency and\\nshame. The best expedient I could think of, was to creep into my house,\\nwhich I accordingly did; and shutting the gate after me, I went as far\\nas the length of my chain would suffer, and discharged my body of that\\nuneasy load. But this was the only time I was ever guilty of so\\nuncleanly an action; for which I cannot but hope the candid reader will\\ngive some allowance, after he has maturely and impartially considered\\nmy case, and the distress I was in. From this time my constant practice\\nwas, as soon as I rose, to perform that business in open air, at the\\nfull extent of my chain; and due care was taken every morning before\\ncompany came, that the offensive matter should be carried off in\\nwheel-barrows, by two servants appointed for that purpose. I would not\\nhave dwelt so long upon a circumstance that, perhaps, at first sight,\\nmay appear not very momentous, if I had not thought it necessary to\\njustify my character, in point of cleanliness, to the world; which, I\\nam told, some of my maligners have been pleased, upon this and other\\noccasions, to call in question.\\n\\nWhen this adventure was at an end, I came back out of my house, having\\noccasion for fresh air. The emperor was already descended from the\\ntower, and advancing on horseback towards me, which had like to have\\ncost him dear; for the beast, though very well trained, yet wholly\\nunused to such a sight, which appeared as if a mountain moved before\\nhim, reared up on its hinder feet: but that prince, who is an excellent\\nhorseman, kept his seat, till his attendants ran in, and held the\\nbridle, while his majesty had time to dismount. When he alighted, he\\nsurveyed me round with great admiration; but kept beyond the length of\\nmy chain. He ordered his cooks and butlers, who were already prepared,\\nto give me victuals and drink, which they pushed forward in a sort of\\nvehicles upon wheels, till I could reach them. I took these vehicles\\nand soon emptied them all; twenty of them were filled with meat, and\\nten with liquor; each of the former afforded me two or three good\\nmouthfuls; and I emptied the liquor of ten vessels, which was contained\\nin earthen vials, into one vehicle, drinking it off at a draught; and\\nso I did with the rest. The empress, and young princes of the blood of\\nboth sexes, attended by many ladies, sat at some distance in their\\nchairs; but upon the accident that happened to the emperor’s horse,\\nthey alighted, and came near his person, which I am now going to\\ndescribe. He is taller by almost the breadth of my nail, than any of\\nhis court; which alone is enough to strike an awe into the beholders.\\nHis features are strong and masculine, with an Austrian lip and arched\\nnose, his complexion olive, his countenance erect, his body and limbs\\nwell proportioned, all his motions graceful, and his deportment\\nmajestic. He was then past his prime, being twenty-eight years and\\nthree quarters old, of which he had reigned about seven in great\\nfelicity, and generally victorious. For the better convenience of\\nbeholding him, I lay on my side, so that my face was parallel to his,\\nand he stood but three yards off: however, I have had him since many\\ntimes in my hand, and therefore cannot be deceived in the description.\\nHis dress was very plain and simple, and the fashion of it between the\\nAsiatic and the European; but he had on his head a light helmet of\\ngold, adorned with jewels, and a plume on the crest. He held his sword\\ndrawn in his hand to defend himself, if I should happen to break loose;\\nit was almost three inches long; the hilt and scabbard were gold\\nenriched with diamonds. His voice was shrill, but very clear and\\narticulate; and I could distinctly hear it when I stood up. The ladies\\nand courtiers were all most magnificently clad; so that the spot they\\nstood upon seemed to resemble a petticoat spread upon the ground,\\nembroidered with figures of gold and silver. His imperial majesty spoke\\noften to me, and I returned answers: but neither of us could understand\\na syllable. There were several of his priests and lawyers present (as I\\nconjectured by their habits), who were commanded to address themselves\\nto me; and I spoke to them in as many languages as I had the least\\nsmattering of, which were High and Low Dutch, Latin, French, Spanish,\\nItalian, and Lingua Franca, but all to no purpose. After about two\\nhours the court retired, and I was left with a strong guard, to prevent\\nthe impertinence, and probably the malice of the rabble, who were very\\nimpatient to crowd about me as near as they durst; and some of them had\\nthe impudence to shoot their arrows at me, as I sat on the ground by\\nthe door of my house, whereof one very narrowly missed my left eye. But\\nthe colonel ordered six of the ringleaders to be seized, and thought no\\npunishment so proper as to deliver them bound into my hands; which some\\nof his soldiers accordingly did, pushing them forward with the\\nbutt-ends of their pikes into my reach. I took them all in my right\\nhand, put five of them into my coat-pocket; and as to the sixth, I made\\na countenance as if I would eat him alive. The poor man squalled\\nterribly, and the colonel and his officers were in much pain,\\nespecially when they saw me take out my penknife: but I soon put them\\nout of fear; for, looking mildly, and immediately cutting the strings\\nhe was bound with, I set him gently on the ground, and away he ran. I\\ntreated the rest in the same manner, taking them one by one out of my\\npocket; and I observed both the soldiers and people were highly\\ndelighted at this mark of my clemency, which was represented very much\\nto my advantage at court.\\n\\nTowards night I got with some difficulty into my house, where I lay on\\nthe ground, and continued to do so about a fortnight; during which\\ntime, the emperor gave orders to have a bed prepared for me. Six\\nhundred beds of the common measure were brought in carriages, and\\nworked up in my house; a hundred and fifty of their beds, sewn\\ntogether, made up the breadth and length; and these were four double:\\nwhich, however, kept me but very indifferently from the hardness of the\\nfloor, that was of smooth stone. By the same computation, they provided\\nme with sheets, blankets, and coverlets, tolerable enough for one who\\nhad been so long inured to hardships.\\n\\nAs the news of my arrival spread through the kingdom, it brought\\nprodigious numbers of rich, idle, and curious people to see me; so that\\nthe villages were almost emptied; and great neglect of tillage and\\nhousehold affairs must have ensued, if his imperial majesty had not\\nprovided, by several proclamations and orders of state, against this\\ninconveniency. He directed that those who had already beheld me should\\nreturn home, and not presume to come within fifty yards of my house,\\nwithout license from the court; whereby the secretaries of state got\\nconsiderable fees.\\n\\nIn the mean time the emperor held frequent councils, to debate what\\ncourse should be taken with me; and I was afterwards assured by a\\nparticular friend, a person of great quality, who was as much in the\\nsecret as any, that the court was under many difficulties concerning\\nme. They apprehended my breaking loose; that my diet would be very\\nexpensive, and might cause a famine. Sometimes they determined to\\nstarve me; or at least to shoot me in the face and hands with poisoned\\narrows, which would soon despatch me; but again they considered, that\\nthe stench of so large a carcass might produce a plague in the\\nmetropolis, and probably spread through the whole kingdom. In the midst\\nof these consultations, several officers of the army went to the door\\nof the great council-chamber, and two of them being admitted, gave an\\naccount of my behaviour to the six criminals above-mentioned; which\\nmade so favourable an impression in the breast of his majesty and the\\nwhole board, in my behalf, that an imperial commission was issued out,\\nobliging all the villages, nine hundred yards round the city, to\\ndeliver in every morning six beeves, forty sheep, and other victuals\\nfor my sustenance; together with a proportionable quantity of bread,\\nand wine, and other liquors; for the due payment of which, his majesty\\ngave assignments upon his treasury:—for this prince lives chiefly upon\\nhis own demesnes; seldom, except upon great occasions, raising any\\nsubsidies upon his subjects, who are bound to attend him in his wars at\\ntheir own expense. An establishment was also made of six hundred\\npersons to be my domestics, who had board-wages allowed for their\\nmaintenance, and tents built for them very conveniently on each side of\\nmy door. It was likewise ordered, that three hundred tailors should\\nmake me a suit of clothes, after the fashion of the country; that six\\nof his majesty’s greatest scholars should be employed to instruct me in\\ntheir language; and lastly, that the emperor’s horses, and those of the\\nnobility and troops of guards, should be frequently exercised in my\\nsight, to accustom themselves to me. All these orders were duly put in\\nexecution; and in about three weeks I made a great progress in learning\\ntheir language; during which time the emperor frequently honoured me\\nwith his visits, and was pleased to assist my masters in teaching me.\\nWe began already to converse together in some sort; and the first words\\nI learnt, were to express my desire “that he would please give me my\\nliberty;” which I every day repeated on my knees. His answer, as I\\ncould comprehend it, was, “that this must be a work of time, not to be\\nthought on without the advice of his council, and that first I must\\n_lumos kelmin pesso desmar lon emposo_;” that is, swear a peace with\\nhim and his kingdom. However, that I should be used with all kindness.\\nAnd he advised me to “acquire, by my patience and discreet behaviour,\\nthe good opinion of himself and his subjects.” He desired “I would not\\ntake it ill, if he gave orders to certain proper officers to search me;\\nfor probably I might carry about me several weapons, which must needs\\nbe dangerous things, if they answered the bulk of so prodigious a\\nperson.” I said, “His majesty should be satisfied; for I was ready to\\nstrip myself, and turn up my pockets before him.” This I delivered part\\nin words, and part in signs. He replied, “that, by the laws of the\\nkingdom, I must be searched by two of his officers; that he knew this\\ncould not be done without my consent and assistance; and he had so good\\nan opinion of my generosity and justice, as to trust their persons in\\nmy hands; that whatever they took from me, should be returned when I\\nleft the country, or paid for at the rate which I would set upon them.”\\nI took up the two officers in my hands, put them first into my\\ncoat-pockets, and then into every other pocket about me, except my two\\nfobs, and another secret pocket, which I had no mind should be\\nsearched, wherein I had some little necessaries that were of no\\nconsequence to any but myself. In one of my fobs there was a silver\\nwatch, and in the other a small quantity of gold in a purse. These\\ngentlemen, having pen, ink, and paper, about them, made an exact\\ninventory of every thing they saw; and when they had done, desired I\\nwould set them down, that they might deliver it to the emperor. This\\ninventory I afterwards translated into English, and is, word for word,\\nas follows:\\n\\n\\n“_Imprimis_: In the right coat-pocket of the great man-mountain” (for\\nso I interpret the words _quinbus flestrin_,) “after the strictest\\nsearch, we found only one great piece of coarse-cloth, large enough to\\nbe a foot-cloth for your majesty’s chief room of state. In the left\\npocket we saw a huge silver chest, with a cover of the same metal,\\nwhich we, the searchers, were not able to lift. We desired it should be\\nopened, and one of us stepping into it, found himself up to the mid leg\\nin a sort of dust, some part whereof flying up to our faces set us both\\na sneezing for several times together. In his right waistcoat-pocket we\\nfound a prodigious bundle of white thin substances, folded one over\\nanother, about the bigness of three men, tied with a strong cable, and\\nmarked with black figures; which we humbly conceive to be writings,\\nevery letter almost half as large as the palm of our hands. In the left\\nthere was a sort of engine, from the back of which were extended twenty\\nlong poles, resembling the pallisados before your majesty’s court:\\nwherewith we conjecture the man-mountain combs his head; for we did not\\nalways trouble him with questions, because we found it a great\\ndifficulty to make him understand us. In the large pocket, on the right\\nside of his middle cover” (so I translate the word _ranfulo_, by which\\nthey meant my breeches,) “we saw a hollow pillar of iron, about the\\nlength of a man, fastened to a strong piece of timber larger than the\\npillar; and upon one side of the pillar, were huge pieces of iron\\nsticking out, cut into strange figures, which we know not what to make\\nof. In the left pocket, another engine of the same kind. In the smaller\\npocket on the right side, were several round flat pieces of white and\\nred metal, of different bulk; some of the white, which seemed to be\\nsilver, were so large and heavy, that my comrade and I could hardly\\nlift them. In the left pocket were two black pillars irregularly\\nshaped: we could not, without difficulty, reach the top of them, as we\\nstood at the bottom of his pocket. One of them was covered, and seemed\\nall of a piece: but at the upper end of the other there appeared a\\nwhite round substance, about twice the bigness of our heads. Within\\neach of these was enclosed a prodigious plate of steel; which, by our\\norders, we obliged him to show us, because we apprehended they might be\\ndangerous engines. He took them out of their cases, and told us, that\\nin his own country his practice was to shave his beard with one of\\nthese, and cut his meat with the other. There were two pockets which we\\ncould not enter: these he called his fobs; they were two large slits\\ncut into the top of his middle cover, but squeezed close by the\\npressure of his belly. Out of the right fob hung a great silver chain,\\nwith a wonderful kind of engine at the bottom. We directed him to draw\\nout whatever was at the end of that chain; which appeared to be a\\nglobe, half silver, and half of some transparent metal; for, on the\\ntransparent side, we saw certain strange figures circularly drawn, and\\nthought we could touch them, till we found our fingers stopped by the\\nlucid substance. He put this engine into our ears, which made an\\nincessant noise, like that of a water-mill: and we conjecture it is\\neither some unknown animal, or the god that he worships; but we are\\nmore inclined to the latter opinion, because he assured us, (if we\\nunderstood him right, for he expressed himself very imperfectly) that\\nhe seldom did any thing without consulting it. He called it his oracle,\\nand said, it pointed out the time for every action of his life. From\\nthe left fob he took out a net almost large enough for a fisherman, but\\ncontrived to open and shut like a purse, and served him for the same\\nuse: we found therein several massy pieces of yellow metal, which, if\\nthey be real gold, must be of immense value.\\n\\n“Having thus, in obedience to your majesty’s commands, diligently\\nsearched all his pockets, we observed a girdle about his waist made of\\nthe hide of some prodigious animal, from which, on the left side, hung\\na sword of the length of five men; and on the right, a bag or pouch\\ndivided into two cells, each cell capable of holding three of your\\nmajesty’s subjects. In one of these cells were several globes, or\\nballs, of a most ponderous metal, about the bigness of our heads, and\\nrequiring a strong hand to lift them: the other cell contained a heap\\nof certain black grains, but of no great bulk or weight, for we could\\nhold above fifty of them in the palms of our hands.\\n\\n“This is an exact inventory of what we found about the body of the\\nman-mountain, who used us with great civility, and due respect to your\\nmajesty’s commission. Signed and sealed on the fourth day of the\\neighty-ninth moon of your majesty’s auspicious reign.\\n\\n\\n                                     Clefrin Frelock, Marsi Frelock.”\\n\\nWhen this inventory was read over to the emperor, he directed me,\\nalthough in very gentle terms, to deliver up the several particulars.\\nHe first called for my scimitar, which I took out, scabbard and all. In\\nthe mean time he ordered three thousand of his choicest troops (who\\nthen attended him) to surround me at a distance, with their bows and\\narrows just ready to discharge; but I did not observe it, for my eyes\\nwere wholly fixed upon his majesty. He then desired me to draw my\\nscimitar, which, although it had got some rust by the sea water, was,\\nin most parts, exceeding bright. I did so, and immediately all the\\ntroops gave a shout between terror and surprise; for the sun shone\\nclear, and the reflection dazzled their eyes, as I waved the scimitar\\nto and fro in my hand. His majesty, who is a most magnanimous prince,\\nwas less daunted than I could expect: he ordered me to return it into\\nthe scabbard, and cast it on the ground as gently as I could, about six\\nfeet from the end of my chain. The next thing he demanded was one of\\nthe hollow iron pillars; by which he meant my pocket pistols. I drew it\\nout, and at his desire, as well as I could, expressed to him the use of\\nit; and charging it only with powder, which, by the closeness of my\\npouch, happened to escape wetting in the sea (an inconvenience against\\nwhich all prudent mariners take special care to provide,) I first\\ncautioned the emperor not to be afraid, and then I let it off in the\\nair. The astonishment here was much greater than at the sight of my\\nscimitar. Hundreds fell down as if they had been struck dead; and even\\nthe emperor, although he stood his ground, could not recover himself\\nfor some time. I delivered up both my pistols in the same manner as I\\nhad done my scimitar, and then my pouch of powder and bullets; begging\\nhim that the former might be kept from fire, for it would kindle with\\nthe smallest spark, and blow up his imperial palace into the air. I\\nlikewise delivered up my watch, which the emperor was very curious to\\nsee, and commanded two of his tallest yeomen of the guards to bear it\\non a pole upon their shoulders, as draymen in England do a barrel of\\nale. He was amazed at the continual noise it made, and the motion of\\nthe minute-hand, which he could easily discern; for their sight is much\\nmore acute than ours: he asked the opinions of his learned men about\\nit, which were various and remote, as the reader may well imagine\\nwithout my repeating; although indeed I could not very perfectly\\nunderstand them. I then gave up my silver and copper money, my purse,\\nwith nine large pieces of gold, and some smaller ones; my knife and\\nrazor, my comb and silver snuff-box, my handkerchief and journal-book.\\nMy scimitar, pistols, and pouch, were conveyed in carriages to his\\nmajesty’s stores; but the rest of my goods were returned me.\\n\\nI had as I before observed, one private pocket, which escaped their\\nsearch, wherein there was a pair of spectacles (which I sometimes use\\nfor the weakness of my eyes,) a pocket perspective, and some other\\nlittle conveniences; which, being of no consequence to the emperor, I\\ndid not think myself bound in honour to discover, and I apprehended\\nthey might be lost or spoiled if I ventured them out of my possession.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\nThe author diverts the emperor, and his nobility of both sexes, in a\\nvery uncommon manner. The diversions of the court of Lilliput\\ndescribed. The author has his liberty granted him upon certain\\nconditions.\\n\\n\\nMy gentleness and good behaviour had gained so far on the emperor and\\nhis court, and indeed upon the army and people in general, that I began\\nto conceive hopes of getting my liberty in a short time. I took all\\npossible methods to cultivate this favourable disposition. The natives\\ncame, by degrees, to be less apprehensive of any danger from me. I\\nwould sometimes lie down, and let five or six of them dance on my hand;\\nand at last the boys and girls would venture to come and play at\\nhide-and-seek in my hair. I had now made a good progress in\\nunderstanding and speaking the language. The emperor had a mind one day\\nto entertain me with several of the country shows, wherein they exceed\\nall nations I have known, both for dexterity and magnificence. I was\\ndiverted with none so much as that of the rope-dancers, performed upon\\na slender white thread, extended about two feet, and twelve inches from\\nthe ground. Upon which I shall desire liberty, with the reader’s\\npatience, to enlarge a little.\\n\\nThis diversion is only practised by those persons who are candidates\\nfor great employments, and high favour at court. They are trained in\\nthis art from their youth, and are not always of noble birth, or\\nliberal education. When a great office is vacant, either by death or\\ndisgrace (which often happens) five or six of those candidates\\npetition the emperor to entertain his majesty and the court with a\\ndance on the rope; and whoever jumps the highest, without falling,\\nsucceeds in the office. Very often the chief ministers themselves are\\ncommanded to show their skill, and to convince the emperor that they\\nhave not lost their faculty. Flimnap, the treasurer, is allowed to cut\\na caper on the straight rope, at least an inch higher than any other\\nlord in the whole empire. I have seen him do the summerset several\\ntimes together, upon a trencher fixed on a rope which is no thicker\\nthan a common packthread in England. My friend Reldresal, principal\\nsecretary for private affairs, is, in my opinion, if I am not partial,\\nthe second after the treasurer; the rest of the great officers are much\\nupon a par.\\n\\nThese diversions are often attended with fatal accidents, whereof great\\nnumbers are on record. I myself have seen two or three candidates break\\na limb. But the danger is much greater, when the ministers themselves\\nare commanded to show their dexterity; for, by contending to excel\\nthemselves and their fellows, they strain so far that there is hardly\\none of them who has not received a fall, and some of them two or three.\\nI was assured that, a year or two before my arrival, Flimnap would\\ninfallibly have broke his neck, if one of the king’s cushions, that\\naccidentally lay on the ground, had not weakened the force of his fall.\\n\\nThere is likewise another diversion, which is only shown before the\\nemperor and empress, and first minister, upon particular occasions. The\\nemperor lays on the table three fine silken threads of six inches long;\\none is blue, the other red, and the third green. These threads are\\nproposed as prizes for those persons whom the emperor has a mind to\\ndistinguish by a peculiar mark of his favour. The ceremony is performed\\nin his majesty’s great chamber of state, where the candidates are to\\nundergo a trial of dexterity very different from the former, and such\\nas I have not observed the least resemblance of in any other country of\\nthe new or old world. The emperor holds a stick in his hands, both ends\\nparallel to the horizon, while the candidates advancing, one by one,\\nsometimes leap over the stick, sometimes creep under it, backward and\\nforward, several times, according as the stick is advanced or\\ndepressed. Sometimes the emperor holds one end of the stick, and his\\nfirst minister the other; sometimes the minister has it entirely to\\nhimself. Whoever performs his part with most agility, and holds out the\\nlongest in leaping and creeping, is rewarded with the blue-coloured\\nsilk; the red is given to the next, and the green to the third, which\\nthey all wear girt twice round about the middle; and you see few great\\npersons about this court who are not adorned with one of these girdles.\\n\\nThe horses of the army, and those of the royal stables, having been\\ndaily led before me, were no longer shy, but would come up to my very\\nfeet without starting. The riders would leap them over my hand, as I\\nheld it on the ground; and one of the emperor’s huntsmen, upon a large\\ncourser, took my foot, shoe and all; which was indeed a prodigious\\nleap. I had the good fortune to divert the emperor one day after a very\\nextraordinary manner. I desired he would order several sticks of two\\nfeet high, and the thickness of an ordinary cane, to be brought me;\\nwhereupon his majesty commanded the master of his woods to give\\ndirections accordingly; and the next morning six woodmen arrived with\\nas many carriages, drawn by eight horses to each. I took nine of these\\nsticks, and fixing them firmly in the ground in a quadrangular figure,\\ntwo feet and a half square, I took four other sticks, and tied them\\nparallel at each corner, about two feet from the ground; then I\\nfastened my handkerchief to the nine sticks that stood erect; and\\nextended it on all sides, till it was tight as the top of a drum; and\\nthe four parallel sticks, rising about five inches higher than the\\nhandkerchief, served as ledges on each side. When I had finished my\\nwork, I desired the emperor to let a troop of his best horses\\ntwenty-four in number, come and exercise upon this plain. His majesty\\napproved of the proposal, and I took them up, one by one, in my hands,\\nready mounted and armed, with the proper officers to exercise them. As\\nsoon as they got into order they divided into two parties, performed\\nmock skirmishes, discharged blunt arrows, drew their swords, fled and\\npursued, attacked and retired, and in short discovered the best\\nmilitary discipline I ever beheld. The parallel sticks secured them and\\ntheir horses from falling over the stage; and the emperor was so much\\ndelighted, that he ordered this entertainment to be repeated several\\ndays, and once was pleased to be lifted up and give the word of\\ncommand; and with great difficulty persuaded even the empress herself\\nto let me hold her in her close chair within two yards of the stage,\\nwhen she was able to take a full view of the whole performance. It was\\nmy good fortune, that no ill accident happened in these entertainments;\\nonly once a fiery horse, that belonged to one of the captains, pawing\\nwith his hoof, struck a hole in my handkerchief, and his foot slipping,\\nhe overthrew his rider and himself; but I immediately relieved them\\nboth, and covering the hole with one hand, I set down the troop with\\nthe other, in the same manner as I took them up. The horse that fell\\nwas strained in the left shoulder, but the rider got no hurt; and I\\nrepaired my handkerchief as well as I could: however, I would not trust\\nto the strength of it any more, in such dangerous enterprises.\\n\\nAbout two or three days before I was set at liberty, as I was\\nentertaining the court with this kind of feat, there arrived an express\\nto inform his majesty, that some of his subjects, riding near the place\\nwhere I was first taken up, had seen a great black substance lying on\\nthe ground, very oddly shaped, extending its edges round, as wide as\\nhis majesty’s bedchamber, and rising up in the middle as high as a man;\\nthat it was no living creature, as they at first apprehended, for it\\nlay on the grass without motion; and some of them had walked round it\\nseveral times; that, by mounting upon each other’s shoulders, they had\\ngot to the top, which was flat and even, and, stamping upon it, they\\nfound that it was hollow within; that they humbly conceived it might be\\nsomething belonging to the man-mountain; and if his majesty pleased,\\nthey would undertake to bring it with only five horses. I presently\\nknew what they meant, and was glad at heart to receive this\\nintelligence. It seems, upon my first reaching the shore after our\\nshipwreck, I was in such confusion, that before I came to the place\\nwhere I went to sleep, my hat, which I had fastened with a string to my\\nhead while I was rowing, and had stuck on all the time I was swimming,\\nfell off after I came to land; the string, as I conjecture, breaking by\\nsome accident, which I never observed, but thought my hat had been lost\\nat sea. I entreated his imperial majesty to give orders it might be\\nbrought to me as soon as possible, describing to him the use and the\\nnature of it: and the next day the waggoners arrived with it, but not\\nin a very good condition; they had bored two holes in the brim, within\\nan inch and half of the edge, and fastened two hooks in the holes;\\nthese hooks were tied by a long cord to the harness, and thus my hat\\nwas dragged along for above half an English mile; but, the ground in\\nthat country being extremely smooth and level, it received less damage\\nthan I expected.\\n\\nTwo days after this adventure, the emperor, having ordered that part of\\nhis army which quarters in and about his metropolis, to be in\\nreadiness, took a fancy of diverting himself in a very singular manner.\\nHe desired I would stand like a Colossus, with my legs as far asunder\\nas I conveniently could. He then commanded his general (who was an old\\nexperienced leader, and a great patron of mine) to draw up the troops\\nin close order, and march them under me; the foot by twenty-four\\nabreast, and the horse by sixteen, with drums beating, colours flying,\\nand pikes advanced. This body consisted of three thousand foot, and a\\nthousand horse. His majesty gave orders, upon pain of death, that every\\nsoldier in his march should observe the strictest decency with regard\\nto my person; which however could not prevent some of the younger\\nofficers from turning up their eyes as they passed under me: and, to\\nconfess the truth, my breeches were at that time in so ill a condition,\\nthat they afforded some opportunities for laughter and admiration.\\n\\nI had sent so many memorials and petitions for my liberty, that his\\nmajesty at length mentioned the matter, first in the cabinet, and then\\nin a full council; where it was opposed by none, except Skyresh\\nBolgolam, who was pleased, without any provocation, to be my mortal\\nenemy. But it was carried against him by the whole board, and confirmed\\nby the emperor. That minister was _galbet_, or admiral of the realm,\\nvery much in his master’s confidence, and a person well versed in\\naffairs, but of a morose and sour complexion. However, he was at length\\npersuaded to comply; but prevailed that the articles and conditions\\nupon which I should be set free, and to which I must swear, should be\\ndrawn up by himself. These articles were brought to me by Skyresh\\nBolgolam in person attended by two under-secretaries, and several\\npersons of distinction. After they were read, I was demanded to swear\\nto the performance of them; first in the manner of my own country, and\\nafterwards in the method prescribed by their laws; which was, to hold\\nmy right foot in my left hand, and to place the middle finger of my\\nright hand on the crown of my head, and my thumb on the tip of my right\\near. But because the reader may be curious to have some idea of the\\nstyle and manner of expression peculiar to that people, as well as to\\nknow the article upon which I recovered my liberty, I have made a\\ntranslation of the whole instrument, word for word, as near as I was\\nable, which I here offer to the public.\\n\\n\\n“Golbasto Momarem Evlame Gurdilo Shefin Mully Ully Gue, most mighty\\nEmperor of Lilliput, delight and terror of the universe, whose\\ndominions extend five thousand _blustrugs_ (about twelve miles in\\ncircumference) to the extremities of the globe; monarch of all\\nmonarchs, taller than the sons of men; whose feet press down to the\\ncentre, and whose head strikes against the sun; at whose nod the\\nprinces of the earth shake their knees; pleasant as the spring,\\ncomfortable as the summer, fruitful as autumn, dreadful as winter: his\\nmost sublime majesty proposes to the man-mountain, lately arrived at\\nour celestial dominions, the following articles, which, by a solemn\\noath, he shall be obliged to perform:—\\n\\n“1st, The man-mountain shall not depart from our dominions, without our\\nlicense under our great seal.\\n\\n“2d, He shall not presume to come into our metropolis, without our\\nexpress order; at which time, the inhabitants shall have two hours\\nwarning to keep within doors.\\n\\n“3d, The said man-mountain shall confine his walks to our principal\\nhigh roads, and not offer to walk, or lie down, in a meadow or field of\\ncorn.\\n\\n“4th, As he walks the said roads, he shall take the utmost care not to\\ntrample upon the bodies of any of our loving subjects, their horses, or\\ncarriages, nor take any of our subjects into his hands without their\\nown consent.\\n\\n“5th, If an express requires extraordinary despatch, the man-mountain\\nshall be obliged to carry, in his pocket, the messenger and horse a six\\ndays journey, once in every moon, and return the said messenger back\\n(if so required) safe to our imperial presence.\\n\\n“6th, He shall be our ally against our enemies in the island of\\nBlefuscu, and do his utmost to destroy their fleet, which is now\\npreparing to invade us.\\n\\n“7th, That the said man-mountain shall, at his times of leisure, be\\naiding and assisting to our workmen, in helping to raise certain great\\nstones, towards covering the wall of the principal park, and other our\\nroyal buildings.\\n\\n“8th, That the said man-mountain shall, in two moons’ time, deliver in\\nan exact survey of the circumference of our dominions, by a computation\\nof his own paces round the coast.\\n\\n“Lastly, That, upon his solemn oath to observe all the above articles,\\nthe said man-mountain shall have a daily allowance of meat and drink\\nsufficient for the support of 1724 of our subjects, with free access to\\nour royal person, and other marks of our favour. Given at our palace at\\nBelfaborac, the twelfth day of the ninety-first moon of our reign.”\\n\\n\\nI swore and subscribed to these articles with great cheerfulness and\\ncontent, although some of them were not so honourable as I could have\\nwished; which proceeded wholly from the malice of Skyresh Bolgolam, the\\nhigh-admiral: whereupon my chains were immediately unlocked, and I was\\nat full liberty. The emperor himself, in person, did me the honour to\\nbe by at the whole ceremony. I made my acknowledgements by prostrating\\nmyself at his majesty’s feet: but he commanded me to rise; and after\\nmany gracious expressions, which, to avoid the censure of vanity, I\\nshall not repeat, he added, “that he hoped I should prove a useful\\nservant, and well deserve all the favours he had already conferred upon\\nme, or might do for the future.”\\n\\nThe reader may please to observe, that, in the last article of the\\nrecovery of my liberty, the emperor stipulates to allow me a quantity\\nof meat and drink sufficient for the support of 1724 Lilliputians. Some\\ntime after, asking a friend at court how they came to fix on that\\ndeterminate number, he told me that his majesty’s mathematicians,\\nhaving taken the height of my body by the help of a quadrant, and\\nfinding it to exceed theirs in the proportion of twelve to one, they\\nconcluded from the similarity of their bodies, that mine must contain\\nat least 1724 of theirs, and consequently would require as much food as\\nwas necessary to support that number of Lilliputians. By which the\\nreader may conceive an idea of the ingenuity of that people, as well as\\nthe prudent and exact economy of so great a prince.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\nMildendo, the metropolis of Lilliput, described, together with the\\nemperor’s palace. A conversation between the author and a principal\\nsecretary, concerning the affairs of that empire. The author’s offers\\nto serve the emperor in his wars.\\n\\n\\nThe first request I made, after I had obtained my liberty, was, that I\\nmight have license to see Mildendo, the metropolis; which the emperor\\neasily granted me, but with a special charge to do no hurt either to\\nthe inhabitants or their houses. The people had notice, by\\nproclamation, of my design to visit the town. The wall which\\nencompassed it is two feet and a half high, and at least eleven inches\\nbroad, so that a coach and horses may be driven very safely round it;\\nand it is flanked with strong towers at ten feet distance. I stepped\\nover the great western gate, and passed very gently, and sidling,\\nthrough the two principal streets, only in my short waistcoat, for fear\\nof damaging the roofs and eaves of the houses with the skirts of my\\ncoat. I walked with the utmost circumspection, to avoid treading on any\\nstragglers who might remain in the streets, although the orders were\\nvery strict, that all people should keep in their houses, at their own\\nperil. The garret windows and tops of houses were so crowded with\\nspectators, that I thought in all my travels I had not seen a more\\npopulous place. The city is an exact square, each side of the wall\\nbeing five hundred feet long. The two great streets, which run across\\nand divide it into four quarters, are five feet wide. The lanes and\\nalleys, which I could not enter, but only view them as I passed, are\\nfrom twelve to eighteen inches. The town is capable of holding five\\nhundred thousand souls: the houses are from three to five stories: the\\nshops and markets well provided.\\n\\nThe emperor’s palace is in the centre of the city where the two great\\nstreets meet. It is enclosed by a wall of two feet high, and twenty\\nfeet distance from the buildings. I had his majesty’s permission to\\nstep over this wall; and, the space being so wide between that and the\\npalace, I could easily view it on every side. The outward court is a\\nsquare of forty feet, and includes two other courts: in the inmost are\\nthe royal apartments, which I was very desirous to see, but found it\\nextremely difficult; for the great gates, from one square into another,\\nwere but eighteen inches high, and seven inches wide. Now the buildings\\nof the outer court were at least five feet high, and it was impossible\\nfor me to stride over them without infinite damage to the pile, though\\nthe walls were strongly built of hewn stone, and four inches thick. At\\nthe same time the emperor had a great desire that I should see the\\nmagnificence of his palace; but this I was not able to do till three\\ndays after, which I spent in cutting down with my knife some of the\\nlargest trees in the royal park, about a hundred yards distant from the\\ncity. Of these trees I made two stools, each about three feet high, and\\nstrong enough to bear my weight. The people having received notice a\\nsecond time, I went again through the city to the palace with my two\\nstools in my hands. When I came to the side of the outer court, I stood\\nupon one stool, and took the other in my hand; this I lifted over the\\nroof, and gently set it down on the space between the first and second\\ncourt, which was eight feet wide. I then stept over the building very\\nconveniently from one stool to the other, and drew up the first after\\nme with a hooked stick. By this contrivance I got into the inmost\\ncourt; and, lying down upon my side, I applied my face to the windows\\nof the middle stories, which were left open on purpose, and discovered\\nthe most splendid apartments that can be imagined. There I saw the\\nempress and the young princes, in their several lodgings, with their\\nchief attendants about them. Her imperial majesty was pleased to smile\\nvery graciously upon me, and gave me out of the window her hand to\\nkiss.\\n\\nBut I shall not anticipate the reader with further descriptions of this\\nkind, because I reserve them for a greater work, which is now almost\\nready for the press; containing a general description of this empire,\\nfrom its first erection, through a long series of princes; with a\\nparticular account of their wars and politics, laws, learning, and\\nreligion; their plants and animals; their peculiar manners and customs,\\nwith other matters very curious and useful; my chief design at present\\nbeing only to relate such events and transactions as happened to the\\npublic or to myself during a residence of about nine months in that\\nempire.\\n\\nOne morning, about a fortnight after I had obtained my liberty,\\nReldresal, principal secretary (as they style him) for private affairs,\\ncame to my house attended only by one servant. He ordered his coach to\\nwait at a distance, and desired I would give him an hour’s audience;\\nwhich I readily consented to, on account of his quality and personal\\nmerits, as well as of the many good offices he had done me during my\\nsolicitations at court. I offered to lie down that he might the more\\nconveniently reach my ear, but he chose rather to let me hold him in my\\nhand during our conversation. He began with compliments on my liberty;\\nsaid “he might pretend to some merit in it;” but, however, added, “that\\nif it had not been for the present situation of things at court,\\nperhaps I might not have obtained it so soon. For,” said he, “as\\nflourishing a condition as we may appear to be in to foreigners, we\\nlabour under two mighty evils: a violent faction at home, and the\\ndanger of an invasion, by a most potent enemy, from abroad. As to the\\nfirst, you are to understand, that for about seventy moons past there\\nhave been two struggling parties in this empire, under the names of\\n_Tramecksan_ and _Slamecksan_, from the high and low heels of their\\nshoes, by which they distinguish themselves. It is alleged, indeed,\\nthat the high heels are most agreeable to our ancient constitution;\\nbut, however this be, his majesty has determined to make use only of\\nlow heels in the administration of the government, and all offices in\\nthe gift of the crown, as you cannot but observe; and particularly that\\nhis majesty’s imperial heels are lower at least by a _drurr_ than any\\nof his court (_drurr_ is a measure about the fourteenth part of an\\ninch). The animosities between these two parties run so high, that they\\nwill neither eat, nor drink, nor talk with each other. We compute the\\n_Tramecksan_, or high heels, to exceed us in number; but the power is\\nwholly on our side. We apprehend his imperial highness, the heir to the\\ncrown, to have some tendency towards the high heels; at least we can\\nplainly discover that one of his heels is higher than the other, which\\ngives him a hobble in his gait. Now, in the midst of these intestine\\ndisquiets, we are threatened with an invasion from the island of\\nBlefuscu, which is the other great empire of the universe, almost as\\nlarge and powerful as this of his majesty. For as to what we have heard\\nyou affirm, that there are other kingdoms and states in the world\\ninhabited by human creatures as large as yourself, our philosophers are\\nin much doubt, and would rather conjecture that you dropped from the\\nmoon, or one of the stars; because it is certain, that a hundred\\nmortals of your bulk would in a short time destroy all the fruits and\\ncattle of his majesty’s dominions: besides, our histories of six\\nthousand moons make no mention of any other regions than the two great\\nempires of Lilliput and Blefuscu. Which two mighty powers have, as I\\nwas going to tell you, been engaged in a most obstinate war for\\nsix-and-thirty moons past. It began upon the following occasion. It is\\nallowed on all hands, that the primitive way of breaking eggs, before\\nwe eat them, was upon the larger end; but his present majesty’s\\ngrandfather, while he was a boy, going to eat an egg, and breaking it\\naccording to the ancient practice, happened to cut one of his fingers.\\nWhereupon the emperor his father published an edict, commanding all his\\nsubjects, upon great penalties, to break the smaller end of their eggs.\\nThe people so highly resented this law, that our histories tell us,\\nthere have been six rebellions raised on that account; wherein one\\nemperor lost his life, and another his crown. These civil commotions\\nwere constantly fomented by the monarchs of Blefuscu; and when they\\nwere quelled, the exiles always fled for refuge to that empire. It is\\ncomputed that eleven thousand persons have at several times suffered\\ndeath, rather than submit to break their eggs at the smaller end. Many\\nhundred large volumes have been published upon this controversy: but\\nthe books of the Big-endians have been long forbidden, and the whole\\nparty rendered incapable by law of holding employments. During the\\ncourse of these troubles, the emperors of Blefuscu did frequently\\nexpostulate by their ambassadors, accusing us of making a schism in\\nreligion, by offending against a fundamental doctrine of our great\\nprophet Lustrog, in the fifty-fourth chapter of the Blundecral (which\\nis their Alcoran). This, however, is thought to be a mere strain upon\\nthe text; for the words are these: ‘that all true believers break their\\neggs at the convenient end.’ And which is the convenient end, seems, in\\nmy humble opinion to be left to every man’s conscience, or at least in\\nthe power of the chief magistrate to determine. Now, the Big-endian\\nexiles have found so much credit in the emperor of Blefuscu’s court,\\nand so much private assistance and encouragement from their party here\\nat home, that a bloody war has been carried on between the two empires\\nfor six-and-thirty moons, with various success; during which time we\\nhave lost forty capital ships, and a much greater number of smaller\\nvessels, together with thirty thousand of our best seamen and soldiers;\\nand the damage received by the enemy is reckoned to be somewhat greater\\nthan ours. However, they have now equipped a numerous fleet, and are\\njust preparing to make a descent upon us; and his imperial majesty,\\nplacing great confidence in your valour and strength, has commanded me\\nto lay this account of his affairs before you.”\\n\\nI desired the secretary to present my humble duty to the emperor; and\\nto let him know, “that I thought it would not become me, who was a\\nforeigner, to interfere with parties; but I was ready, with the hazard\\nof my life, to defend his person and state against all invaders.”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\nThe author, by an extraordinary stratagem, prevents an invasion. A high\\ntitle of honour is conferred upon him. Ambassadors arrive from the\\nemperor of Blefuscu, and sue for peace. The empress’s apartment on fire\\nby an accident; the author instrumental in saving the rest of the\\npalace.\\n\\n\\nThe empire of Blefuscu is an island situated to the north-east of\\nLilliput, from which it is parted only by a channel of eight hundred\\nyards wide. I had not yet seen it, and upon this notice of an intended\\ninvasion, I avoided appearing on that side of the coast, for fear of\\nbeing discovered, by some of the enemy’s ships, who had received no\\nintelligence of me; all intercourse between the two empires having been\\nstrictly forbidden during the war, upon pain of death, and an embargo\\nlaid by our emperor upon all vessels whatsoever. I communicated to his\\nmajesty a project I had formed of seizing the enemy’s whole fleet;\\nwhich, as our scouts assured us, lay at anchor in the harbour, ready to\\nsail with the first fair wind. I consulted the most experienced seamen\\nupon the depth of the channel, which they had often plumbed; who told\\nme, that in the middle, at high-water, it was seventy _glumgluffs_\\ndeep, which is about six feet of European measure; and the rest of it\\nfifty _glumgluffs_ at most. I walked towards the north-east coast, over\\nagainst Blefuscu, where, lying down behind a hillock, I took out my\\nsmall perspective glass, and viewed the enemy’s fleet at anchor,\\nconsisting of about fifty men of war, and a great number of transports:\\nI then came back to my house, and gave orders (for which I had a\\nwarrant) for a great quantity of the strongest cable and bars of iron.\\nThe cable was about as thick as packthread and the bars of the length\\nand size of a knitting-needle. I trebled the cable to make it stronger,\\nand for the same reason I twisted three of the iron bars together,\\nbending the extremities into a hook. Having thus fixed fifty hooks to\\nas many cables, I went back to the north-east coast, and putting off my\\ncoat, shoes, and stockings, walked into the sea, in my leathern jerkin,\\nabout half an hour before high water. I waded with what haste I could,\\nand swam in the middle about thirty yards, till I felt ground. I\\narrived at the fleet in less than half an hour. The enemy was so\\nfrightened when they saw me, that they leaped out of their ships, and\\nswam to shore, where there could not be fewer than thirty thousand\\nsouls. I then took my tackling, and, fastening a hook to the hole at\\nthe prow of each, I tied all the cords together at the end. While I was\\nthus employed, the enemy discharged several thousand arrows, many of\\nwhich stuck in my hands and face, and, beside the excessive smart, gave\\nme much disturbance in my work. My greatest apprehension was for my\\neyes, which I should have infallibly lost, if I had not suddenly\\nthought of an expedient. I kept, among other little necessaries, a pair\\nof spectacles in a private pocket, which, as I observed before, had\\nescaped the emperor’s searchers. These I took out and fastened as\\nstrongly as I could upon my nose, and thus armed, went on boldly with\\nmy work, in spite of the enemy’s arrows, many of which struck against\\nthe glasses of my spectacles, but without any other effect, further\\nthan a little to discompose them. I had now fastened all the hooks,\\nand, taking the knot in my hand, began to pull; but not a ship would\\nstir, for they were all too fast held by their anchors, so that the\\nboldest part of my enterprise remained. I therefore let go the cord,\\nand leaving the hooks fixed to the ships, I resolutely cut with my\\nknife the cables that fastened the anchors, receiving about two hundred\\nshots in my face and hands; then I took up the knotted end of the\\ncables, to which my hooks were tied, and with great ease drew fifty of\\nthe enemy’s largest men of war after me.\\n\\nThe Blefuscudians, who had not the least imagination of what I\\nintended, were at first confounded with astonishment. They had seen me\\ncut the cables, and thought my design was only to let the ships run\\nadrift or fall foul on each other: but when they perceived the whole\\nfleet moving in order, and saw me pulling at the end, they set up such\\na scream of grief and despair as it is almost impossible to describe or\\nconceive. When I had got out of danger, I stopped awhile to pick out\\nthe arrows that stuck in my hands and face; and rubbed on some of the\\nsame ointment that was given me at my first arrival, as I have formerly\\nmentioned. I then took off my spectacles, and waiting about an hour,\\ntill the tide was a little fallen, I waded through the middle with my\\ncargo, and arrived safe at the royal port of Lilliput.\\n\\nThe emperor and his whole court stood on the shore, expecting the issue\\nof this great adventure. They saw the ships move forward in a large\\nhalf-moon, but could not discern me, who was up to my breast in water.\\nWhen I advanced to the middle of the channel, they were yet more in\\npain, because I was under water to my neck. The emperor concluded me to\\nbe drowned, and that the enemy’s fleet was approaching in a hostile\\nmanner: but he was soon eased of his fears; for the channel growing\\nshallower every step I made, I came in a short time within hearing, and\\nholding up the end of the cable, by which the fleet was fastened, I\\ncried in a loud voice, “Long live the most puissant king of Lilliput!”\\nThis great prince received me at my landing with all possible\\nencomiums, and created me a _nardac_ upon the spot, which is the\\nhighest title of honour among them.\\n\\nHis majesty desired I would take some other opportunity of bringing all\\nthe rest of his enemy’s ships into his ports. And so unmeasureable is\\nthe ambition of princes, that he seemed to think of nothing less than\\nreducing the whole empire of Blefuscu into a province, and governing\\nit, by a viceroy; of destroying the Big-endian exiles, and compelling\\nthat people to break the smaller end of their eggs, by which he would\\nremain the sole monarch of the whole world. But I endeavoured to divert\\nhim from this design, by many arguments drawn from the topics of policy\\nas well as justice; and I plainly protested, “that I would never be an\\ninstrument of bringing a free and brave people into slavery.” And, when\\nthe matter was debated in council, the wisest part of the ministry were\\nof my opinion.\\n\\nThis open bold declaration of mine was so opposite to the schemes and\\npolitics of his imperial majesty, that he could never forgive me. He\\nmentioned it in a very artful manner at council, where I was told that\\nsome of the wisest appeared, at least by their silence, to be of my\\nopinion; but others, who were my secret enemies, could not forbear some\\nexpressions which, by a side-wind, reflected on me. And from this time\\nbegan an intrigue between his majesty and a junto of ministers,\\nmaliciously bent against me, which broke out in less than two months,\\nand had like to have ended in my utter destruction. Of so little weight\\nare the greatest services to princes, when put into the balance with a\\nrefusal to gratify their passions.\\n\\nAbout three weeks after this exploit, there arrived a solemn embassy\\nfrom Blefuscu, with humble offers of a peace, which was soon concluded,\\nupon conditions very advantageous to our emperor, wherewith I shall not\\ntrouble the reader. There were six ambassadors, with a train of about\\nfive hundred persons, and their entry was very magnificent, suitable to\\nthe grandeur of their master, and the importance of their business.\\nWhen their treaty was finished, wherein I did them several good offices\\nby the credit I now had, or at least appeared to have, at court, their\\nexcellencies, who were privately told how much I had been their friend,\\nmade me a visit in form. They began with many compliments upon my\\nvalour and generosity, invited me to that kingdom in the emperor their\\nmaster’s name, and desired me to show them some proofs of my prodigious\\nstrength, of which they had heard so many wonders; wherein I readily\\nobliged them, but shall not trouble the reader with the particulars.\\n\\nWhen I had for some time entertained their excellencies, to their\\ninfinite satisfaction and surprise, I desired they would do me the\\nhonour to present my most humble respects to the emperor their master,\\nthe renown of whose virtues had so justly filled the whole world with\\nadmiration, and whose royal person I resolved to attend, before I\\nreturned to my own country. Accordingly, the next time I had the honour\\nto see our emperor, I desired his general license to wait on the\\nBlefuscudian monarch, which he was pleased to grant me, as I could\\nperceive, in a very cold manner; but could not guess the reason, till I\\nhad a whisper from a certain person, “that Flimnap and Bolgolam had\\nrepresented my intercourse with those ambassadors as a mark of\\ndisaffection;” from which I am sure my heart was wholly free. And this\\nwas the first time I began to conceive some imperfect idea of courts\\nand ministers.\\n\\nIt is to be observed, that these ambassadors spoke to me, by an\\ninterpreter, the languages of both empires differing as much from each\\nother as any two in Europe, and each nation priding itself upon the\\nantiquity, beauty, and energy of their own tongue, with an avowed\\ncontempt for that of their neighbour; yet our emperor, standing upon\\nthe advantage he had got by the seizure of their fleet, obliged them to\\ndeliver their credentials, and make their speech, in the Lilliputian\\ntongue. And it must be confessed, that from the great intercourse of\\ntrade and commerce between both realms, from the continual reception of\\nexiles which is mutual among them, and from the custom, in each empire,\\nto send their young nobility and richer gentry to the other, in order\\nto polish themselves by seeing the world, and understanding men and\\nmanners; there are few persons of distinction, or merchants, or seamen,\\nwho dwell in the maritime parts, but what can hold conversation in both\\ntongues; as I found some weeks after, when I went to pay my respects to\\nthe emperor of Blefuscu, which, in the midst of great misfortunes,\\nthrough the malice of my enemies, proved a very happy adventure to me,\\nas I shall relate in its proper place.\\n\\nThe reader may remember, that when I signed those articles upon which I\\nrecovered my liberty, there were some which I disliked, upon account of\\ntheir being too servile; neither could anything but an extreme\\nnecessity have forced me to submit. But being now a _nardac_ of the\\nhighest rank in that empire, such offices were looked upon as below my\\ndignity, and the emperor (to do him justice), never once mentioned them\\nto me. However, it was not long before I had an opportunity of doing\\nhis majesty, at least as I then thought, a most signal service. I was\\nalarmed at midnight with the cries of many hundred people at my door;\\nby which, being suddenly awaked, I was in some kind of terror. I heard\\nthe word _Burglum_ repeated incessantly: several of the emperor’s\\ncourt, making their way through the crowd, entreated me to come\\nimmediately to the palace, where her imperial majesty’s apartment was\\non fire, by the carelessness of a maid of honour, who fell asleep while\\nshe was reading a romance. I got up in an instant; and orders being\\ngiven to clear the way before me, and it being likewise a moonshine\\nnight, I made a shift to get to the palace without trampling on any of\\nthe people. I found they had already applied ladders to the walls of\\nthe apartment, and were well provided with buckets, but the water was\\nat some distance. These buckets were about the size of large thimbles,\\nand the poor people supplied me with them as fast as they could: but\\nthe flame was so violent that they did little good. I might easily have\\nstifled it with my coat, which I unfortunately left behind me for\\nhaste, and came away only in my leathern jerkin. The case seemed wholly\\ndesperate and deplorable; and this magnificent palace would have\\ninfallibly been burnt down to the ground, if, by a presence of mind\\nunusual to me, I had not suddenly thought of an expedient. I had, the\\nevening before, drunk plentifully of a most delicious wine called\\n_glimigrim_, (the Blefuscudians call it _flunec_, but ours is esteemed\\nthe better sort,) which is very diuretic. By the luckiest chance in the\\nworld, I had not discharged myself of any part of it. The heat I had\\ncontracted by coming very near the flames, and by labouring to quench\\nthem, made the wine begin to operate by urine; which I voided in such a\\nquantity, and applied so well to the proper places, that in three\\nminutes the fire was wholly extinguished, and the rest of that noble\\npile, which had cost so many ages in erecting, preserved from\\ndestruction.\\n\\nIt was now day-light, and I returned to my house without waiting to\\ncongratulate with the emperor: because, although I had done a very\\neminent piece of service, yet I could not tell how his majesty might\\nresent the manner by which I had performed it: for, by the fundamental\\nlaws of the realm, it is capital in any person, of what quality soever,\\nto make water within the precincts of the palace. But I was a little\\ncomforted by a message from his majesty, “that he would give orders to\\nthe grand justiciary for passing my pardon in form:” which, however, I\\ncould not obtain; and I was privately assured, “that the empress,\\nconceiving the greatest abhorrence of what I had done, removed to the\\nmost distant side of the court, firmly resolved that those buildings\\nshould never be repaired for her use: and, in the presence of her chief\\nconfidents could not forbear vowing revenge.”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\nOf the inhabitants of Lilliput; their learning, laws, and customs; the\\nmanner of educating their children. The author’s way of living in that\\ncountry. His vindication of a great lady.\\n\\n\\nAlthough I intend to leave the description of this empire to a\\nparticular treatise, yet, in the mean time, I am content to gratify the\\ncurious reader with some general ideas. As the common size of the\\nnatives is somewhat under six inches high, so there is an exact\\nproportion in all other animals, as well as plants and trees: for\\ninstance, the tallest horses and oxen are between four and five inches\\nin height, the sheep an inch and half, more or less: their geese about\\nthe bigness of a sparrow, and so the several gradations downwards till\\nyou come to the smallest, which to my sight, were almost invisible; but\\nnature has adapted the eyes of the Lilliputians to all objects proper\\nfor their view: they see with great exactness, but at no great\\ndistance. And, to show the sharpness of their sight towards objects\\nthat are near, I have been much pleased with observing a cook pulling a\\nlark, which was not so large as a common fly; and a young girl\\nthreading an invisible needle with invisible silk. Their tallest trees\\nare about seven feet high: I mean some of those in the great royal\\npark, the tops whereof I could but just reach with my fist clenched.\\nThe other vegetables are in the same proportion; but this I leave to\\nthe reader’s imagination.\\n\\nI shall say but little at present of their learning, which, for many\\nages, has flourished in all its branches among them: but their manner\\nof writing is very peculiar, being neither from the left to the right,\\nlike the Europeans, nor from the right to the left, like the Arabians,\\nnor from up to down, like the Chinese, but aslant, from one corner of\\nthe paper to the other, like ladies in England.\\n\\nThey bury their dead with their heads directly downward, because they\\nhold an opinion, that in eleven thousand moons they are all to rise\\nagain; in which period the earth (which they conceive to be flat) will\\nturn upside down, and by this means they shall, at their resurrection,\\nbe found ready standing on their feet. The learned among them confess\\nthe absurdity of this doctrine; but the practice still continues, in\\ncompliance to the vulgar.\\n\\nThere are some laws and customs in this empire very peculiar; and if\\nthey were not so directly contrary to those of my own dear country, I\\nshould be tempted to say a little in their justification. It is only to\\nbe wished they were as well executed. The first I shall mention,\\nrelates to informers. All crimes against the state, are punished here\\nwith the utmost severity; but, if the person accused makes his\\ninnocence plainly to appear upon his trial, the accuser is immediately\\nput to an ignominious death; and out of his goods or lands the innocent\\nperson is quadruply recompensed for the loss of his time, for the\\ndanger he underwent, for the hardship of his imprisonment, and for all\\nthe charges he has been at in making his defence; or, if that fund be\\ndeficient, it is largely supplied by the crown. The emperor also\\nconfers on him some public mark of his favour, and proclamation is made\\nof his innocence through the whole city.\\n\\nThey look upon fraud as a greater crime than theft, and therefore\\nseldom fail to punish it with death; for they allege, that care and\\nvigilance, with a very common understanding, may preserve a man’s goods\\nfrom thieves, but honesty has no defence against superior cunning; and,\\nsince it is necessary that there should be a perpetual intercourse of\\nbuying and selling, and dealing upon credit, where fraud is permitted\\nand connived at, or has no law to punish it, the honest dealer is\\nalways undone, and the knave gets the advantage. I remember, when I was\\nonce interceding with the emperor for a criminal who had wronged his\\nmaster of a great sum of money, which he had received by order and ran\\naway with; and happening to tell his majesty, by way of extenuation,\\nthat it was only a breach of trust, the emperor thought it monstrous in\\nme to offer as a defence the greatest aggravation of the crime; and\\ntruly I had little to say in return, farther than the common answer,\\nthat different nations had different customs; for, I confess, I was\\nheartily ashamed. [330]\\n\\nAlthough we usually call reward and punishment the two hinges upon\\nwhich all government turns, yet I could never observe this maxim to be\\nput in practice by any nation except that of Lilliput. Whoever can\\nthere bring sufficient proof, that he has strictly observed the laws of\\nhis country for seventy-three moons, has a claim to certain privileges,\\naccording to his quality or condition of life, with a proportionable\\nsum of money out of a fund appropriated for that use: he likewise\\nacquires the title of _snilpall_, or legal, which is added to his name,\\nbut does not descend to his posterity. And these people thought it a\\nprodigious defect of policy among us, when I told them that our laws\\nwere enforced only by penalties, without any mention of reward. It is\\nupon this account that the image of Justice, in their courts of\\njudicature, is formed with six eyes, two before, as many behind, and on\\neach side one, to signify circumspection; with a bag of gold open in\\nher right hand, and a sword sheathed in her left, to show she is more\\ndisposed to reward than to punish.\\n\\nIn choosing persons for all employments, they have more regard to good\\nmorals than to great abilities; for, since government is necessary to\\nmankind, they believe, that the common size of human understanding is\\nfitted to some station or other; and that Providence never intended to\\nmake the management of public affairs a mystery to be comprehended only\\nby a few persons of sublime genius, of which there seldom are three\\nborn in an age: but they suppose truth, justice, temperance, and the\\nlike, to be in every man’s power; the practice of which virtues,\\nassisted by experience and a good intention, would qualify any man for\\nthe service of his country, except where a course of study is required.\\nBut they thought the want of moral virtues was so far from being\\nsupplied by superior endowments of the mind, that employments could\\nnever be put into such dangerous hands as those of persons so\\nqualified; and, at least, that the mistakes committed by ignorance, in\\na virtuous disposition, would never be of such fatal consequence to the\\npublic weal, as the practices of a man, whose inclinations led him to\\nbe corrupt, and who had great abilities to manage, to multiply, and\\ndefend his corruptions.\\n\\nIn like manner, the disbelief of a Divine Providence renders a man\\nincapable of holding any public station; for, since kings avow\\nthemselves to be the deputies of Providence, the Lilliputians think\\nnothing can be more absurd than for a prince to employ such men as\\ndisown the authority under which he acts.\\n\\nIn relating these and the following laws, I would only be understood to\\nmean the original institutions, and not the most scandalous\\ncorruptions, into which these people are fallen by the degenerate\\nnature of man. For, as to that infamous practice of acquiring great\\nemployments by dancing on the ropes, or badges of favour and\\ndistinction by leaping over sticks and creeping under them, the reader\\nis to observe, that they were first introduced by the grandfather of\\nthe emperor now reigning, and grew to the present height by the gradual\\nincrease of party and faction.\\n\\nIngratitude is among them a capital crime, as we read it to have been\\nin some other countries: for they reason thus; that whoever makes ill\\nreturns to his benefactor, must needs be a common enemy to the rest of\\nmankind, from whom he has received no obligation, and therefore such a\\nman is not fit to live.\\n\\nTheir notions relating to the duties of parents and children differ\\nextremely from ours. For, since the conjunction of male and female is\\nfounded upon the great law of nature, in order to propagate and\\ncontinue the species, the Lilliputians will needs have it, that men and\\nwomen are joined together, like other animals, by the motives of\\nconcupiscence; and that their tenderness towards their young proceeds\\nfrom the like natural principle: for which reason they will never allow\\nthat a child is under any obligation to his father for begetting him,\\nor to his mother for bringing him into the world; which, considering\\nthe miseries of human life, was neither a benefit in itself, nor\\nintended so by his parents, whose thoughts, in their love encounters,\\nwere otherwise employed. Upon these, and the like reasonings, their\\nopinion is, that parents are the last of all others to be trusted with\\nthe education of their own children; and therefore they have in every\\ntown public nurseries, where all parents, except cottagers and\\nlabourers, are obliged to send their infants of both sexes to be reared\\nand educated, when they come to the age of twenty moons, at which time\\nthey are supposed to have some rudiments of docility. These schools are\\nof several kinds, suited to different qualities, and both sexes. They\\nhave certain professors well skilled in preparing children for such a\\ncondition of life as befits the rank of their parents, and their own\\ncapacities, as well as inclinations. I shall first say something of the\\nmale nurseries, and then of the female.\\n\\nThe nurseries for males of noble or eminent birth, are provided with\\ngrave and learned professors, and their several deputies. The clothes\\nand food of the children are plain and simple. They are bred up in the\\nprinciples of honour, justice, courage, modesty, clemency, religion,\\nand love of their country; they are always employed in some business,\\nexcept in the times of eating and sleeping, which are very short, and\\ntwo hours for diversions consisting of bodily exercises. They are\\ndressed by men till four years of age, and then are obliged to dress\\nthemselves, although their quality be ever so great; and the women\\nattendant, who are aged proportionably to ours at fifty, perform only\\nthe most menial offices. They are never suffered to converse with\\nservants, but go together in smaller or greater numbers to take their\\ndiversions, and always in the presence of a professor, or one of his\\ndeputies; whereby they avoid those early bad impressions of folly and\\nvice, to which our children are subject. Their parents are suffered to\\nsee them only twice a year; the visit is to last but an hour; they are\\nallowed to kiss the child at meeting and parting; but a professor, who\\nalways stands by on those occasions, will not suffer them to whisper,\\nor use any fondling expressions, or bring any presents of toys,\\nsweetmeats, and the like.\\n\\nThe pension from each family for the education and entertainment of a\\nchild, upon failure of due payment, is levied by the emperor’s\\nofficers.\\n\\nThe nurseries for children of ordinary gentlemen, merchants, traders,\\nand handicrafts, are managed proportionably after the same manner; only\\nthose designed for trades are put out apprentices at eleven years old,\\nwhereas those of persons of quality continue in their exercises till\\nfifteen, which answers to twenty-one with us: but the confinement is\\ngradually lessened for the last three years.\\n\\nIn the female nurseries, the young girls of quality are educated much\\nlike the males, only they are dressed by orderly servants of their own\\nsex; but always in the presence of a professor or deputy, till they\\ncome to dress themselves, which is at five years old. And if it be\\nfound that these nurses ever presume to entertain the girls with\\nfrightful or foolish stories, or the common follies practised by\\nchambermaids among us, they are publicly whipped thrice about the city,\\nimprisoned for a year, and banished for life to the most desolate part\\nof the country. Thus the young ladies are as much ashamed of being\\ncowards and fools as the men, and despise all personal ornaments,\\nbeyond decency and cleanliness: neither did I perceive any difference\\nin their education made by their difference of sex, only that the\\nexercises of the females were not altogether so robust; and that some\\nrules were given them relating to domestic life, and a smaller compass\\nof learning was enjoined them: for their maxim is, that among peoples\\nof quality, a wife should be always a reasonable and agreeable\\ncompanion, because she cannot always be young. When the girls are\\ntwelve years old, which among them is the marriageable age, their\\nparents or guardians take them home, with great expressions of\\ngratitude to the professors, and seldom without tears of the young lady\\nand her companions.\\n\\nIn the nurseries of females of the meaner sort, the children are\\ninstructed in all kinds of works proper for their sex, and their\\nseveral degrees: those intended for apprentices are dismissed at seven\\nyears old, the rest are kept to eleven.\\n\\nThe meaner families who have children at these nurseries, are obliged,\\nbesides their annual pension, which is as low as possible, to return to\\nthe steward of the nursery a small monthly share of their gettings, to\\nbe a portion for the child; and therefore all parents are limited in\\ntheir expenses by the law. For the Lilliputians think nothing can be\\nmore unjust, than for people, in subservience to their own appetites,\\nto bring children into the world, and leave the burthen of supporting\\nthem on the public. As to persons of quality, they give security to\\nappropriate a certain sum for each child, suitable to their condition;\\nand these funds are always managed with good husbandry and the most\\nexact justice.\\n\\nThe cottagers and labourers keep their children at home, their business\\nbeing only to till and cultivate the earth, and therefore their\\neducation is of little consequence to the public: but the old and\\ndiseased among them are supported by hospitals; for begging is a trade\\nunknown in this empire.\\n\\nAnd here it may, perhaps, divert the curious reader, to give some\\naccount of my domestics, and my manner of living in this country,\\nduring a residence of nine months, and thirteen days. Having a head\\nmechanically turned, and being likewise forced by necessity, I had made\\nfor myself a table and chair convenient enough, out of the largest\\ntrees in the royal park. Two hundred sempstresses were employed to make\\nme shirts, and linen for my bed and table, all of the strongest and\\ncoarsest kind they could get; which, however, they were forced to quilt\\ntogether in several folds, for the thickest was some degrees finer than\\nlawn. Their linen is usually three inches wide, and three feet make a\\npiece. The sempstresses took my measure as I lay on the ground, one\\nstanding at my neck, and another at my mid-leg, with a strong cord\\nextended, that each held by the end, while a third measured the length\\nof the cord with a rule of an inch long. Then they measured my right\\nthumb, and desired no more; for by a mathematical computation, that\\ntwice round the thumb is once round the wrist, and so on to the neck\\nand the waist, and by the help of my old shirt, which I displayed on\\nthe ground before them for a pattern, they fitted me exactly. Three\\nhundred tailors were employed in the same manner to make me clothes;\\nbut they had another contrivance for taking my measure. I kneeled down,\\nand they raised a ladder from the ground to my neck; upon this ladder\\none of them mounted, and let fall a plumb-line from my collar to the\\nfloor, which just answered the length of my coat: but my waist and arms\\nI measured myself. When my clothes were finished, which was done in my\\nhouse (for the largest of theirs would not have been able to hold\\nthem), they looked like the patch-work made by the ladies in England,\\nonly that mine were all of a colour.\\n\\nI had three hundred cooks to dress my victuals, in little convenient\\nhuts built about my house, where they and their families lived, and\\nprepared me two dishes a-piece. I took up twenty waiters in my hand,\\nand placed them on the table: a hundred more attended below on the\\nground, some with dishes of meat, and some with barrels of wine and\\nother liquors slung on their shoulders; all which the waiters above\\ndrew up, as I wanted, in a very ingenious manner, by certain cords, as\\nwe draw the bucket up a well in Europe. A dish of their meat was a good\\nmouthful, and a barrel of their liquor a reasonable draught. Their\\nmutton yields to ours, but their beef is excellent. I have had a\\nsirloin so large, that I have been forced to make three bites of it;\\nbut this is rare. My servants were astonished to see me eat it, bones\\nand all, as in our country we do the leg of a lark. Their geese and\\nturkeys I usually ate at a mouthful, and I confess they far exceed\\nours. Of their smaller fowl I could take up twenty or thirty at the end\\nof my knife.\\n\\nOne day his imperial majesty, being informed of my way of living,\\ndesired “that himself and his royal consort, with the young princes of\\nthe blood of both sexes, might have the happiness,” as he was pleased\\nto call it, “of dining with me.” They came accordingly, and I placed\\nthem in chairs of state, upon my table, just over against me, with\\ntheir guards about them. Flimnap, the lord high treasurer, attended\\nthere likewise with his white staff; and I observed he often looked on\\nme with a sour countenance, which I would not seem to regard, but ate\\nmore than usual, in honour to my dear country, as well as to fill the\\ncourt with admiration. I have some private reasons to believe, that\\nthis visit from his majesty gave Flimnap an opportunity of doing me ill\\noffices to his master. That minister had always been my secret enemy,\\nthough he outwardly caressed me more than was usual to the moroseness\\nof his nature. He represented to the emperor “the low condition of his\\ntreasury; that he was forced to take up money at a great discount; that\\nexchequer bills would not circulate under nine per cent. below par;\\nthat I had cost his majesty above a million and a half of _sprugs_”\\n(their greatest gold coin, about the bigness of a spangle) “and, upon\\nthe whole, that it would be advisable in the emperor to take the first\\nfair occasion of dismissing me.”\\n\\nI am here obliged to vindicate the reputation of an excellent lady, who\\nwas an innocent sufferer upon my account. The treasurer took a fancy to\\nbe jealous of his wife, from the malice of some evil tongues, who\\ninformed him that her grace had taken a violent affection for my\\nperson; and the court scandal ran for some time, that she once came\\nprivately to my lodging. This I solemnly declare to be a most infamous\\nfalsehood, without any grounds, further than that her grace was pleased\\nto treat me with all innocent marks of freedom and friendship. I own\\nshe came often to my house, but always publicly, nor ever without three\\nmore in the coach, who were usually her sister and young daughter, and\\nsome particular acquaintance; but this was common to many other ladies\\nof the court. And I still appeal to my servants round, whether they at\\nany time saw a coach at my door, without knowing what persons were in\\nit. On those occasions, when a servant had given me notice, my custom\\nwas to go immediately to the door, and, after paying my respects, to\\ntake up the coach and two horses very carefully in my hands (for, if\\nthere were six horses, the postillion always unharnessed four,) and\\nplace them on a table, where I had fixed a movable rim quite round, of\\nfive inches high, to prevent accidents. And I have often had four\\ncoaches and horses at once on my table, full of company, while I sat in\\nmy chair, leaning my face towards them; and when I was engaged with one\\nset, the coachmen would gently drive the others round my table. I have\\npassed many an afternoon very agreeably in these conversations. But I\\ndefy the treasurer, or his two informers (I will name them, and let\\nthem make the best of it) Clustril and Drunlo, to prove that any person\\never came to me _incognito_, except the secretary Reldresal, who was\\nsent by express command of his imperial majesty, as I have before\\nrelated. I should not have dwelt so long upon this particular, if it\\nhad not been a point wherein the reputation of a great lady is so\\nnearly concerned, to say nothing of my own; though I then had the\\nhonour to be a _nardac_, which the treasurer himself is not; for all\\nthe world knows, that he is only a _glumglum_, a title inferior by one\\ndegree, as that of a marquis is to a duke in England; yet I allow he\\npreceded me in right of his post. These false informations, which I\\nafterwards came to the knowledge of by an accident not proper to\\nmention, made the treasurer show his lady for some time an ill\\ncountenance, and me a worse; and although he was at last undeceived and\\nreconciled to her, yet I lost all credit with him, and found my\\ninterest decline very fast with the emperor himself, who was, indeed,\\ntoo much governed by that favourite.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\nThe author, being informed of a design to accuse him of high-treason,\\nmakes his escape to Blefuscu. His reception there.\\n\\n\\nBefore I proceed to give an account of my leaving this kingdom, it may\\nbe proper to inform the reader of a private intrigue which had been for\\ntwo months forming against me.\\n\\nI had been hitherto, all my life, a stranger to courts, for which I was\\nunqualified by the meanness of my condition. I had indeed heard and\\nread enough of the dispositions of great princes and ministers, but\\nnever expected to have found such terrible effects of them, in so\\nremote a country, governed, as I thought, by very different maxims from\\nthose in Europe.\\n\\nWhen I was just preparing to pay my attendance on the emperor of\\nBlefuscu, a considerable person at court (to whom I had been very\\nserviceable, at a time when he lay under the highest displeasure of his\\nimperial majesty) came to my house very privately at night, in a close\\nchair, and, without sending his name, desired admittance. The chairmen\\nwere dismissed; I put the chair, with his lordship in it, into my\\ncoat-pocket: and, giving orders to a trusty servant, to say I was\\nindisposed and gone to sleep, I fastened the door of my house, placed\\nthe chair on the table, according to my usual custom, and sat down by\\nit. After the common salutations were over, observing his lordship’s\\ncountenance full of concern, and inquiring into the reason, he desired\\n“I would hear him with patience, in a matter that highly concerned my\\nhonour and my life.” His speech was to the following effect, for I took\\nnotes of it as soon as he left me:—\\n\\n“You are to know,” said he, “that several committees of council have\\nbeen lately called, in the most private manner, on your account; and it\\nis but two days since his majesty came to a full resolution.\\n\\n“You are very sensible that Skyresh Bolgolam” (_galbet_, or\\nhigh-admiral) “has been your mortal enemy, almost ever since your\\narrival. His original reasons I know not; but his hatred is increased\\nsince your great success against Blefuscu, by which his glory as\\nadmiral is much obscured. This lord, in conjunction with Flimnap the\\nhigh-treasurer, whose enmity against you is notorious on account of his\\nlady, Limtoc the general, Lalcon the chamberlain, and Balmuff the grand\\njusticiary, have prepared articles of impeachment against you, for\\ntreason and other capital crimes.”\\n\\nThis preface made me so impatient, being conscious of my own merits and\\ninnocence, that I was going to interrupt him; when he entreated me to\\nbe silent, and thus proceeded:—\\n\\n“Out of gratitude for the favours you have done me, I procured\\ninformation of the whole proceedings, and a copy of the articles;\\nwherein I venture my head for your service.\\n\\n\\n“‘_Articles of Impeachment against_ QUINBUS FLESTRIN, (_the\\nMan-Mountain_.)\\n\\nArticle I.\\n\\n\\n“‘Whereas, by a statute made in the reign of his imperial majesty Calin\\nDeffar Plune, it is enacted, that, whoever shall make water within the\\nprecincts of the royal palace, shall be liable to the pains and\\npenalties of high-treason; notwithstanding, the said Quinbus Flestrin,\\nin open breach of the said law, under colour of extinguishing the fire\\nkindled in the apartment of his majesty’s most dear imperial consort,\\ndid maliciously, traitorously, and devilishly, by discharge of his\\nurine, put out the said fire kindled in the said apartment, lying and\\nbeing within the precincts of the said royal palace, against the\\nstatute in that case provided, etc. against the duty, etc.\\n\\nArticle II.\\n\\n\\n“‘That the said Quinbus Flestrin, having brought the imperial fleet of\\nBlefuscu into the royal port, and being afterwards commanded by his\\nimperial majesty to seize all the other ships of the said empire of\\nBlefuscu, and reduce that empire to a province, to be governed by a\\nviceroy from hence, and to destroy and put to death, not only all the\\nBig-endian exiles, but likewise all the people of that empire who would\\nnot immediately forsake the Big-endian heresy, he, the said Flestrin,\\nlike a false traitor against his most auspicious, serene, imperial\\nmajesty, did petition to be excused from the said service, upon\\npretence of unwillingness to force the consciences, or destroy the\\nliberties and lives of an innocent people.\\n\\nArticle III.\\n\\n\\n“‘That, whereas certain ambassadors arrived from the Court of Blefuscu,\\nto sue for peace in his majesty’s court, he, the said Flestrin, did,\\nlike a false traitor, aid, abet, comfort, and divert, the said\\nambassadors, although he knew them to be servants to a prince who was\\nlately an open enemy to his imperial majesty, and in an open war\\nagainst his said majesty.\\n\\nArticle IV.\\n\\n\\n“‘That the said Quinbus Flestrin, contrary to the duty of a faithful\\nsubject, is now preparing to make a voyage to the court and empire of\\nBlefuscu, for which he has received only verbal license from his\\nimperial majesty; and, under colour of the said license, does falsely\\nand traitorously intend to take the said voyage, and thereby to aid,\\ncomfort, and abet the emperor of Blefuscu, so lately an enemy, and in\\nopen war with his imperial majesty aforesaid.’\\n\\n\\n“There are some other articles; but these are the most important, of\\nwhich I have read you an abstract.\\n\\n“In the several debates upon this impeachment, it must be confessed\\nthat his majesty gave many marks of his great lenity; often urging the\\nservices you had done him, and endeavouring to extenuate your crimes.\\nThe treasurer and admiral insisted that you should be put to the most\\npainful and ignominious death, by setting fire to your house at night,\\nand the general was to attend with twenty thousand men, armed with\\npoisoned arrows, to shoot you on the face and hands. Some of your\\nservants were to have private orders to strew a poisonous juice on your\\nshirts and sheets, which would soon make you tear your own flesh, and\\ndie in the utmost torture. The general came into the same opinion; so\\nthat for a long time there was a majority against you; but his majesty\\nresolving, if possible, to spare your life, at last brought off the\\nchamberlain.\\n\\n“Upon this incident, Reldresal, principal secretary for private\\naffairs, who always approved himself your true friend, was commanded by\\nthe emperor to deliver his opinion, which he accordingly did; and\\ntherein justified the good thoughts you have of him. He allowed your\\ncrimes to be great, but that still there was room for mercy, the most\\ncommendable virtue in a prince, and for which his majesty was so justly\\ncelebrated. He said, the friendship between you and him was so well\\nknown to the world, that perhaps the most honourable board might think\\nhim partial; however, in obedience to the command he had received, he\\nwould freely offer his sentiments. That if his majesty, in\\nconsideration of your services, and pursuant to his own merciful\\ndisposition, would please to spare your life, and only give orders to\\nput out both your eyes, he humbly conceived, that by this expedient\\njustice might in some measure be satisfied, and all the world would\\napplaud the lenity of the emperor, as well as the fair and generous\\nproceedings of those who have the honour to be his counsellors. That\\nthe loss of your eyes would be no impediment to your bodily strength,\\nby which you might still be useful to his majesty; that blindness is an\\naddition to courage, by concealing dangers from us; that the fear you\\nhad for your eyes, was the greatest difficulty in bringing over the\\nenemy’s fleet, and it would be sufficient for you to see by the eyes of\\nthe ministers, since the greatest princes do no more.\\n\\n“This proposal was received with the utmost disapprobation by the whole\\nboard. Bolgolam, the admiral, could not preserve his temper, but,\\nrising up in fury, said, he wondered how the secretary durst presume to\\ngive his opinion for preserving the life of a traitor; that the\\nservices you had performed were, by all true reasons of state, the\\ngreat aggravation of your crimes; that you, who were able to extinguish\\nthe fire by discharge of urine in her majesty’s apartment (which he\\nmentioned with horror), might, at another time, raise an inundation by\\nthe same means, to drown the whole palace; and the same strength which\\nenabled you to bring over the enemy’s fleet, might serve, upon the\\nfirst discontent, to carry it back; that he had good reasons to think\\nyou were a Big-endian in your heart; and, as treason begins in the\\nheart, before it appears in overt acts, so he accused you as a traitor\\non that account, and therefore insisted you should be put to death.\\n\\n“The treasurer was of the same opinion: he showed to what straits his\\nmajesty’s revenue was reduced, by the charge of maintaining you, which\\nwould soon grow insupportable; that the secretary’s expedient of\\nputting out your eyes, was so far from being a remedy against this\\nevil, that it would probably increase it, as is manifest from the\\ncommon practice of blinding some kind of fowls, after which they fed\\nthe faster, and grew sooner fat; that his sacred majesty and the\\ncouncil, who are your judges, were, in their own consciences, fully\\nconvinced of your guilt, which was a sufficient argument to condemn you\\nto death, without the formal proofs required by the strict letter of\\nthe law.\\n\\n“But his imperial majesty, fully determined against capital punishment,\\nwas graciously pleased to say, that since the council thought the loss\\nof your eyes too easy a censure, some other way may be inflicted\\nhereafter. And your friend the secretary, humbly desiring to be heard\\nagain, in answer to what the treasurer had objected, concerning the\\ngreat charge his majesty was at in maintaining you, said, that his\\nexcellency, who had the sole disposal of the emperor’s revenue, might\\neasily provide against that evil, by gradually lessening your\\nestablishment; by which, for want of sufficient food, you would grow\\nweak and faint, and lose your appetite, and consequently, decay, and\\nconsume in a few months; neither would the stench of your carcass be\\nthen so dangerous, when it should become more than half diminished; and\\nimmediately upon your death five or six thousand of his majesty’s\\nsubjects might, in two or three days, cut your flesh from your bones,\\ntake it away by cart-loads, and bury it in distant parts, to prevent\\ninfection, leaving the skeleton as a monument of admiration to\\nposterity.\\n\\n“Thus, by the great friendship of the secretary, the whole affair was\\ncompromised. It was strictly enjoined, that the project of starving you\\nby degrees should be kept a secret; but the sentence of putting out\\nyour eyes was entered on the books; none dissenting, except Bolgolam\\nthe admiral, who, being a creature of the empress, was perpetually\\ninstigated by her majesty to insist upon your death, she having borne\\nperpetual malice against you, on account of that infamous and illegal\\nmethod you took to extinguish the fire in her apartment.\\n\\n“In three days your friend the secretary will be directed to come to\\nyour house, and read before you the articles of impeachment; and then\\nto signify the great lenity and favour of his majesty and council,\\nwhereby you are only condemned to the loss of your eyes, which his\\nmajesty does not question you will gratefully and humbly submit to; and\\ntwenty of his majesty’s surgeons will attend, in order to see the\\noperation well performed, by discharging very sharp-pointed arrows into\\nthe balls of your eyes, as you lie on the ground.\\n\\n“I leave to your prudence what measures you will take; and to avoid\\nsuspicion, I must immediately return in as private a manner as I came.”\\n\\nHis lordship did so; and I remained alone, under many doubts and\\nperplexities of mind.\\n\\nIt was a custom introduced by this prince and his ministry (very\\ndifferent, as I have been assured, from the practice of former times,)\\nthat after the court had decreed any cruel execution, either to gratify\\nthe monarch’s resentment, or the malice of a favourite, the emperor\\nalways made a speech to his whole council, expressing his great lenity\\nand tenderness, as qualities known and confessed by all the world. This\\nspeech was immediately published throughout the kingdom; nor did any\\nthing terrify the people so much as those encomiums on his majesty’s\\nmercy; because it was observed, that the more these praises were\\nenlarged and insisted on, the more inhuman was the punishment, and the\\nsufferer more innocent. Yet, as to myself, I must confess, having never\\nbeen designed for a courtier, either by my birth or education, I was so\\nill a judge of things, that I could not discover the lenity and favour\\nof this sentence, but conceived it (perhaps erroneously) rather to be\\nrigorous than gentle. I sometimes thought of standing my trial, for,\\nalthough I could not deny the facts alleged in the several articles,\\nyet I hoped they would admit of some extenuation. But having in my life\\nperused many state-trials, which I ever observed to terminate as the\\njudges thought fit to direct, I durst not rely on so dangerous a\\ndecision, in so critical a juncture, and against such powerful enemies.\\nOnce I was strongly bent upon resistance, for, while I had liberty the\\nwhole strength of that empire could hardly subdue me, and I might\\neasily with stones pelt the metropolis to pieces; but I soon rejected\\nthat project with horror, by remembering the oath I had made to the\\nemperor, the favours I received from him, and the high title of\\n_nardac_ he conferred upon me. Neither had I so soon learned the\\ngratitude of courtiers, to persuade myself, that his majesty’s present\\nseverities acquitted me of all past obligations.\\n\\nAt last, I fixed upon a resolution, for which it is probable I may\\nincur some censure, and not unjustly; for I confess I owe the\\npreserving of my eyes, and consequently my liberty, to my own great\\nrashness and want of experience; because, if I had then known the\\nnature of princes and ministers, which I have since observed in many\\nother courts, and their methods of treating criminals less obnoxious\\nthan myself, I should, with great alacrity and readiness, have\\nsubmitted to so easy a punishment. But hurried on by the precipitancy\\nof youth, and having his imperial majesty’s license to pay my\\nattendance upon the emperor of Blefuscu, I took this opportunity,\\nbefore the three days were elapsed, to send a letter to my friend the\\nsecretary, signifying my resolution of setting out that morning for\\nBlefuscu, pursuant to the leave I had got; and, without waiting for an\\nanswer, I went to that side of the island where our fleet lay. I seized\\na large man of war, tied a cable to the prow, and, lifting up the\\nanchors, I stripped myself, put my clothes (together with my coverlet,\\nwhich I carried under my arm) into the vessel, and, drawing it after\\nme, between wading and swimming arrived at the royal port of Blefuscu,\\nwhere the people had long expected me: they lent me two guides to\\ndirect me to the capital city, which is of the same name. I held them\\nin my hands, till I came within two hundred yards of the gate, and\\ndesired them “to signify my arrival to one of the secretaries, and let\\nhim know, I there waited his majesty’s command.” I had an answer in\\nabout an hour, “that his majesty, attended by the royal family, and\\ngreat officers of the court, was coming out to receive me.” I advanced\\na hundred yards. The emperor and his train alighted from their horses,\\nthe empress and ladies from their coaches, and I did not perceive they\\nwere in any fright or concern. I lay on the ground to kiss his\\nmajesty’s and the empress’s hands. I told his majesty, “that I was come\\naccording to my promise, and with the license of the emperor my master,\\nto have the honour of seeing so mighty a monarch, and to offer him any\\nservice in my power, consistent with my duty to my own prince;” not\\nmentioning a word of my disgrace, because I had hitherto no regular\\ninformation of it, and might suppose myself wholly ignorant of any such\\ndesign; neither could I reasonably conceive that the emperor would\\ndiscover the secret, while I was out of his power; wherein, however, it\\nsoon appeared I was deceived.\\n\\nI shall not trouble the reader with the particular account of my\\nreception at this court, which was suitable to the generosity of so\\ngreat a prince; nor of the difficulties I was in for want of a house\\nand bed, being forced to lie on the ground, wrapped up in my coverlet.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\nThe author, by a lucky accident, finds means to leave Blefuscu; and,\\nafter some difficulties, returns safe to his native country.\\n\\n\\nThree days after my arrival, walking out of curiosity to the north-east\\ncoast of the island, I observed, about half a league off in the sea,\\nsomewhat that looked like a boat overturned. I pulled off my shoes and\\nstockings, and, wading two or three hundred yards, I found the object\\nto approach nearer by force of the tide; and then plainly saw it to be\\na real boat, which I supposed might by some tempest have been driven\\nfrom a ship. Whereupon, I returned immediately towards the city, and\\ndesired his imperial majesty to lend me twenty of the tallest vessels\\nhe had left, after the loss of his fleet, and three thousand seamen,\\nunder the command of his vice-admiral. This fleet sailed round, while I\\nwent back the shortest way to the coast, where I first discovered the\\nboat. I found the tide had driven it still nearer. The seamen were all\\nprovided with cordage, which I had beforehand twisted to a sufficient\\nstrength. When the ships came up, I stripped myself, and waded till I\\ncame within a hundred yards of the boat, after which I was forced to\\nswim till I got up to it. The seamen threw me the end of the cord,\\nwhich I fastened to a hole in the fore-part of the boat, and the other\\nend to a man of war; but I found all my labour to little purpose; for,\\nbeing out of my depth, I was not able to work. In this necessity I was\\nforced to swim behind, and push the boat forward, as often as I could,\\nwith one of my hands; and the tide favouring me, I advanced so far that\\nI could just hold up my chin and feel the ground. I rested two or three\\nminutes, and then gave the boat another shove, and so on, till the sea\\nwas no higher than my arm-pits; and now, the most laborious part being\\nover, I took out my other cables, which were stowed in one of the\\nships, and fastened them first to the boat, and then to nine of the\\nvessels which attended me; the wind being favourable, the seamen towed,\\nand I shoved, until we arrived within forty yards of the shore; and,\\nwaiting till the tide was out, I got dry to the boat, and by the\\nassistance of two thousand men, with ropes and engines, I made a shift\\nto turn it on its bottom, and found it was but little damaged.\\n\\nI shall not trouble the reader with the difficulties I was under, by\\nthe help of certain paddles, which cost me ten days making, to get my\\nboat to the royal port of Blefuscu, where a mighty concourse of people\\nappeared upon my arrival, full of wonder at the sight of so prodigious\\na vessel. I told the emperor “that my good fortune had thrown this boat\\nin my way, to carry me to some place whence I might return into my\\nnative country; and begged his majesty’s orders for getting materials\\nto fit it up, together with his license to depart;” which, after some\\nkind expostulations, he was pleased to grant.\\n\\nI did very much wonder, in all this time, not to have heard of any\\nexpress relating to me from our emperor to the court of Blefuscu. But I\\nwas afterward given privately to understand, that his imperial majesty,\\nnever imagining I had the least notice of his designs, believed I was\\nonly gone to Blefuscu in performance of my promise, according to the\\nlicense he had given me, which was well known at our court, and would\\nreturn in a few days, when the ceremony was ended. But he was at last\\nin pain at my long absence; and after consulting with the treasurer and\\nthe rest of that cabal, a person of quality was dispatched with the\\ncopy of the articles against me. This envoy had instructions to\\nrepresent to the monarch of Blefuscu, “the great lenity of his master,\\nwho was content to punish me no farther than with the loss of my eyes;\\nthat I had fled from justice; and if I did not return in two hours, I\\nshould be deprived of my title of _nardac_, and declared a traitor.”\\nThe envoy further added, “that in order to maintain the peace and amity\\nbetween both empires, his master expected that his brother of Blefuscu\\nwould give orders to have me sent back to Lilliput, bound hand and\\nfoot, to be punished as a traitor.”\\n\\nThe emperor of Blefuscu, having taken three days to consult, returned\\nan answer consisting of many civilities and excuses. He said, “that as\\nfor sending me bound, his brother knew it was impossible; that,\\nalthough I had deprived him of his fleet, yet he owed great obligations\\nto me for many good offices I had done him in making the peace. That,\\nhowever, both their majesties would soon be made easy; for I had found\\na prodigious vessel on the shore, able to carry me on the sea, which he\\nhad given orders to fit up, with my own assistance and direction; and\\nhe hoped, in a few weeks, both empires would be freed from so\\ninsupportable an encumbrance.”\\n\\nWith this answer the envoy returned to Lilliput; and the monarch of\\nBlefuscu related to me all that had passed; offering me at the same\\ntime (but under the strictest confidence) his gracious protection, if I\\nwould continue in his service; wherein, although I believed him\\nsincere, yet I resolved never more to put any confidence in princes or\\nministers, where I could possibly avoid it; and therefore, with all due\\nacknowledgments for his favourable intentions, I humbly begged to be\\nexcused. I told him, “that since fortune, whether good or evil, had\\nthrown a vessel in my way, I was resolved to venture myself on the\\nocean, rather than be an occasion of difference between two such mighty\\nmonarchs.” Neither did I find the emperor at all displeased; and I\\ndiscovered, by a certain accident, that he was very glad of my\\nresolution, and so were most of his ministers.\\n\\nThese considerations moved me to hasten my departure somewhat sooner\\nthan I intended; to which the court, impatient to have me gone, very\\nreadily contributed. Five hundred workmen were employed to make two\\nsails to my boat, according to my directions, by quilting thirteen\\nfolds of their strongest linen together. I was at the pains of making\\nropes and cables, by twisting ten, twenty, or thirty of the thickest\\nand strongest of theirs. A great stone that I happened to find, after a\\nlong search, by the sea-shore, served me for an anchor. I had the\\ntallow of three hundred cows, for greasing my boat, and other uses. I\\nwas at incredible pains in cutting down some of the largest\\ntimber-trees, for oars and masts, wherein I was, however, much assisted\\nby his majesty’s ship-carpenters, who helped me in smoothing them,\\nafter I had done the rough work.\\n\\nIn about a month, when all was prepared, I sent to receive his\\nmajesty’s commands, and to take my leave. The emperor and royal family\\ncame out of the palace; I lay down on my face to kiss his hand, which\\nhe very graciously gave me: so did the empress and young princes of the\\nblood. His majesty presented me with fifty purses of two hundred\\n_sprugs_ a-piece, together with his picture at full length, which I put\\nimmediately into one of my gloves, to keep it from being hurt. The\\nceremonies at my departure were too many to trouble the reader with at\\nthis time.\\n\\nI stored the boat with the carcases of a hundred oxen, and three\\nhundred sheep, with bread and drink proportionable, and as much meat\\nready dressed as four hundred cooks could provide. I took with me six\\ncows and two bulls alive, with as many ewes and rams, intending to\\ncarry them into my own country, and propagate the breed. And to feed\\nthem on board, I had a good bundle of hay, and a bag of corn. I would\\ngladly have taken a dozen of the natives, but this was a thing the\\nemperor would by no means permit; and, besides a diligent search into\\nmy pockets, his majesty engaged my honour “not to carry away any of his\\nsubjects, although with their own consent and desire.”\\n\\nHaving thus prepared all things as well as I was able, I set sail on\\nthe twenty-fourth day of September 1701, at six in the morning; and\\nwhen I had gone about four leagues to the northward, the wind being at\\nsouth-east, at six in the evening I descried a small island, about half\\na league to the north-west. I advanced forward, and cast anchor on the\\nlee-side of the island, which seemed to be uninhabited. I then took\\nsome refreshment, and went to my rest. I slept well, and as I\\nconjectured at least six hours, for I found the day broke in two hours\\nafter I awaked. It was a clear night. I ate my breakfast before the sun\\nwas up; and heaving anchor, the wind being favourable, I steered the\\nsame course that I had done the day before, wherein I was directed by\\nmy pocket compass. My intention was to reach, if possible, one of those\\nislands which I had reason to believe lay to the north-east of Van\\nDiemen’s Land. I discovered nothing all that day; but upon the next,\\nabout three in the afternoon, when I had by my computation made\\ntwenty-four leagues from Blefuscu, I descried a sail steering to the\\nsouth-east; my course was due east. I hailed her, but could get no\\nanswer; yet I found I gained upon her, for the wind slackened. I made\\nall the sail I could, and in half an hour she spied me, then hung out\\nher ancient, and discharged a gun. It is not easy to express the joy I\\nwas in, upon the unexpected hope of once more seeing my beloved\\ncountry, and the dear pledges I left in it. The ship slackened her\\nsails, and I came up with her between five and six in the evening,\\nSeptember 26th; but my heart leaped within me to see her English\\ncolours. I put my cows and sheep into my coat-pockets, and got on board\\nwith all my little cargo of provisions. The vessel was an English\\nmerchantman, returning from Japan by the North and South seas; the\\ncaptain, Mr. John Biddel, of Deptford, a very civil man, and an\\nexcellent sailor.\\n\\nWe were now in the latitude of 30 degrees south; there were about fifty\\nmen in the ship; and here I met an old comrade of mine, one Peter\\nWilliams, who gave me a good character to the captain. This gentleman\\ntreated me with kindness, and desired I would let him know what place I\\ncame from last, and whither I was bound; which I did in a few words,\\nbut he thought I was raving, and that the dangers I underwent had\\ndisturbed my head; whereupon I took my black cattle and sheep out of my\\npocket, which, after great astonishment, clearly convinced him of my\\nveracity. I then showed him the gold given me by the emperor of\\nBlefuscu, together with his majesty’s picture at full length, and some\\nother rarities of that country. I gave him two purses of two hundreds\\n_sprugs_ each, and promised, when we arrived in England, to make him a\\npresent of a cow and a sheep big with young.\\n\\nI shall not trouble the reader with a particular account of this\\nvoyage, which was very prosperous for the most part. We arrived in the\\nDowns on the 13th of April, 1702. I had only one misfortune, that the\\nrats on board carried away one of my sheep; I found her bones in a\\nhole, picked clean from the flesh. The rest of my cattle I got safe\\nashore, and set them a-grazing in a bowling-green at Greenwich, where\\nthe fineness of the grass made them feed very heartily, though I had\\nalways feared the contrary: neither could I possibly have preserved\\nthem in so long a voyage, if the captain had not allowed me some of his\\nbest biscuit, which, rubbed to powder, and mingled with water, was\\ntheir constant food. The short time I continued in England, I made a\\nconsiderable profit by showing my cattle to many persons of quality and\\nothers: and before I began my second voyage, I sold them for six\\nhundred pounds. Since my last return I find the breed is considerably\\nincreased, especially the sheep, which I hope will prove much to the\\nadvantage of the woollen manufacture, by the fineness of the fleeces.\\n\\nI stayed but two months with my wife and family, for my insatiable\\ndesire of seeing foreign countries, would suffer me to continue no\\nlonger. I left fifteen hundred pounds with my wife, and fixed her in a\\ngood house at Redriff. My remaining stock I carried with me, part in\\nmoney and part in goods, in hopes to improve my fortunes. My eldest\\nuncle John had left me an estate in land, near Epping, of about thirty\\npounds a year; and I had a long lease of the Black Bull in Fetter Lane,\\nwhich yielded me as much more; so that I was not in any danger of\\nleaving my family upon the parish. My son Johnny, named so after his\\nuncle, was at the grammar school, and a towardly child. My daughter\\nBetty (who is now well married, and has children) was then at her\\nneedlework. I took leave of my wife, and boy and girl, with tears on\\nboth sides, and went on board the Adventure, a merchant ship of three\\nhundred tons, bound for Surat, captain John Nicholas, of Liverpool,\\ncommander. But my account of this voyage must be referred to the Second\\nPart of my Travels.\\n\\n\\nPART II. A VOYAGE TO BROBDINGNAG.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\n\\nA great storm described; the long boat sent to fetch water; the author\\ngoes with it to discover the country. He is left on shore, is seized by\\none of the natives, and carried to a farmer’s house. His reception,\\nwith several accidents that happened there. A description of the\\ninhabitants.\\n\\n\\nHaving been condemned, by nature and fortune, to active and restless\\nlife, in two months after my return, I again left my native country,\\nand took shipping in the Downs, on the 20th day of June, 1702, in the\\nAdventure, Captain John Nicholas, a Cornish man, commander, bound for\\nSurat. We had a very prosperous gale, till we arrived at the Cape of\\nGood Hope, where we landed for fresh water; but discovering a leak, we\\nunshipped our goods and wintered there; for the captain falling sick of\\nan ague, we could not leave the Cape till the end of March. We then set\\nsail, and had a good voyage till we passed the Straits of Madagascar;\\nbut having got northward of that island, and to about five degrees\\nsouth latitude, the winds, which in those seas are observed to blow a\\nconstant equal gale between the north and west, from the beginning of\\nDecember to the beginning of May, on the 19th of April began to blow\\nwith much greater violence, and more westerly than usual, continuing so\\nfor twenty days together: during which time, we were driven a little to\\nthe east of the Molucca Islands, and about three degrees northward of\\nthe line, as our captain found by an observation he took the 2nd of\\nMay, at which time the wind ceased, and it was a perfect calm, whereat\\nI was not a little rejoiced. But he, being a man well experienced in\\nthe navigation of those seas, bid us all prepare against a storm, which\\naccordingly happened the day following: for the southern wind, called\\nthe southern monsoon, began to set in.\\n\\nFinding it was likely to overblow, we took in our sprit-sail, and stood\\nby to hand the fore-sail; but making foul weather, we looked the guns\\nwere all fast, and handed the mizen. The ship lay very broad off, so we\\nthought it better spooning before the sea, than trying or hulling. We\\nreefed the fore-sail and set him, and hauled aft the fore-sheet; the\\nhelm was hard a-weather. The ship wore bravely. We belayed the fore\\ndown-haul; but the sail was split, and we hauled down the yard, and got\\nthe sail into the ship, and unbound all the things clear of it. It was\\na very fierce storm; the sea broke strange and dangerous. We hauled off\\nupon the laniard of the whip-staff, and helped the man at the helm. We\\nwould not get down our topmast, but let all stand, because she scudded\\nbefore the sea very well, and we knew that the top-mast being aloft,\\nthe ship was the wholesomer, and made better way through the sea,\\nseeing we had sea-room. When the storm was over, we set fore-sail and\\nmain-sail, and brought the ship to. Then we set the mizen,\\nmain-top-sail, and the fore-top-sail. Our course was east-north-east,\\nthe wind was at south-west. We got the starboard tacks aboard, we cast\\noff our weather-braces and lifts; we set in the lee-braces, and hauled\\nforward by the weather-bowlings, and hauled them tight, and belayed\\nthem, and hauled over the mizen tack to windward, and kept her full and\\nby as near as she would lie.\\n\\nDuring this storm, which was followed by a strong wind west-south-west,\\nwe were carried, by my computation, about five hundred leagues to the\\neast, so that the oldest sailor on board could not tell in what part of\\nthe world we were. Our provisions held out well, our ship was staunch,\\nand our crew all in good health; but we lay in the utmost distress for\\nwater. We thought it best to hold on the same course, rather than turn\\nmore northerly, which might have brought us to the north-west part of\\nGreat Tartary, and into the Frozen Sea.\\n\\nOn the 16th day of June, 1703, a boy on the top-mast discovered land.\\nOn the 17th, we came in full view of a great island, or continent (for\\nwe knew not whether;) on the south side whereof was a small neck of\\nland jutting out into the sea, and a creek too shallow to hold a ship\\nof above one hundred tons. We cast anchor within a league of this\\ncreek, and our captain sent a dozen of his men well armed in the\\nlong-boat, with vessels for water, if any could be found. I desired his\\nleave to go with them, that I might see the country, and make what\\ndiscoveries I could. When we came to land we saw no river or spring,\\nnor any sign of inhabitants. Our men therefore wandered on the shore to\\nfind out some fresh water near the sea, and I walked alone about a mile\\non the other side, where I observed the country all barren and rocky. I\\nnow began to be weary, and seeing nothing to entertain my curiosity, I\\nreturned gently down towards the creek; and the sea being full in my\\nview, I saw our men already got into the boat, and rowing for life to\\nthe ship. I was going to holla after them, although it had been to\\nlittle purpose, when I observed a huge creature walking after them in\\nthe sea, as fast as he could: he waded not much deeper than his knees,\\nand took prodigious strides: but our men had the start of him half a\\nleague, and, the sea thereabouts being full of sharp-pointed rocks, the\\nmonster was not able to overtake the boat. This I was afterwards told,\\nfor I durst not stay to see the issue of the adventure; but ran as fast\\nas I could the way I first went, and then climbed up a steep hill,\\nwhich gave me some prospect of the country. I found it fully\\ncultivated; but that which first surprised me was the length of the\\ngrass, which, in those grounds that seemed to be kept for hay, was\\nabout twenty feet high.\\n\\nI fell into a high road, for so I took it to be, though it served to\\nthe inhabitants only as a foot-path through a field of barley. Here I\\nwalked on for some time, but could see little on either side, it being\\nnow near harvest, and the corn rising at least forty feet. I was an\\nhour walking to the end of this field, which was fenced in with a hedge\\nof at least one hundred and twenty feet high, and the trees so lofty\\nthat I could make no computation of their altitude. There was a stile\\nto pass from this field into the next. It had four steps, and a stone\\nto cross over when you came to the uppermost. It was impossible for me\\nto climb this stile, because every step was six-feet high, and the\\nupper stone about twenty. I was endeavouring to find some gap in the\\nhedge, when I discovered one of the inhabitants in the next field,\\nadvancing towards the stile, of the same size with him whom I saw in\\nthe sea pursuing our boat. He appeared as tall as an ordinary spire\\nsteeple, and took about ten yards at every stride, as near as I could\\nguess. I was struck with the utmost fear and astonishment, and ran to\\nhide myself in the corn, whence I saw him at the top of the stile\\nlooking back into the next field on the right hand, and heard him call\\nin a voice many degrees louder than a speaking-trumpet: but the noise\\nwas so high in the air, that at first I certainly thought it was\\nthunder. Whereupon seven monsters, like himself, came towards him with\\nreaping-hooks in their hands, each hook about the largeness of six\\nscythes. These people were not so well clad as the first, whose\\nservants or labourers they seemed to be; for, upon some words he spoke,\\nthey went to reap the corn in the field where I lay. I kept from them\\nat as great a distance as I could, but was forced to move with extreme\\ndifficulty, for the stalks of the corn were sometimes not above a foot\\ndistant, so that I could hardly squeeze my body betwixt them. However,\\nI made a shift to go forward, till I came to a part of the field where\\nthe corn had been laid by the rain and wind. Here it was impossible for\\nme to advance a step; for the stalks were so interwoven, that I could\\nnot creep through, and the beards of the fallen ears so strong and\\npointed, that they pierced through my clothes into my flesh. At the\\nsame time I heard the reapers not a hundred yards behind me. Being\\nquite dispirited with toil, and wholly overcome by grief and dispair, I\\nlay down between two ridges, and heartily wished I might there end my\\ndays. I bemoaned my desolate widow and fatherless children. I lamented\\nmy own folly and wilfulness, in attempting a second voyage, against the\\nadvice of all my friends and relations. In this terrible agitation of\\nmind, I could not forbear thinking of Lilliput, whose inhabitants\\nlooked upon me as the greatest prodigy that ever appeared in the world;\\nwhere I was able to draw an imperial fleet in my hand, and perform\\nthose other actions, which will be recorded for ever in the chronicles\\nof that empire, while posterity shall hardly believe them, although\\nattested by millions. I reflected what a mortification it must prove to\\nme, to appear as inconsiderable in this nation, as one single\\nLilliputian would be among us. But this I conceived was to be the least\\nof my misfortunes; for, as human creatures are observed to be more\\nsavage and cruel in proportion to their bulk, what could I expect but\\nto be a morsel in the mouth of the first among these enormous\\nbarbarians that should happen to seize me? Undoubtedly philosophers are\\nin the right, when they tell us that nothing is great or little\\notherwise than by comparison. It might have pleased fortune, to have\\nlet the Lilliputians find some nation, where the people were as\\ndiminutive with respect to them, as they were to me. And who knows but\\nthat even this prodigious race of mortals might be equally overmatched\\nin some distant part of the world, whereof we have yet no discovery.\\n\\nScared and confounded as I was, I could not forbear going on with these\\nreflections, when one of the reapers, approaching within ten yards of\\nthe ridge where I lay, made me apprehend that with the next step I\\nshould be squashed to death under his foot, or cut in two with his\\nreaping-hook. And therefore, when he was again about to move, I\\nscreamed as loud as fear could make me: whereupon the huge creature\\ntrod short, and, looking round about under him for some time, at last\\nespied me as I lay on the ground. He considered awhile, with the\\ncaution of one who endeavours to lay hold on a small dangerous animal\\nin such a manner that it shall not be able either to scratch or bite\\nhim, as I myself have sometimes done with a weasel in England. At\\nlength he ventured to take me behind, by the middle, between his\\nfore-finger and thumb, and brought me within three yards of his eyes,\\nthat he might behold my shape more perfectly. I guessed his meaning,\\nand my good fortune gave me so much presence of mind, that I resolved\\nnot to struggle in the least as he held me in the air above sixty feet\\nfrom the ground, although he grievously pinched my sides, for fear I\\nshould slip through his fingers. All I ventured was to raise my eyes\\ntowards the sun, and place my hands together in a supplicating posture,\\nand to speak some words in a humble melancholy tone, suitable to the\\ncondition I then was in: for I apprehended every moment that he would\\ndash me against the ground, as we usually do any little hateful animal,\\nwhich we have a mind to destroy. But my good star would have it, that\\nhe appeared pleased with my voice and gestures, and began to look upon\\nme as a curiosity, much wondering to hear me pronounce articulate\\nwords, although he could not understand them. In the mean time I was\\nnot able to forbear groaning and shedding tears, and turning my head\\ntowards my sides; letting him know, as well as I could, how cruelly I\\nwas hurt by the pressure of his thumb and finger. He seemed to\\napprehend my meaning; for, lifting up the lappet of his coat, he put me\\ngently into it, and immediately ran along with me to his master, who\\nwas a substantial farmer, and the same person I had first seen in the\\nfield.\\n\\nThe farmer having (as I suppose by their talk) received such an account\\nof me as his servant could give him, took a piece of a small straw,\\nabout the size of a walking-staff, and therewith lifted up the lappets\\nof my coat; which it seems he thought to be some kind of covering that\\nnature had given me. He blew my hairs aside to take a better view of my\\nface. He called his hinds about him, and asked them, as I afterwards\\nlearned, whether they had ever seen in the fields any little creature\\nthat resembled me. He then placed me softly on the ground upon all\\nfours, but I got immediately up, and walked slowly backward and\\nforward, to let those people see I had no intent to run away. They all\\nsat down in a circle about me, the better to observe my motions. I\\npulled off my hat, and made a low bow towards the farmer. I fell on my\\nknees, and lifted up my hands and eyes, and spoke several words as loud\\nas I could: I took a purse of gold out of my pocket, and humbly\\npresented it to him. He received it on the palm of his hand, then\\napplied it close to his eye to see what it was, and afterwards turned\\nit several times with the point of a pin (which he took out of his\\nsleeve,) but could make nothing of it. Whereupon I made a sign that he\\nshould place his hand on the ground. I then took the purse, and,\\nopening it, poured all the gold into his palm. There were six Spanish\\npieces of four pistoles each, beside twenty or thirty smaller coins. I\\nsaw him wet the tip of his little finger upon his tongue, and take up\\none of my largest pieces, and then another; but he seemed to be wholly\\nignorant what they were. He made me a sign to put them again into my\\npurse, and the purse again into my pocket, which, after offering it to\\nhim several times, I thought it best to do.\\n\\nThe farmer, by this time, was convinced I must be a rational creature.\\nHe spoke often to me; but the sound of his voice pierced my ears like\\nthat of a water-mill, yet his words were articulate enough. I answered\\nas loud as I could in several languages, and he often laid his ear\\nwithin two yards of me: but all in vain, for we were wholly\\nunintelligible to each other. He then sent his servants to their work,\\nand taking his handkerchief out of his pocket, he doubled and spread it\\non his left hand, which he placed flat on the ground with the palm\\nupward, making me a sign to step into it, as I could easily do, for it\\nwas not above a foot in thickness. I thought it my part to obey, and,\\nfor fear of falling, laid myself at full length upon the handkerchief,\\nwith the remainder of which he lapped me up to the head for further\\nsecurity, and in this manner carried me home to his house. There he\\ncalled his wife, and showed me to her; but she screamed and ran back,\\nas women in England do at the sight of a toad or a spider. However,\\nwhen she had a while seen my behaviour, and how well I observed the\\nsigns her husband made, she was soon reconciled, and by degrees grew\\nextremely tender of me.\\n\\nIt was about twelve at noon, and a servant brought in dinner. It was\\nonly one substantial dish of meat (fit for the plain condition of a\\nhusbandman,) in a dish of about four-and-twenty feet diameter. The\\ncompany were, the farmer and his wife, three children, and an old\\ngrandmother. When they were sat down, the farmer placed me at some\\ndistance from him on the table, which was thirty feet high from the\\nfloor. I was in a terrible fright, and kept as far as I could from the\\nedge, for fear of falling. The wife minced a bit of meat, then crumbled\\nsome bread on a trencher, and placed it before me. I made her a low\\nbow, took out my knife and fork, and fell to eat, which gave them\\nexceeding delight. The mistress sent her maid for a small dram cup,\\nwhich held about two gallons, and filled it with drink; I took up the\\nvessel with much difficulty in both hands, and in a most respectful\\nmanner drank to her ladyship’s health, expressing the words as loud as\\nI could in English, which made the company laugh so heartily, that I\\nwas almost deafened with the noise. This liquor tasted like a small\\ncider, and was not unpleasant. Then the master made me a sign to come\\nto his trencher side; but as I walked on the table, being in great\\nsurprise all the time, as the indulgent reader will easily conceive and\\nexcuse, I happened to stumble against a crust, and fell flat on my\\nface, but received no hurt. I got up immediately, and observing the\\ngood people to be in much concern, I took my hat (which I held under my\\narm out of good manners,) and waving it over my head, made three\\nhuzzas, to show I had got no mischief by my fall. But advancing forward\\ntowards my master (as I shall henceforth call him,) his youngest son,\\nwho sat next to him, an arch boy of about ten years old, took me up by\\nthe legs, and held me so high in the air, that I trembled every limb:\\nbut his father snatched me from him, and at the same time gave him such\\na box on the left ear, as would have felled an European troop of horse\\nto the earth, ordering him to be taken from the table. But being afraid\\nthe boy might owe me a spite, and well remembering how mischievous all\\nchildren among us naturally are to sparrows, rabbits, young kittens,\\nand puppy dogs, I fell on my knees, and pointing to the boy, made my\\nmaster to understand, as well as I could, that I desired his son might\\nbe pardoned. The father complied, and the lad took his seat again,\\nwhereupon I went to him, and kissed his hand, which my master took, and\\nmade him stroke me gently with it.\\n\\nIn the midst of dinner, my mistress’s favourite cat leaped into her\\nlap. I heard a noise behind me like that of a dozen stocking-weavers at\\nwork; and turning my head, I found it proceeded from the purring of\\nthat animal, who seemed to be three times larger than an ox, as I\\ncomputed by the view of her head, and one of her paws, while her\\nmistress was feeding and stroking her. The fierceness of this\\ncreature’s countenance altogether discomposed me; though I stood at the\\nfarther end of the table, above fifty feet off; and although my\\nmistress held her fast, for fear she might give a spring, and seize me\\nin her talons. But it happened there was no danger, for the cat took\\nnot the least notice of me when my master placed me within three yards\\nof her. And as I have been always told, and found true by experience in\\nmy travels, that flying or discovering fear before a fierce animal, is\\na certain way to make it pursue or attack you, so I resolved, in this\\ndangerous juncture, to show no manner of concern. I walked with\\nintrepidity five or six times before the very head of the cat, and came\\nwithin half a yard of her; whereupon she drew herself back, as if she\\nwere more afraid of me: I had less apprehension concerning the dogs,\\nwhereof three or four came into the room, as it is usual in farmers’\\nhouses; one of which was a mastiff, equal in bulk to four elephants,\\nand another a greyhound, somewhat taller than the mastiff, but not so\\nlarge.\\n\\nWhen dinner was almost done, the nurse came in with a child of a year\\nold in her arms, who immediately spied me, and began a squall that you\\nmight have heard from London Bridge to Chelsea, after the usual oratory\\nof infants, to get me for a plaything. The mother, out of pure\\nindulgence, took me up, and put me towards the child, who presently\\nseized me by the middle, and got my head into his mouth, where I roared\\nso loud that the urchin was frighted, and let me drop, and I should\\ninfallibly have broke my neck, if the mother had not held her apron\\nunder me. The nurse, to quiet her babe, made use of a rattle which was\\na kind of hollow vessel filled with great stones, and fastened by a\\ncable to the child’s waist: but all in vain; so that she was forced to\\napply the last remedy by giving it suck. I must confess no object ever\\ndisgusted me so much as the sight of her monstrous breast, which I\\ncannot tell what to compare with, so as to give the curious reader an\\nidea of its bulk, shape, and colour. It stood prominent six feet, and\\ncould not be less than sixteen in circumference. The nipple was about\\nhalf the bigness of my head, and the hue both of that and the dug, so\\nvaried with spots, pimples, and freckles, that nothing could appear\\nmore nauseous: for I had a near sight of her, she sitting down, the\\nmore conveniently to give suck, and I standing on the table. This made\\nme reflect upon the fair skins of our English ladies, who appear so\\nbeautiful to us, only because they are of our own size, and their\\ndefects not to be seen but through a magnifying glass; where we find by\\nexperiment that the smoothest and whitest skins look rough, and coarse,\\nand ill-coloured.\\n\\nI remember when I was at Lilliput, the complexion of those diminutive\\npeople appeared to me the fairest in the world; and talking upon this\\nsubject with a person of learning there, who was an intimate friend of\\nmine, he said that my face appeared much fairer and smoother when he\\nlooked on me from the ground, than it did upon a nearer view, when I\\ntook him up in my hand, and brought him close, which he confessed was\\nat first a very shocking sight. He said, “he could discover great holes\\nin my skin; that the stumps of my beard were ten times stronger than\\nthe bristles of a boar, and my complexion made up of several colours\\naltogether disagreeable:” although I must beg leave to say for myself,\\nthat I am as fair as most of my sex and country, and very little\\nsunburnt by all my travels. On the other side, discoursing of the\\nladies in that emperor’s court, he used to tell me, “one had freckles;\\nanother too wide a mouth; a third too large a nose;” nothing of which I\\nwas able to distinguish. I confess this reflection was obvious enough;\\nwhich, however, I could not forbear, lest the reader might think those\\nvast creatures were actually deformed: for I must do them the justice\\nto say, they are a comely race of people, and particularly the features\\nof my master’s countenance, although he was but a farmer, when I beheld\\nhim from the height of sixty feet, appeared very well proportioned.\\n\\nWhen dinner was done, my master went out to his labourers, and, as I\\ncould discover by his voice and gesture, gave his wife strict charge to\\ntake care of me. I was very much tired, and disposed to sleep, which my\\nmistress perceiving, she put me on her own bed, and covered me with a\\nclean white handkerchief, but larger and coarser than the mainsail of a\\nman of war.\\n\\nI slept about two hours, and dreamt I was at home with my wife and\\nchildren, which aggravated my sorrows when I awaked, and found myself\\nalone in a vast room, between two and three hundred feet wide, and\\nabove two hundred high, lying in a bed twenty yards wide. My mistress\\nwas gone about her household affairs, and had locked me in. The bed was\\neight yards from the floor. Some natural necessities required me to get\\ndown; I durst not presume to call; and if I had, it would have been in\\nvain, with such a voice as mine, at so great a distance from the room\\nwhere I lay to the kitchen where the family kept. While I was under\\nthese circumstances, two rats crept up the curtains, and ran smelling\\nbackwards and forwards on the bed. One of them came up almost to my\\nface, whereupon I rose in a fright, and drew out my hanger to defend\\nmyself. These horrible animals had the boldness to attack me on both\\nsides, and one of them held his forefeet at my collar; but I had the\\ngood fortune to rip up his belly before he could do me any mischief. He\\nfell down at my feet; and the other, seeing the fate of his comrade,\\nmade his escape, but not without one good wound on the back, which I\\ngave him as he fled, and made the blood run trickling from him. After\\nthis exploit, I walked gently to and fro on the bed, to recover my\\nbreath and loss of spirits. These creatures were of the size of a large\\nmastiff, but infinitely more nimble and fierce; so that if I had taken\\noff my belt before I went to sleep, I must have infallibly been torn to\\npieces and devoured. I measured the tail of the dead rat, and found it\\nto be two yards long, wanting an inch; but it went against my stomach\\nto drag the carcass off the bed, where it lay still bleeding; I\\nobserved it had yet some life, but with a strong slash across the neck,\\nI thoroughly despatched it.\\n\\nSoon after my mistress came into the room, who seeing me all bloody,\\nran and took me up in her hand. I pointed to the dead rat, smiling, and\\nmaking other signs to show I was not hurt; whereat she was extremely\\nrejoiced, calling the maid to take up the dead rat with a pair of\\ntongs, and throw it out of the window. Then she set me on a table,\\nwhere I showed her my hanger all bloody, and wiping it on the lappet of\\nmy coat, returned it to the scabbard. I was pressed to do more than one\\nthing which another could not do for me, and therefore endeavoured to\\nmake my mistress understand, that I desired to be set down on the\\nfloor; which after she had done, my bashfulness would not suffer me to\\nexpress myself farther, than by pointing to the door, and bowing\\nseveral times. The good woman, with much difficulty, at last perceived\\nwhat I would be at, and taking me up again in her hand, walked into the\\ngarden, where she set me down. I went on one side about two hundred\\nyards, and beckoning to her not to look or to follow me, I hid myself\\nbetween two leaves of sorrel, and there discharged the necessities of\\nnature.\\n\\nI hope the gentle reader will excuse me for dwelling on these and the\\nlike particulars, which, however insignificant they may appear to\\ngroveling vulgar minds, yet will certainly help a philosopher to\\nenlarge his thoughts and imagination, and apply them to the benefit of\\npublic as well as private life, which was my sole design in presenting\\nthis and other accounts of my travels to the world; wherein I have been\\nchiefly studious of truth, without affecting any ornaments of learning\\nor of style. But the whole scene of this voyage made so strong an\\nimpression on my mind, and is so deeply fixed in my memory, that, in\\ncommitting it to paper I did not omit one material circumstance:\\nhowever, upon a strict review, I blotted out several passages of less\\nmoment which were in my first copy, for fear of being censured as\\ntedious and trifling, whereof travellers are often, perhaps not without\\njustice, accused.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\nA description of the farmer’s daughter. The author carried to a\\nmarket-town, and then to the metropolis. The particulars of his\\njourney.\\n\\n\\nMy mistress had a daughter of nine years old, a child of towardly parts\\nfor her age, very dexterous at her needle, and skilful in dressing her\\nbaby. Her mother and she contrived to fit up the baby’s cradle for me\\nagainst night: the cradle was put into a small drawer of a cabinet, and\\nthe drawer placed upon a hanging shelf for fear of the rats. This was\\nmy bed all the time I staid with those people, though made more\\nconvenient by degrees, as I began to learn their language and make my\\nwants known. This young girl was so handy, that after I had once or\\ntwice pulled off my clothes before her, she was able to dress and\\nundress me, though I never gave her that trouble when she would let me\\ndo either myself. She made me seven shirts, and some other linen, of as\\nfine cloth as could be got, which indeed was coarser than sackcloth;\\nand these she constantly washed for me with her own hands. She was\\nlikewise my school-mistress, to teach me the language: when I pointed\\nto any thing, she told me the name of it in her own tongue, so that in\\na few days I was able to call for whatever I had a mind to. She was\\nvery good-natured, and not above forty feet high, being little for her\\nage. She gave me the name of _Grildrig_, which the family took up, and\\nafterwards the whole kingdom. The word imports what the Latins call\\n_nanunculus_, the Italians _homunceletino_, and the English _mannikin_.\\nTo her I chiefly owe my preservation in that country: we never parted\\nwhile I was there; I called her my _Glumdalclitch_, or little nurse;\\nand should be guilty of great ingratitude, if I omitted this honourable\\nmention of her care and affection towards me, which I heartily wish it\\nlay in my power to requite as she deserves, instead of being the\\ninnocent, but unhappy instrument of her disgrace, as I have too much\\nreason to fear.\\n\\nIt now began to be known and talked of in the neighbourhood, that my\\nmaster had found a strange animal in the field, about the bigness of a\\n_splacnuck_, but exactly shaped in every part like a human creature;\\nwhich it likewise imitated in all its actions; seemed to speak in a\\nlittle language of its own, had already learned several words of\\ntheirs, went erect upon two legs, was tame and gentle, would come when\\nit was called, do whatever it was bid, had the finest limbs in the\\nworld, and a complexion fairer than a nobleman’s daughter of three\\nyears old. Another farmer, who lived hard by, and was a particular\\nfriend of my master, came on a visit on purpose to inquire into the\\ntruth of this story. I was immediately produced, and placed upon a\\ntable, where I walked as I was commanded, drew my hanger, put it up\\nagain, made my reverence to my master’s guest, asked him in his own\\nlanguage how he did, and told him _he was welcome_, just as my little\\nnurse had instructed me. This man, who was old and dim-sighted, put on\\nhis spectacles to behold me better; at which I could not forbear\\nlaughing very heartily, for his eyes appeared like the full moon\\nshining into a chamber at two windows. Our people, who discovered the\\ncause of my mirth, bore me company in laughing, at which the old fellow\\nwas fool enough to be angry and out of countenance. He had the\\ncharacter of a great miser; and, to my misfortune, he well deserved it,\\nby the cursed advice he gave my master, to show me as a sight upon a\\nmarket-day in the next town, which was half an hour’s riding, about\\ntwo-and-twenty miles from our house. I guessed there was some mischief\\nwhen I observed my master and his friend whispering together, sometimes\\npointing at me; and my fears made me fancy that I overheard and\\nunderstood some of their words. But the next morning Glumdalclitch, my\\nlittle nurse, told me the whole matter, which she had cunningly picked\\nout from her mother. The poor girl laid me on her bosom, and fell a\\nweeping with shame and grief. She apprehended some mischief would\\nhappen to me from rude vulgar folks, who might squeeze me to death, or\\nbreak one of my limbs by taking me in their hands. She had also\\nobserved how modest I was in my nature, how nicely I regarded my\\nhonour, and what an indignity I should conceive it, to be exposed for\\nmoney as a public spectacle, to the meanest of the people. She said,\\nher papa and mamma had promised that Grildrig should be hers; but now\\nshe found they meant to serve her as they did last year, when they\\npretended to give her a lamb, and yet, as soon as it was fat, sold it\\nto a butcher. For my own part, I may truly affirm, that I was less\\nconcerned than my nurse. I had a strong hope, which never left me, that\\nI should one day recover my liberty: and as to the ignominy of being\\ncarried about for a monster, I considered myself to be a perfect\\nstranger in the country, and that such a misfortune could never be\\ncharged upon me as a reproach, if ever I should return to England,\\nsince the king of Great Britain himself, in my condition, must have\\nundergone the same distress.\\n\\nMy master, pursuant to the advice of his friend, carried me in a box\\nthe next market-day to the neighbouring town, and took along with him\\nhis little daughter, my nurse, upon a pillion behind him. The box was\\nclose on every side, with a little door for me to go in and out, and a\\nfew gimlet holes to let in air. The girl had been so careful as to put\\nthe quilt of her baby’s bed into it, for me to lie down on. However, I\\nwas terribly shaken and discomposed in this journey, though it was but\\nof half an hour: for the horse went about forty feet at every step and\\ntrotted so high, that the agitation was equal to the rising and falling\\nof a ship in a great storm, but much more frequent. Our journey was\\nsomewhat farther than from London to St. Alban’s. My master alighted at\\nan inn which he used to frequent; and after consulting a while with the\\ninn-keeper, and making some necessary preparations, he hired the\\n_grultrud_, or crier, to give notice through the town of a strange\\ncreature to be seen at the sign of the Green Eagle, not so big as a\\n_splacnuck_ (an animal in that country very finely shaped, about six\\nfeet long,) and in every part of the body resembling a human creature,\\ncould speak several words, and perform a hundred diverting tricks.\\n\\nI was placed upon a table in the largest room of the inn, which might\\nbe near three hundred feet square. My little nurse stood on a low stool\\nclose to the table, to take care of me, and direct what I should do. My\\nmaster, to avoid a crowd, would suffer only thirty people at a time to\\nsee me. I walked about on the table as the girl commanded; she asked me\\nquestions, as far as she knew my understanding of the language reached,\\nand I answered them as loud as I could. I turned about several times to\\nthe company, paid my humble respects, said _they were welcome_, and\\nused some other speeches I had been taught. I took up a thimble filled\\nwith liquor, which Glumdalclitch had given me for a cup, and drank\\ntheir health, I drew out my hanger, and flourished with it after the\\nmanner of fencers in England. My nurse gave me a part of a straw, which\\nI exercised as a pike, having learnt the art in my youth. I was that\\nday shown to twelve sets of company, and as often forced to act over\\nagain the same fopperies, till I was half dead with weariness and\\nvexation; for those who had seen me made such wonderful reports, that\\nthe people were ready to break down the doors to come in. My master,\\nfor his own interest, would not suffer any one to touch me except my\\nnurse; and to prevent danger, benches were set round the table at such\\na distance as to put me out of every body’s reach. However, an unlucky\\nschool-boy aimed a hazel nut directly at my head, which very narrowly\\nmissed me; otherwise it came with so much violence, that it would have\\ninfallibly knocked out my brains, for it was almost as large as a small\\npumpkin, but I had the satisfaction to see the young rogue well beaten,\\nand turned out of the room.\\n\\nMy master gave public notice that he would show me again the next\\nmarket-day; and in the meantime he prepared a convenient vehicle for\\nme, which he had reason enough to do; for I was so tired with my first\\njourney, and with entertaining company for eight hours together, that I\\ncould hardly stand upon my legs, or speak a word. It was at least three\\ndays before I recovered my strength; and that I might have no rest at\\nhome, all the neighbouring gentlemen from a hundred miles round,\\nhearing of my fame, came to see me at my master’s own house. There\\ncould not be fewer than thirty persons with their wives and children\\n(for the country is very populous;) and my master demanded the rate of\\na full room whenever he showed me at home, although it were only to a\\nsingle family; so that for some time I had but little ease every day of\\nthe week (except Wednesday, which is their Sabbath,) although I were\\nnot carried to the town.\\n\\nMy master, finding how profitable I was likely to be, resolved to carry\\nme to the most considerable cities of the kingdom. Having therefore\\nprovided himself with all things necessary for a long journey, and\\nsettled his affairs at home, he took leave of his wife, and upon the\\n17th of August, 1703, about two months after my arrival, we set out for\\nthe metropolis, situated near the middle of that empire, and about\\nthree thousand miles distance from our house. My master made his\\ndaughter Glumdalclitch ride behind him. She carried me on her lap, in a\\nbox tied about her waist. The girl had lined it on all sides with the\\nsoftest cloth she could get, well quilted underneath, furnished it with\\nher baby’s bed, provided me with linen and other necessaries, and made\\neverything as convenient as she could. We had no other company but a\\nboy of the house, who rode after us with the luggage.\\n\\nMy master’s design was to show me in all the towns by the way, and to\\nstep out of the road for fifty or a hundred miles, to any village, or\\nperson of quality’s house, where he might expect custom. We made easy\\njourneys, of not above seven or eight score miles a day; for\\nGlumdalclitch, on purpose to spare me, complained she was tired with\\nthe trotting of the horse. She often took me out of my box, at my own\\ndesire, to give me air, and show me the country, but always held me\\nfast by a leading-string. We passed over five or six rivers, many\\ndegrees broader and deeper than the Nile or the Ganges: and there was\\nhardly a rivulet so small as the Thames at London Bridge. We were ten\\nweeks in our journey, and I was shown in eighteen large towns, besides\\nmany villages, and private families.\\n\\nOn the 26th day of October we arrived at the metropolis, called in\\ntheir language _Lorbrulgrud_, or Pride of the Universe. My master took\\na lodging in the principal street of the city, not far from the royal\\npalace, and put out bills in the usual form, containing an exact\\ndescription of my person and parts. He hired a large room between three\\nand four hundred feet wide. He provided a table sixty feet in diameter,\\nupon which I was to act my part, and pallisadoed it round three feet\\nfrom the edge, and as many high, to prevent my falling over. I was\\nshown ten times a day, to the wonder and satisfaction of all people. I\\ncould now speak the language tolerably well, and perfectly understood\\nevery word, that was spoken to me. Besides, I had learnt their\\nalphabet, and could make a shift to explain a sentence here and there;\\nfor Glumdalclitch had been my instructor while we were at home, and at\\nleisure hours during our journey. She carried a little book in her\\npocket, not much larger than a Sanson’s Atlas; it was a common treatise\\nfor the use of young girls, giving a short account of their religion:\\nout of this she taught me my letters, and interpreted the words.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\nThe author sent for to court. The queen buys him of his master the\\nfarmer, and presents him to the king. He disputes with his majesty’s\\ngreat scholars. An apartment at court provided for the author. He is in\\nhigh favour with the queen. He stands up for the honour of his own\\ncountry. His quarrels with the queen’s dwarf.\\n\\n\\nThe frequent labours I underwent every day, made, in a few weeks, a\\nvery considerable change in my health: the more my master got by me,\\nthe more insatiable he grew. I had quite lost my stomach, and was\\nalmost reduced to a skeleton. The farmer observed it, and concluding I\\nmust soon die, resolved to make as good a hand of me as he could. While\\nhe was thus reasoning and resolving with himself, a _sardral_, or\\ngentleman-usher, came from court, commanding my master to carry me\\nimmediately thither for the diversion of the queen and her ladies. Some\\nof the latter had already been to see me, and reported strange things\\nof my beauty, behaviour, and good sense. Her majesty, and those who\\nattended her, were beyond measure delighted with my demeanour. I fell\\non my knees, and begged the honour of kissing her imperial foot; but\\nthis gracious princess held out her little finger towards me, after I\\nwas set on the table, which I embraced in both my arms, and put the tip\\nof it with the utmost respect to my lip. She made me some general\\nquestions about my country and my travels, which I answered as\\ndistinctly, and in as few words as I could. She asked, “whether I could\\nbe content to live at court?” I bowed down to the board of the table,\\nand humbly answered “that I was my master’s slave: but, if I were at my\\nown disposal, I should be proud to devote my life to her majesty’s\\nservice.” She then asked my master, “whether he was willing to sell me\\nat a good price?” He, who apprehended I could not live a month, was\\nready enough to part with me, and demanded a thousand pieces of gold,\\nwhich were ordered him on the spot, each piece being about the bigness\\nof eight hundred moidores; but allowing for the proportion of all\\nthings between that country and Europe, and the high price of gold\\namong them, was hardly so great a sum as a thousand guineas would be in\\nEngland. I then said to the queen, “since I was now her majesty’s most\\nhumble creature and vassal, I must beg the favour, that Glumdalclitch,\\nwho had always tended me with so much care and kindness, and understood\\nto do it so well, might be admitted into her service, and continue to\\nbe my nurse and instructor.”\\n\\nHer majesty agreed to my petition, and easily got the farmer’s consent,\\nwho was glad enough to have his daughter preferred at court, and the\\npoor girl herself was not able to hide her joy. My late master\\nwithdrew, bidding me farewell, and saying he had left me in a good\\nservice; to which I replied not a word, only making him a slight bow.\\n\\nThe queen observed my coldness; and, when the farmer was gone out of\\nthe apartment, asked me the reason. I made bold to tell her majesty,\\n“that I owed no other obligation to my late master, than his not\\ndashing out the brains of a poor harmless creature, found by chance in\\nhis fields: which obligation was amply recompensed, by the gain he had\\nmade in showing me through half the kingdom, and the price he had now\\nsold me for. That the life I had since led was laborious enough to kill\\nan animal of ten times my strength. That my health was much impaired,\\nby the continual drudgery of entertaining the rabble every hour of the\\nday; and that, if my master had not thought my life in danger, her\\nmajesty would not have got so cheap a bargain. But as I was out of all\\nfear of being ill-treated under the protection of so great and good an\\nempress, the ornament of nature, the darling of the world, the delight\\nof her subjects, the phœnix of the creation, so I hoped my late\\nmaster’s apprehensions would appear to be groundless; for I already\\nfound my spirits revive, by the influence of her most august presence.”\\n\\nThis was the sum of my speech, delivered with great improprieties and\\nhesitation. The latter part was altogether framed in the style peculiar\\nto that people, whereof I learned some phrases from Glumdalclitch,\\nwhile she was carrying me to court.\\n\\nThe queen, giving great allowance for my defectiveness in speaking,\\nwas, however, surprised at so much wit and good sense in so diminutive\\nan animal. She took me in her own hand, and carried me to the king, who\\nwas then retired to his cabinet. His majesty, a prince of much gravity\\nand austere countenance, not well observing my shape at first view,\\nasked the queen after a cold manner “how long it was since she grew\\nfond of a _splacnuck_?” for such it seems he took me to be, as I lay\\nupon my breast in her majesty’s right hand. But this princess, who has\\nan infinite deal of wit and humour, set me gently on my feet upon the\\nscrutoire, and commanded me to give his majesty an account of myself,\\nwhich I did in a very few words: and Glumdalclitch who attended at the\\ncabinet door, and could not endure I should be out of her sight, being\\nadmitted, confirmed all that had passed from my arrival at her father’s\\nhouse.\\n\\nThe king, although he be as learned a person as any in his dominions,\\nhad been educated in the study of philosophy, and particularly\\nmathematics; yet when he observed my shape exactly, and saw me walk\\nerect, before I began to speak, conceived I might be a piece of\\nclock-work (which is in that country arrived to a very great\\nperfection) contrived by some ingenious artist. But when he heard my\\nvoice, and found what I delivered to be regular and rational, he could\\nnot conceal his astonishment. He was by no means satisfied with the\\nrelation I gave him of the manner I came into his kingdom, but thought\\nit a story concerted between Glumdalclitch and her father, who had\\ntaught me a set of words to make me sell at a better price. Upon this\\nimagination, he put several other questions to me, and still received\\nrational answers: no otherwise defective than by a foreign accent, and\\nan imperfect knowledge in the language, with some rustic phrases which\\nI had learned at the farmer’s house, and did not suit the polite style\\nof a court.\\n\\nHis majesty sent for three great scholars, who were then in their\\nweekly waiting, according to the custom in that country. These\\ngentlemen, after they had a while examined my shape with much nicety,\\nwere of different opinions concerning me. They all agreed that I could\\nnot be produced according to the regular laws of nature, because I was\\nnot framed with a capacity of preserving my life, either by swiftness,\\nor climbing of trees, or digging holes in the earth. They observed by\\nmy teeth, which they viewed with great exactness, that I was a\\ncarnivorous animal; yet most quadrupeds being an overmatch for me, and\\nfield mice, with some others, too nimble, they could not imagine how I\\nshould be able to support myself, unless I fed upon snails and other\\ninsects, which they offered, by many learned arguments, to evince that\\nI could not possibly do. One of these virtuosi seemed to think that I\\nmight be an embryo, or abortive birth. But this opinion was rejected by\\nthe other two, who observed my limbs to be perfect and finished; and\\nthat I had lived several years, as it was manifest from my beard, the\\nstumps whereof they plainly discovered through a magnifying glass. They\\nwould not allow me to be a dwarf, because my littleness was beyond all\\ndegrees of comparison; for the queen’s favourite dwarf, the smallest\\never known in that kingdom, was near thirty feet high. After much\\ndebate, they concluded unanimously, that I was only _relplum scalcath_,\\nwhich is interpreted literally _lusus naturæ_; a determination exactly\\nagreeable to the modern philosophy of Europe, whose professors,\\ndisdaining the old evasion of occult causes, whereby the followers of\\nAristotle endeavoured in vain to disguise their ignorance, have\\ninvented this wonderful solution of all difficulties, to the\\nunspeakable advancement of human knowledge.\\n\\nAfter this decisive conclusion, I entreated to be heard a word or two.\\nI applied myself to the king, and assured his majesty, “that I came\\nfrom a country which abounded with several millions of both sexes, and\\nof my own stature; where the animals, trees, and houses, were all in\\nproportion, and where, by consequence, I might be as able to defend\\nmyself, and to find sustenance, as any of his majesty’s subjects could\\ndo here; which I took for a full answer to those gentlemen’s\\narguments.” To this they only replied with a smile of contempt, saying,\\n“that the farmer had instructed me very well in my lesson.” The king,\\nwho had a much better understanding, dismissing his learned men, sent\\nfor the farmer, who by good fortune was not yet gone out of town.\\nHaving therefore first examined him privately, and then confronted him\\nwith me and the young girl, his majesty began to think that what we\\ntold him might possibly be true. He desired the queen to order that a\\nparticular care should be taken of me; and was of opinion that\\nGlumdalclitch should still continue in her office of tending me,\\nbecause he observed we had a great affection for each other. A\\nconvenient apartment was provided for her at court: she had a sort of\\ngoverness appointed to take care of her education, a maid to dress her,\\nand two other servants for menial offices; but the care of me was\\nwholly appropriated to herself. The queen commanded her own\\ncabinet-maker to contrive a box, that might serve me for a bedchamber,\\nafter the model that Glumdalclitch and I should agree upon. This man\\nwas a most ingenious artist, and according to my direction, in three\\nweeks finished for me a wooden chamber of sixteen feet square, and\\ntwelve high, with sash-windows, a door, and two closets, like a London\\nbed-chamber. The board, that made the ceiling, was to be lifted up and\\ndown by two hinges, to put in a bed ready furnished by her majesty’s\\nupholsterer, which Glumdalclitch took out every day to air, made it\\nwith her own hands, and letting it down at night, locked up the roof\\nover me. A nice workman, who was famous for little curiosities,\\nundertook to make me two chairs, with backs and frames, of a substance\\nnot unlike ivory, and two tables, with a cabinet to put my things in.\\nThe room was quilted on all sides, as well as the floor and the\\nceiling, to prevent any accident from the carelessness of those who\\ncarried me, and to break the force of a jolt, when I went in a coach. I\\ndesired a lock for my door, to prevent rats and mice from coming in.\\nThe smith, after several attempts, made the smallest that ever was seen\\namong them, for I have known a larger at the gate of a gentleman’s\\nhouse in England. I made a shift to keep the key in a pocket of my own,\\nfearing Glumdalclitch might lose it. The queen likewise ordered the\\nthinnest silks that could be gotten, to make me clothes, not much\\nthicker than an English blanket, very cumbersome till I was accustomed\\nto them. They were after the fashion of the kingdom, partly resembling\\nthe Persian, and partly the Chinese, and are a very grave and decent\\nhabit.\\n\\nThe queen became so fond of my company, that she could not dine without\\nme. I had a table placed upon the same at which her majesty ate, just\\nat her left elbow, and a chair to sit on. Glumdalclitch stood on a\\nstool on the floor near my table, to assist and take care of me. I had\\nan entire set of silver dishes and plates, and other necessaries,\\nwhich, in proportion to those of the queen, were not much bigger than\\nwhat I have seen in a London toy-shop for the furniture of a\\nbaby-house: these my little nurse kept in her pocket in a silver box,\\nand gave me at meals as I wanted them, always cleaning them herself. No\\nperson dined with the queen but the two princesses royal, the eldest\\nsixteen years old, and the younger at that time thirteen and a month.\\nHer majesty used to put a bit of meat upon one of my dishes, out of\\nwhich I carved for myself, and her diversion was to see me eat in\\nminiature: for the queen (who had indeed but a weak stomach) took up,\\nat one mouthful, as much as a dozen English farmers could eat at a\\nmeal, which to me was for some time a very nauseous sight. She would\\ncraunch the wing of a lark, bones and all, between her teeth, although\\nit were nine times as large as that of a full-grown turkey; and put a\\nbit of bread into her mouth as big as two twelve-penny loaves. She\\ndrank out of a golden cup, above a hogshead at a draught. Her knives\\nwere twice as long as a scythe, set straight upon the handle. The\\nspoons, forks, and other instruments, were all in the same proportion.\\nI remember when Glumdalclitch carried me, out of curiosity, to see some\\nof the tables at court, where ten or a dozen of those enormous knives\\nand forks were lifted up together, I thought I had never till then\\nbeheld so terrible a sight.\\n\\nIt is the custom, that every Wednesday (which, as I have observed, is\\ntheir Sabbath) the king and queen, with the royal issue of both sexes,\\ndine together in the apartment of his majesty, to whom I was now become\\na great favourite; and at these times, my little chair and table were\\nplaced at his left hand, before one of the salt-cellars. This prince\\ntook a pleasure in conversing with me, inquiring into the manners,\\nreligion, laws, government, and learning of Europe; wherein I gave him\\nthe best account I was able. His apprehension was so clear, and his\\njudgment so exact, that he made very wise reflections and observations\\nupon all I said. But I confess, that, after I had been a little too\\ncopious in talking of my own beloved country, of our trade and wars by\\nsea and land, of our schisms in religion, and parties in the state; the\\nprejudices of his education prevailed so far, that he could not forbear\\ntaking me up in his right hand, and stroking me gently with the other,\\nafter a hearty fit of laughing, asked me, “whether I was a whig or\\ntory?” Then turning to his first minister, who waited behind him with a\\nwhite staff, near as tall as the mainmast of the Royal Sovereign, he\\nobserved “how contemptible a thing was human grandeur, which could be\\nmimicked by such diminutive insects as I: and yet,” says he, “I dare\\nengage these creatures have their titles and distinctions of honour;\\nthey contrive little nests and burrows, that they call houses and\\ncities; they make a figure in dress and equipage; they love, they\\nfight, they dispute, they cheat, they betray!” And thus he continued\\non, while my colour came and went several times, with indignation, to\\nhear our noble country, the mistress of arts and arms, the scourge of\\nFrance, the arbitress of Europe, the seat of virtue, piety, honour, and\\ntruth, the pride and envy of the world, so contemptuously treated.\\n\\nBut as I was not in a condition to resent injuries, so upon mature\\nthoughts I began to doubt whether I was injured or no. For, after\\nhaving been accustomed several months to the sight and converse of this\\npeople, and observed every object upon which I cast my eyes to be of\\nproportionable magnitude, the horror I had at first conceived from\\ntheir bulk and aspect was so far worn off, that if I had then beheld a\\ncompany of English lords and ladies in their finery and birth-day\\nclothes, acting their several parts in the most courtly manner of\\nstrutting, and bowing, and prating, to say the truth, I should have\\nbeen strongly tempted to laugh as much at them as the king and his\\ngrandees did at me. Neither, indeed, could I forbear smiling at myself,\\nwhen the queen used to place me upon her hand towards a looking-glass,\\nby which both our persons appeared before me in full view together; and\\nthere could be nothing more ridiculous than the comparison; so that I\\nreally began to imagine myself dwindled many degrees below my usual\\nsize.\\n\\nNothing angered and mortified me so much as the queen’s dwarf; who\\nbeing of the lowest stature that was ever in that country (for I verily\\nthink he was not full thirty feet high), became so insolent at seeing a\\ncreature so much beneath him, that he would always affect to swagger\\nand look big as he passed by me in the queen’s antechamber, while I was\\nstanding on some table talking with the lords or ladies of the court,\\nand he seldom failed of a smart word or two upon my littleness; against\\nwhich I could only revenge myself by calling him brother, challenging\\nhim to wrestle, and such repartees as are usually in the mouths of\\ncourt pages. One day, at dinner, this malicious little cub was so\\nnettled with something I had said to him, that, raising himself upon\\nthe frame of her majesty’s chair, he took me up by the middle, as I was\\nsitting down, not thinking any harm, and let me drop into a large\\nsilver bowl of cream, and then ran away as fast as he could. I fell\\nover head and ears, and, if I had not been a good swimmer, it might\\nhave gone very hard with me; for Glumdalclitch in that instant happened\\nto be at the other end of the room, and the queen was in such a fright,\\nthat she wanted presence of mind to assist me. But my little nurse ran\\nto my relief, and took me out, after I had swallowed above a quart of\\ncream. I was put to bed: however, I received no other damage than the\\nloss of a suit of clothes, which was utterly spoiled. The dwarf was\\nsoundly whipt, and as a farther punishment, forced to drink up the bowl\\nof cream into which he had thrown me: neither was he ever restored to\\nfavour; for soon after the queen bestowed him on a lady of high\\nquality, so that I saw him no more, to my very great satisfaction; for\\nI could not tell to what extremities such a malicious urchin might have\\ncarried his resentment.\\n\\nHe had before served me a scurvy trick, which set the queen a-laughing,\\nalthough at the same time she was heartily vexed, and would have\\nimmediately cashiered him, if I had not been so generous as to\\nintercede. Her majesty had taken a marrow-bone upon her plate, and,\\nafter knocking out the marrow, placed the bone again in the dish erect,\\nas it stood before; the dwarf, watching his opportunity, while\\nGlumdalclitch was gone to the side-board, mounted the stool that she\\nstood on to take care of me at meals, took me up in both hands, and\\nsqueezing my legs together, wedged them into the marrow bone above my\\nwaist, where I stuck for some time, and made a very ridiculous figure.\\nI believe it was near a minute before any one knew what was become of\\nme; for I thought it below me to cry out. But, as princes seldom get\\ntheir meat hot, my legs were not scalded, only my stockings and\\nbreeches in a sad condition. The dwarf, at my entreaty, had no other\\npunishment than a sound whipping.\\n\\nI was frequently rallied by the queen upon account of my fearfulness;\\nand she used to ask me whether the people of my country were as great\\ncowards as myself? The occasion was this: the kingdom is much pestered\\nwith flies in summer; and these odious insects, each of them as big as\\na Dunstable lark, hardly gave me any rest while I sat at dinner, with\\ntheir continual humming and buzzing about mine ears. They would\\nsometimes alight upon my victuals, and leave their loathsome excrement,\\nor spawn behind, which to me was very visible, though not to the\\nnatives of that country, whose large optics were not so acute as mine,\\nin viewing smaller objects. Sometimes they would fix upon my nose, or\\nforehead, where they stung me to the quick, smelling very offensively;\\nand I could easily trace that viscous matter, which, our naturalists\\ntell us, enables those creatures to walk with their feet upwards upon a\\nceiling. I had much ado to defend myself against these detestable\\nanimals, and could not forbear starting when they came on my face. It\\nwas the common practice of the dwarf, to catch a number of these\\ninsects in his hand, as schoolboys do among us, and let them out\\nsuddenly under my nose, on purpose to frighten me, and divert the\\nqueen. My remedy was to cut them in pieces with my knife, as they flew\\nin the air, wherein my dexterity was much admired.\\n\\nI remember, one morning, when Glumdalclitch had set me in a box upon a\\nwindow, as she usually did in fair days to give me air (for I durst not\\nventure to let the box be hung on a nail out of the window, as we do\\nwith cages in England), after I had lifted up one of my sashes, and sat\\ndown at my table to eat a piece of sweet cake for my breakfast, above\\ntwenty wasps, allured by the smell, came flying into the room, humming\\nlouder than the drones of as many bagpipes. Some of them seized my\\ncake, and carried it piecemeal away; others flew about my head and\\nface, confounding me with the noise, and putting me in the utmost\\nterror of their stings. However, I had the courage to rise and draw my\\nhanger, and attack them in the air. I dispatched four of them, but the\\nrest got away, and I presently shut my window. These insects were as\\nlarge as partridges: I took out their stings, found them an inch and a\\nhalf long, and as sharp as needles. I carefully preserved them all; and\\nhaving since shown them, with some other curiosities, in several parts\\nof Europe, upon my return to England I gave three of them to Gresham\\nCollege, and kept the fourth for myself.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\nThe country described. A proposal for correcting modern maps. The\\nking’s palace; and some account of the metropolis. The author’s way of\\ntravelling. The chief temple described.\\n\\n\\nI now intend to give the reader a short description of this country, as\\nfar as I travelled in it, which was not above two thousand miles round\\nLorbrulgrud, the metropolis. For the queen, whom I always attended,\\nnever went farther when she accompanied the king in his progresses, and\\nthere staid till his majesty returned from viewing his frontiers. The\\nwhole extent of this prince’s dominions reaches about six thousand\\nmiles in length, and from three to five in breadth: whence I cannot but\\nconclude, that our geographers of Europe are in a great error, by\\nsupposing nothing but sea between Japan and California; for it was ever\\nmy opinion, that there must be a balance of earth to counterpoise the\\ngreat continent of Tartary; and therefore they ought to correct their\\nmaps and charts, by joining this vast tract of land to the north-west\\nparts of America, wherein I shall be ready to lend them my assistance.\\n\\nThe kingdom is a peninsula, terminated to the north-east by a ridge of\\nmountains thirty miles high, which are altogether impassable, by reason\\nof the volcanoes upon the tops: neither do the most learned know what\\nsort of mortals inhabit beyond those mountains, or whether they be\\ninhabited at all. On the three other sides, it is bounded by the ocean.\\nThere is not one seaport in the whole kingdom: and those parts of the\\ncoasts into which the rivers issue, are so full of pointed rocks, and\\nthe sea generally so rough, that there is no venturing with the\\nsmallest of their boats; so that these people are wholly excluded from\\nany commerce with the rest of the world. But the large rivers are full\\nof vessels, and abound with excellent fish; for they seldom get any\\nfrom the sea, because the sea fish are of the same size with those in\\nEurope, and consequently not worth catching; whereby it is manifest,\\nthat nature, in the production of plants and animals of so\\nextraordinary a bulk, is wholly confined to this continent, of which I\\nleave the reasons to be determined by philosophers. However, now and\\nthen they take a whale that happens to be dashed against the rocks,\\nwhich the common people feed on heartily. These whales I have known so\\nlarge, that a man could hardly carry one upon his shoulders; and\\nsometimes, for curiosity, they are brought in hampers to Lorbrulgrud; I\\nsaw one of them in a dish at the king’s table, which passed for a\\nrarity, but I did not observe he was fond of it; for I think, indeed,\\nthe bigness disgusted him, although I have seen one somewhat larger in\\nGreenland.\\n\\nThe country is well inhabited, for it contains fifty-one cities, near a\\nhundred walled towns, and a great number of villages. To satisfy my\\ncurious reader, it may be sufficient to describe Lorbrulgrud. This city\\nstands upon almost two equal parts, on each side the river that passes\\nthrough. It contains above eighty thousand houses, and about six\\nhundred thousand inhabitants. It is in length three _glomglungs_ (which\\nmake about fifty-four English miles,) and two and a half in breadth; as\\nI measured it myself in the royal map made by the king’s order, which\\nwas laid on the ground on purpose for me, and extended a hundred feet:\\nI paced the diameter and circumference several times barefoot, and,\\ncomputing by the scale, measured it pretty exactly.\\n\\nThe king’s palace is no regular edifice, but a heap of buildings, about\\nseven miles round: the chief rooms are generally two hundred and forty\\nfeet high, and broad and long in proportion. A coach was allowed to\\nGlumdalclitch and me, wherein her governess frequently took her out to\\nsee the town, or go among the shops; and I was always of the party,\\ncarried in my box; although the girl, at my own desire, would often\\ntake me out, and hold me in her hand, that I might more conveniently\\nview the houses and the people, as we passed along the streets. I\\nreckoned our coach to be about a square of Westminster-hall, but not\\naltogether so high: however, I cannot be very exact. One day the\\ngoverness ordered our coachman to stop at several shops, where the\\nbeggars, watching their opportunity, crowded to the sides of the coach,\\nand gave me the most horrible spectacle that ever a European eye\\nbeheld. There was a woman with a cancer in her breast, swelled to a\\nmonstrous size, full of holes, in two or three of which I could have\\neasily crept, and covered my whole body. There was a fellow with a wen\\nin his neck, larger than five wool-packs; and another, with a couple of\\nwooden legs, each about twenty feet high. But the most hateful sight of\\nall, was the lice crawling on their clothes. I could see distinctly the\\nlimbs of these vermin with my naked eye, much better than those of a\\nEuropean louse through a microscope, and their snouts with which they\\nrooted like swine. They were the first I had ever beheld, and I should\\nhave been curious enough to dissect one of them, if I had had proper\\ninstruments, which I unluckily left behind me in the ship, although,\\nindeed, the sight was so nauseous, that it perfectly turned my stomach.\\n\\nBesides the large box in which I was usually carried, the queen ordered\\na smaller one to be made for me, of about twelve feet square, and ten\\nhigh, for the convenience of travelling; because the other was somewhat\\ntoo large for Glumdalclitch’s lap, and cumbersome in the coach; it was\\nmade by the same artist, whom I directed in the whole contrivance. This\\ntravelling-closet was an exact square, with a window in the middle of\\nthree of the squares, and each window was latticed with iron wire on\\nthe outside, to prevent accidents in long journeys. On the fourth side,\\nwhich had no window, two strong staples were fixed, through which the\\nperson that carried me, when I had a mind to be on horseback, put a\\nleathern belt, and buckled it about his waist. This was always the\\noffice of some grave trusty servant, in whom I could confide, whether I\\nattended the king and queen in their progresses, or were disposed to\\nsee the gardens, or pay a visit to some great lady or minister of state\\nin the court, when Glumdalclitch happened to be out of order; for I\\nsoon began to be known and esteemed among the greatest officers, I\\nsuppose more upon account of their majesties’ favour, than any merit of\\nmy own. In journeys, when I was weary of the coach, a servant on\\nhorseback would buckle on my box, and place it upon a cushion before\\nhim; and there I had a full prospect of the country on three sides,\\nfrom my three windows. I had, in this closet, a field-bed and a\\nhammock, hung from the ceiling, two chairs and a table, neatly screwed\\nto the floor, to prevent being tossed about by the agitation of the\\nhorse or the coach. And having been long used to sea-voyages, those\\nmotions, although sometimes very violent, did not much discompose me.\\n\\nWhenever I had a mind to see the town, it was always in my\\ntravelling-closet; which Glumdalclitch held in her lap in a kind of\\nopen sedan, after the fashion of the country, borne by four men, and\\nattended by two others in the queen’s livery. The people, who had often\\nheard of me, were very curious to crowd about the sedan, and the girl\\nwas complaisant enough to make the bearers stop, and to take me in her\\nhand, that I might be more conveniently seen.\\n\\nI was very desirous to see the chief temple, and particularly the tower\\nbelonging to it, which is reckoned the highest in the kingdom.\\nAccordingly one day my nurse carried me thither, but I may truly say I\\ncame back disappointed; for the height is not above three thousand\\nfeet, reckoning from the ground to the highest pinnacle top; which,\\nallowing for the difference between the size of those people and us in\\nEurope, is no great matter for admiration, nor at all equal in\\nproportion (if I rightly remember) to Salisbury steeple. But, not to\\ndetract from a nation, to which, during my life, I shall acknowledge\\nmyself extremely obliged, it must be allowed, that whatever this famous\\ntower wants in height, is amply made up in beauty and strength: for the\\nwalls are near a hundred feet thick, built of hewn stone, whereof each\\nis about forty feet square, and adorned on all sides with statues of\\ngods and emperors, cut in marble, larger than the life, placed in their\\nseveral niches. I measured a little finger which had fallen down from\\none of these statues, and lay unperceived among some rubbish, and found\\nit exactly four feet and an inch in length. Glumdalclitch wrapped it up\\nin her handkerchief, and carried it home in her pocket, to keep among\\nother trinkets, of which the girl was very fond, as children at her age\\nusually are.\\n\\nThe king’s kitchen is indeed a noble building, vaulted at top, and\\nabout six hundred feet high. The great oven is not so wide, by ten\\npaces, as the cupola at St. Paul’s: for I measured the latter on\\npurpose, after my return. But if I should describe the kitchen grate,\\nthe prodigious pots and kettles, the joints of meat turning on the\\nspits, with many other particulars, perhaps I should be hardly\\nbelieved; at least a severe critic would be apt to think I enlarged a\\nlittle, as travellers are often suspected to do. To avoid which censure\\nI fear I have run too much into the other extreme; and that if this\\ntreatise should happen to be translated into the language of\\nBrobdingnag (which is the general name of that kingdom,) and\\ntransmitted thither, the king and his people would have reason to\\ncomplain that I had done them an injury, by a false and diminutive\\nrepresentation.\\n\\nHis majesty seldom keeps above six hundred horses in his stables: they\\nare generally from fifty-four to sixty feet high. But, when he goes\\nabroad on solemn days, he is attended, for state, by a military guard\\nof five hundred horse, which, indeed, I thought was the most splendid\\nsight that could be ever beheld, till I saw part of his army in\\nbattalia, whereof I shall find another occasion to speak.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\nSeveral adventures that happened to the author. The execution of a\\ncriminal. The author shows his skill in navigation.\\n\\n\\nI should have lived happy enough in that country, if my littleness had\\nnot exposed me to several ridiculous and troublesome accidents; some of\\nwhich I shall venture to relate. Glumdalclitch often carried me into\\nthe gardens of the court in my smaller box, and would sometimes take me\\nout of it, and hold me in her hand, or set me down to walk. I remember,\\nbefore the dwarf left the queen, he followed us one day into those\\ngardens, and my nurse having set me down, he and I being close\\ntogether, near some dwarf apple trees, I must needs show my wit, by a\\nsilly allusion between him and the trees, which happens to hold in\\ntheir language as it does in ours. Whereupon, the malicious rogue,\\nwatching his opportunity, when I was walking under one of them, shook\\nit directly over my head, by which a dozen apples, each of them near as\\nlarge as a Bristol barrel, came tumbling about my ears; one of them hit\\nme on the back as I chanced to stoop, and knocked me down flat on my\\nface; but I received no other hurt, and the dwarf was pardoned at my\\ndesire, because I had given the provocation.\\n\\nAnother day, Glumdalclitch left me on a smooth grass-plot to divert\\nmyself, while she walked at some distance with her governess. In the\\nmeantime, there suddenly fell such a violent shower of hail, that I was\\nimmediately, by the force of it, struck to the ground: and when I was\\ndown, the hailstones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body, as if\\nI had been pelted with tennis-balls; however, I made a shift to creep\\non all fours, and shelter myself, by lying flat on my face, on the\\nlee-side of a border of lemon-thyme, but so bruised from head to foot,\\nthat I could not go abroad in ten days. Neither is this at all to be\\nwondered at, because nature, in that country, observing the same\\nproportion through all her operations, a hailstone is near eighteen\\nhundred times as large as one in Europe; which I can assert upon\\nexperience, having been so curious as to weigh and measure them.\\n\\nBut a more dangerous accident happened to me in the same garden, when\\nmy little nurse, believing she had put me in a secure place (which I\\noften entreated her to do, that I might enjoy my own thoughts,) and\\nhaving left my box at home, to avoid the trouble of carrying it, went\\nto another part of the garden with her governess and some ladies of her\\nacquaintance. While she was absent, and out of hearing, a small white\\nspaniel that belonged to one of the chief gardeners, having got by\\naccident into the garden, happened to range near the place where I lay:\\nthe dog, following the scent, came directly up, and taking me in his\\nmouth, ran straight to his master wagging his tail, and set me gently\\non the ground. By good fortune he had been so well taught, that I was\\ncarried between his teeth without the least hurt, or even tearing my\\nclothes. But the poor gardener, who knew me well, and had a great\\nkindness for me, was in a terrible fright: he gently took me up in both\\nhis hands, and asked me how I did? but I was so amazed and out of\\nbreath, that I could not speak a word. In a few minutes I came to\\nmyself, and he carried me safe to my little nurse, who, by this time,\\nhad returned to the place where she left me, and was in cruel agonies\\nwhen I did not appear, nor answer when she called. She severely\\nreprimanded the gardener on account of his dog. But the thing was\\nhushed up, and never known at court, for the girl was afraid of the\\nqueen’s anger; and truly, as to myself, I thought it would not be for\\nmy reputation, that such a story should go about.\\n\\nThis accident absolutely determined Glumdalclitch never to trust me\\nabroad for the future out of her sight. I had been long afraid of this\\nresolution, and therefore concealed from her some little unlucky\\nadventures, that happened in those times when I was left by myself.\\nOnce a kite, hovering over the garden, made a stoop at me, and if I had\\nnot resolutely drawn my hanger, and run under a thick espalier, he\\nwould have certainly carried me away in his talons. Another time,\\nwalking to the top of a fresh mole-hill, I fell to my neck in the hole,\\nthrough which that animal had cast up the earth, and coined some lie,\\nnot worth remembering, to excuse myself for spoiling my clothes. I\\nlikewise broke my right shin against the shell of a snail, which I\\nhappened to stumble over, as I was walking alone and thinking on poor\\nEngland.\\n\\nI cannot tell whether I were more pleased or mortified to observe, in\\nthose solitary walks, that the smaller birds did not appear to be at\\nall afraid of me, but would hop about within a yard’s distance, looking\\nfor worms and other food, with as much indifference and security as if\\nno creature at all were near them. I remember, a thrush had the\\nconfidence to snatch out of my hand, with his bill, a piece of cake\\nthat Glumdalclitch had just given me for my breakfast. When I attempted\\nto catch any of these birds, they would boldly turn against me,\\nendeavouring to peck my fingers, which I durst not venture within their\\nreach; and then they would hop back unconcerned, to hunt for worms or\\nsnails, as they did before. But one day, I took a thick cudgel, and\\nthrew it with all my strength so luckily, at a linnet, that I knocked\\nhim down, and seizing him by the neck with both my hands, ran with him\\nin triumph to my nurse. However, the bird, who had only been stunned,\\nrecovering himself gave me so many boxes with his wings, on both sides\\nof my head and body, though I held him at arm’s length, and was out of\\nthe reach of his claws, that I was twenty times thinking to let him go.\\nBut I was soon relieved by one of our servants, who wrung off the\\nbird’s neck, and I had him next day for dinner, by the queen’s command.\\nThis linnet, as near as I can remember, seemed to be somewhat larger\\nthan an English swan.\\n\\nThe maids of honour often invited Glumdalclitch to their apartments,\\nand desired she would bring me along with her, on purpose to have the\\npleasure of seeing and touching me. They would often strip me naked\\nfrom top to toe, and lay me at full length in their bosoms; wherewith I\\nwas much disgusted because, to say the truth, a very offensive smell\\ncame from their skins; which I do not mention, or intend, to the\\ndisadvantage of those excellent ladies, for whom I have all manner of\\nrespect; but I conceive that my sense was more acute in proportion to\\nmy littleness, and that those illustrious persons were no more\\ndisagreeable to their lovers, or to each other, than people of the same\\nquality are with us in England. And, after all, I found their natural\\nsmell was much more supportable, than when they used perfumes, under\\nwhich I immediately swooned away. I cannot forget, that an intimate\\nfriend of mine in Lilliput, took the freedom in a warm day, when I had\\nused a good deal of exercise, to complain of a strong smell about me,\\nalthough I am as little faulty that way, as most of my sex: but I\\nsuppose his faculty of smelling was as nice with regard to me, as mine\\nwas to that of this people. Upon this point, I cannot forbear doing\\njustice to the queen my mistress, and Glumdalclitch my nurse, whose\\npersons were as sweet as those of any lady in England.\\n\\nThat which gave me most uneasiness among these maids of honour (when my\\nnurse carried me to visit them) was, to see them use me without any\\nmanner of ceremony, like a creature who had no sort of consequence: for\\nthey would strip themselves to the skin, and put on their smocks in my\\npresence, while I was placed on their toilet, directly before their\\nnaked bodies, which I am sure to me was very far from being a tempting\\nsight, or from giving me any other emotions than those of horror and\\ndisgust: their skins appeared so coarse and uneven, so variously\\ncoloured, when I saw them near, with a mole here and there as broad as\\na trencher, and hairs hanging from it thicker than packthreads, to say\\nnothing farther concerning the rest of their persons. Neither did they\\nat all scruple, while I was by, to discharge what they had drank, to\\nthe quantity of at least two hogsheads, in a vessel that held above\\nthree tuns. The handsomest among these maids of honour, a pleasant,\\nfrolicsome girl of sixteen, would sometimes set me astride upon one of\\nher nipples, with many other tricks, wherein the reader will excuse me\\nfor not being over particular. But I was so much displeased, that I\\nentreated Glumdalclitch to contrive some excuse for not seeing that\\nyoung lady any more.\\n\\nOne day, a young gentleman, who was nephew to my nurse’s governess,\\ncame and pressed them both to see an execution. It was of a man, who\\nhad murdered one of that gentleman’s intimate acquaintance.\\nGlumdalclitch was prevailed on to be of the company, very much against\\nher inclination, for she was naturally tender-hearted: and, as for\\nmyself, although I abhorred such kind of spectacles, yet my curiosity\\ntempted me to see something that I thought must be extraordinary. The\\nmalefactor was fixed in a chair upon a scaffold erected for that\\npurpose, and his head cut off at one blow, with a sword of about forty\\nfeet long. The veins and arteries spouted up such a prodigious quantity\\nof blood, and so high in the air, that the great _jet d’eau_ at\\nVersailles was not equal to it for the time it lasted: and the head,\\nwhen it fell on the scaffold floor, gave such a bounce as made me\\nstart, although I was at least half an English mile distant.\\n\\nThe queen, who often used to hear me talk of my sea-voyages, and took\\nall occasions to divert me when I was melancholy, asked me whether I\\nunderstood how to handle a sail or an oar, and whether a little\\nexercise of rowing might not be convenient for my health? I answered,\\nthat I understood both very well: for although my proper employment had\\nbeen to be surgeon or doctor to the ship, yet often, upon a pinch, I\\nwas forced to work like a common mariner. But I could not see how this\\ncould be done in their country, where the smallest wherry was equal to\\na first-rate man of war among us; and such a boat as I could manage\\nwould never live in any of their rivers. Her majesty said, if I would\\ncontrive a boat, her own joiner should make it, and she would provide a\\nplace for me to sail in. The fellow was an ingenious workman, and by my\\ninstructions, in ten days, finished a pleasure-boat with all its\\ntackling, able conveniently to hold eight Europeans. When it was\\nfinished, the queen was so delighted, that she ran with it in her lap\\nto the king, who ordered it to be put into a cistern full of water,\\nwith me in it, by way of trial, where I could not manage my two sculls,\\nor little oars, for want of room. But the queen had before contrived\\nanother project. She ordered the joiner to make a wooden trough of\\nthree hundred feet long, fifty broad, and eight deep; which, being well\\npitched, to prevent leaking, was placed on the floor, along the wall,\\nin an outer room of the palace. It had a cock near the bottom to let\\nout the water, when it began to grow stale; and two servants could\\neasily fill it in half an hour. Here I often used to row for my own\\ndiversion, as well as that of the queen and her ladies, who thought\\nthemselves well entertained with my skill and agility. Sometimes I\\nwould put up my sail, and then my business was only to steer, while the\\nladies gave me a gale with their fans; and, when they were weary, some\\nof their pages would blow my sail forward with their breath, while I\\nshowed my art by steering starboard or larboard as I pleased. When I\\nhad done, Glumdalclitch always carried back my boat into her closet,\\nand hung it on a nail to dry.\\n\\nIn this exercise I once met an accident, which had like to have cost me\\nmy life; for, one of the pages having put my boat into the trough, the\\ngoverness who attended Glumdalclitch very officiously lifted me up, to\\nplace me in the boat: but I happened to slip through her fingers, and\\nshould infallibly have fallen down forty feet upon the floor, if, by\\nthe luckiest chance in the world, I had not been stopped by a\\ncorking-pin that stuck in the good gentlewoman’s stomacher; the head of\\nthe pin passing between my shirt and the waistband of my breeches, and\\nthus I was held by the middle in the air, till Glumdalclitch ran to my\\nrelief.\\n\\nAnother time, one of the servants, whose office it was to fill my\\ntrough every third day with fresh water, was so careless as to let a\\nhuge frog (not perceiving it) slip out of his pail. The frog lay\\nconcealed till I was put into my boat, but then, seeing a\\nresting-place, climbed up, and made it lean so much on one side, that I\\nwas forced to balance it with all my weight on the other, to prevent\\noverturning. When the frog was got in, it hopped at once half the\\nlength of the boat, and then over my head, backward and forward,\\ndaubing my face and clothes with its odious slime. The largeness of its\\nfeatures made it appear the most deformed animal that can be conceived.\\nHowever, I desired Glumdalclitch to let me deal with it alone. I banged\\nit a good while with one of my sculls, and at last forced it to leap\\nout of the boat.\\n\\nBut the greatest danger I ever underwent in that kingdom, was from a\\nmonkey, who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen. Glumdalclitch\\nhad locked me up in her closet, while she went somewhere upon business,\\nor a visit. The weather being very warm, the closet-window was left\\nopen, as well as the windows and the door of my bigger box, in which I\\nusually lived, because of its largeness and conveniency. As I sat\\nquietly meditating at my table, I heard something bounce in at the\\ncloset-window, and skip about from one side to the other: whereat,\\nalthough I was much alarmed, yet I ventured to look out, but not\\nstirring from my seat; and then I saw this frolicsome animal frisking\\nand leaping up and down, till at last he came to my box, which he\\nseemed to view with great pleasure and curiosity, peeping in at the\\ndoor and every window. I retreated to the farther corner of my room; or\\nbox; but the monkey looking in at every side, put me in such a fright,\\nthat I wanted presence of mind to conceal myself under the bed, as I\\nmight easily have done. After some time spent in peeping, grinning, and\\nchattering, he at last espied me; and reaching one of his paws in at\\nthe door, as a cat does when she plays with a mouse, although I often\\nshifted place to avoid him, he at length seized the lappet of my coat\\n(which being made of that country silk, was very thick and strong), and\\ndragged me out. He took me up in his right fore-foot and held me as a\\nnurse does a child she is going to suckle, just as I have seen the same\\nsort of creature do with a kitten in Europe; and when I offered to\\nstruggle he squeezed me so hard, that I thought it more prudent to\\nsubmit. I have good reason to believe, that he took me for a young one\\nof his own species, by his often stroking my face very gently with his\\nother paw. In these diversions he was interrupted by a noise at the\\ncloset door, as if somebody were opening it: whereupon he suddenly\\nleaped up to the window at which he had come in, and thence upon the\\nleads and gutters, walking upon three legs, and holding me in the\\nfourth, till he clambered up to a roof that was next to ours. I heard\\nGlumdalclitch give a shriek at the moment he was carrying me out. The\\npoor girl was almost distracted: that quarter of the palace was all in\\nan uproar; the servants ran for ladders; the monkey was seen by\\nhundreds in the court, sitting upon the ridge of a building, holding me\\nlike a baby in one of his forepaws, and feeding me with the other, by\\ncramming into my mouth some victuals he had squeezed out of the bag on\\none side of his chaps, and patting me when I would not eat; whereat\\nmany of the rabble below could not forbear laughing; neither do I think\\nthey justly ought to be blamed, for, without question, the sight was\\nridiculous enough to every body but myself. Some of the people threw up\\nstones, hoping to drive the monkey down; but this was strictly\\nforbidden, or else, very probably, my brains had been dashed out.\\n\\nThe ladders were now applied, and mounted by several men; which the\\nmonkey observing, and finding himself almost encompassed, not being\\nable to make speed enough with his three legs, let me drop on a ridge\\ntile, and made his escape. Here I sat for some time, five hundred yards\\nfrom the ground, expecting every moment to be blown down by the wind,\\nor to fall by my own giddiness, and come tumbling over and over from\\nthe ridge to the eaves; but an honest lad, one of my nurse’s footmen,\\nclimbed up, and putting me into his breeches pocket, brought me down\\nsafe.\\n\\nI was almost choked with the filthy stuff the monkey had crammed down\\nmy throat: but my dear little nurse picked it out of my mouth with a\\nsmall needle, and then I fell a-vomiting, which gave me great relief.\\nYet I was so weak and bruised in the sides with the squeezes given me\\nby this odious animal, that I was forced to keep my bed a fortnight.\\nThe king, queen, and all the court, sent every day to inquire after my\\nhealth; and her majesty made me several visits during my sickness. The\\nmonkey was killed, and an order made, that no such animal should be\\nkept about the palace.\\n\\nWhen I attended the king after my recovery, to return him thanks for\\nhis favours, he was pleased to rally me a good deal upon this\\nadventure. He asked me, “what my thoughts and speculations were, while\\nI lay in the monkey’s paw; how I liked the victuals he gave me; his\\nmanner of feeding; and whether the fresh air on the roof had sharpened\\nmy stomach.” He desired to know, “what I would have done upon such an\\noccasion in my own country.” I told his majesty, “that in Europe we had\\nno monkeys, except such as were brought for curiosity from other\\nplaces, and so small, that I could deal with a dozen of them together,\\nif they presumed to attack me. And as for that monstrous animal with\\nwhom I was so lately engaged (it was indeed as large as an elephant),\\nif my fears had suffered me to think so far as to make use of my\\nhanger,” (looking fiercely, and clapping my hand on the hilt, as I\\nspoke) “when he poked his paw into my chamber, perhaps I should have\\ngiven him such a wound, as would have made him glad to withdraw it with\\nmore haste than he put it in.” This I delivered in a firm tone, like a\\nperson who was jealous lest his courage should be called in question.\\nHowever, my speech produced nothing else beside a loud laughter, which\\nall the respect due to his majesty from those about him could not make\\nthem contain. This made me reflect, how vain an attempt it is for a man\\nto endeavour to do himself honour among those who are out of all degree\\nof equality or comparison with him. And yet I have seen the moral of my\\nown behaviour very frequent in England since my return; where a little\\ncontemptible varlet, without the least title to birth, person, wit, or\\ncommon sense, shall presume to look with importance, and put himself\\nupon a foot with the greatest persons of the kingdom.\\n\\nI was every day furnishing the court with some ridiculous story: and\\nGlumdalclitch, although she loved me to excess, yet was arch enough to\\ninform the queen, whenever I committed any folly that she thought would\\nbe diverting to her majesty. The girl, who had been out of order, was\\ncarried by her governess to take the air about an hour’s distance, or\\nthirty miles from town. They alighted out of the coach near a small\\nfoot-path in a field, and Glumdalclitch setting down my travelling box,\\nI went out of it to walk. There was a cow-dung in the path, and I must\\nneed try my activity by attempting to leap over it. I took a run, but\\nunfortunately jumped short, and found myself just in the middle up to\\nmy knees. I waded through with some difficulty, and one of the footmen\\nwiped me as clean as he could with his handkerchief, for I was filthily\\nbemired; and my nurse confined me to my box, till we returned home;\\nwhere the queen was soon informed of what had passed, and the footmen\\nspread it about the court: so that all the mirth for some days was at\\nmy expense.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\nSeveral contrivances of the author to please the king and queen. He\\nshows his skill in music. The king inquires into the state of England,\\nwhich the author relates to him. The king’s observations thereon.\\n\\n\\nI used to attend the king’s levee once or twice a week, and had often\\nseen him under the barber’s hand, which indeed was at first very\\nterrible to behold; for the razor was almost twice as long as an\\nordinary scythe. His majesty, according to the custom of the country,\\nwas only shaved twice a week. I once prevailed on the barber to give me\\nsome of the suds or lather, out of which I picked forty or fifty of the\\nstrongest stumps of hair. I then took a piece of fine wood, and cut it\\nlike the back of a comb, making several holes in it at equal distances\\nwith as small a needle as I could get from Glumdalclitch. I fixed in\\nthe stumps so artificially, scraping and sloping them with my knife\\ntoward the points, that I made a very tolerable comb; which was a\\nseasonable supply, my own being so much broken in the teeth, that it\\nwas almost useless: neither did I know any artist in that country so\\nnice and exact, as would undertake to make me another.\\n\\nAnd this puts me in mind of an amusement, wherein I spent many of my\\nleisure hours. I desired the queen’s woman to save for me the combings\\nof her majesty’s hair, whereof in time I got a good quantity; and\\nconsulting with my friend the cabinet-maker, who had received general\\norders to do little jobs for me, I directed him to make two\\nchair-frames, no larger than those I had in my box, and to bore little\\nholes with a fine awl, round those parts where I designed the backs and\\nseats; through these holes I wove the strongest hairs I could pick out,\\njust after the manner of cane chairs in England. When they were\\nfinished, I made a present of them to her majesty; who kept them in her\\ncabinet, and used to show them for curiosities, as indeed they were the\\nwonder of every one that beheld them. The queen would have me sit upon\\none of these chairs, but I absolutely refused to obey her, protesting I\\nwould rather die than place a dishonourable part of my body on those\\nprecious hairs, that once adorned her majesty’s head. Of these hairs\\n(as I had always a mechanical genius) I likewise made a neat little\\npurse, about five feet long, with her majesty’s name deciphered in gold\\nletters, which I gave to Glumdalclitch, by the queen’s consent. To say\\nthe truth, it was more for show than use, being not of strength to bear\\nthe weight of the larger coins, and therefore she kept nothing in it\\nbut some little toys that girls are fond of.\\n\\nThe king, who delighted in music, had frequent concerts at court, to\\nwhich I was sometimes carried, and set in my box on a table to hear\\nthem: but the noise was so great that I could hardly distinguish the\\ntunes. I am confident that all the drums and trumpets of a royal army,\\nbeating and sounding together just at your ears, could not equal it. My\\npractice was to have my box removed from the place where the performers\\nsat, as far as I could, then to shut the doors and windows of it, and\\ndraw the window curtains; after which I found their music not\\ndisagreeable.\\n\\nI had learned in my youth to play a little upon the spinet.\\nGlumdalclitch kept one in her chamber, and a master attended twice a\\nweek to teach her: I called it a spinet, because it somewhat resembled\\nthat instrument, and was played upon in the same manner. A fancy came\\ninto my head, that I would entertain the king and queen with an English\\ntune upon this instrument. But this appeared extremely difficult: for\\nthe spinet was near sixty feet long, each key being almost a foot wide,\\nso that with my arms extended I could not reach to above five keys, and\\nto press them down required a good smart stroke with my fist, which\\nwould be too great a labour, and to no purpose. The method I contrived\\nwas this: I prepared two round sticks, about the bigness of common\\ncudgels; they were thicker at one end than the other, and I covered the\\nthicker ends with pieces of a mouse’s skin, that by rapping on them I\\nmight neither damage the tops of the keys nor interrupt the sound.\\nBefore the spinet a bench was placed, about four feet below the keys,\\nand I was put upon the bench. I ran sideling upon it, that way and\\nthis, as fast as I could, banging the proper keys with my two sticks,\\nand made a shift to play a jig, to the great satisfaction of both their\\nmajesties; but it was the most violent exercise I ever underwent; and\\nyet I could not strike above sixteen keys, nor consequently play the\\nbass and treble together, as other artists do; which was a great\\ndisadvantage to my performance.\\n\\nThe king, who, as I before observed, was a prince of excellent\\nunderstanding, would frequently order that I should be brought in my\\nbox, and set upon the table in his closet: he would then command me to\\nbring one of my chairs out of the box, and sit down within three yards\\ndistance upon the top of the cabinet, which brought me almost to a\\nlevel with his face. In this manner I had several conversations with\\nhim. I one day took the freedom to tell his majesty, “that the contempt\\nhe discovered towards Europe, and the rest of the world, did not seem\\nanswerable to those excellent qualities of mind that he was master of;\\nthat reason did not extend itself with the bulk of the body; on the\\ncontrary, we observed in our country, that the tallest persons were\\nusually the least provided with it; that among other animals, bees and\\nants had the reputation of more industry, art, and sagacity, than many\\nof the larger kinds; and that, as inconsiderable as he took me to be, I\\nhoped I might live to do his majesty some signal service.” The king\\nheard me with attention, and began to conceive a much better opinion of\\nme than he had ever before. He desired “I would give him as exact an\\naccount of the government of England as I possibly could; because, as\\nfond as princes commonly are of their own customs (for so he\\nconjectured of other monarchs, by my former discourses), he should be\\nglad to hear of any thing that might deserve imitation.”\\n\\nImagine with thyself, courteous reader, how often I then wished for the\\ntongue of Demosthenes or Cicero, that might have enabled me to\\ncelebrate the praise of my own dear native country in a style equal to\\nits merits and felicity.\\n\\nI began my discourse by informing his majesty, that our dominions\\nconsisted of two islands, which composed three mighty kingdoms, under\\none sovereign, beside our plantations in America. I dwelt long upon the\\nfertility of our soil, and the temperature of our climate. I then spoke\\nat large upon the constitution of an English parliament; partly made up\\nof an illustrious body called the House of Peers; persons of the\\nnoblest blood, and of the most ancient and ample patrimonies. I\\ndescribed that extraordinary care always taken of their education in\\narts and arms, to qualify them for being counsellors both to the king\\nand kingdom; to have a share in the legislature; to be members of the\\nhighest court of judicature, whence there can be no appeal; and to be\\nchampions always ready for the defence of their prince and country, by\\ntheir valour, conduct, and fidelity. That these were the ornament and\\nbulwark of the kingdom, worthy followers of their most renowned\\nancestors, whose honour had been the reward of their virtue, from which\\ntheir posterity were never once known to degenerate. To these were\\njoined several holy persons, as part of that assembly, under the title\\nof bishops, whose peculiar business is to take care of religion, and of\\nthose who instruct the people therein. These were searched and sought\\nout through the whole nation, by the prince and his wisest counsellors,\\namong such of the priesthood as were most deservedly distinguished by\\nthe sanctity of their lives, and the depth of their erudition; who were\\nindeed the spiritual fathers of the clergy and the people.\\n\\nThat the other part of the parliament consisted of an assembly called\\nthe House of Commons, who were all principal gentlemen, freely picked\\nand culled out by the people themselves, for their great abilities and\\nlove of their country, to represent the wisdom of the whole nation. And\\nthat these two bodies made up the most august assembly in Europe; to\\nwhom, in conjunction with the prince, the whole legislature is\\ncommitted.\\n\\nI then descended to the courts of justice; over which the judges, those\\nvenerable sages and interpreters of the law, presided, for determining\\nthe disputed rights and properties of men, as well as for the\\npunishment of vice and protection of innocence. I mentioned the prudent\\nmanagement of our treasury; the valour and achievements of our forces,\\nby sea and land. I computed the number of our people, by reckoning how\\nmany millions there might be of each religious sect, or political party\\namong us. I did not omit even our sports and pastimes, or any other\\nparticular which I thought might redound to the honour of my country.\\nAnd I finished all with a brief historical account of affairs and\\nevents in England for about a hundred years past.\\n\\nThis conversation was not ended under five audiences, each of several\\nhours; and the king heard the whole with great attention, frequently\\ntaking notes of what I spoke, as well as memorandums of what questions\\nhe intended to ask me.\\n\\nWhen I had put an end to these long discourses, his majesty, in a sixth\\naudience, consulting his notes, proposed many doubts, queries, and\\nobjections, upon every article. He asked, “What methods were used to\\ncultivate the minds and bodies of our young nobility, and in what kind\\nof business they commonly spent the first and teachable parts of their\\nlives? What course was taken to supply that assembly, when any noble\\nfamily became extinct? What qualifications were necessary in those who\\nare to be created new lords: whether the humour of the prince, a sum of\\nmoney to a court lady, or a design of strengthening a party opposite to\\nthe public interest, ever happened to be the motive in those\\nadvancements? What share of knowledge these lords had in the laws of\\ntheir country, and how they came by it, so as to enable them to decide\\nthe properties of their fellow-subjects in the last resort? Whether\\nthey were always so free from avarice, partialities, or want, that a\\nbribe, or some other sinister view, could have no place among them?\\nWhether those holy lords I spoke of were always promoted to that rank\\nupon account of their knowledge in religious matters, and the sanctity\\nof their lives; had never been compliers with the times, while they\\nwere common priests; or slavish prostitute chaplains to some nobleman,\\nwhose opinions they continued servilely to follow, after they were\\nadmitted into that assembly?”\\n\\nHe then desired to know, “What arts were practised in electing those\\nwhom I called commoners: whether a stranger, with a strong purse, might\\nnot influence the vulgar voters to choose him before their own\\nlandlord, or the most considerable gentleman in the neighbourhood? How\\nit came to pass, that people were so violently bent upon getting into\\nthis assembly, which I allowed to be a great trouble and expense, often\\nto the ruin of their families, without any salary or pension? because\\nthis appeared such an exalted strain of virtue and public spirit, that\\nhis majesty seemed to doubt it might possibly not be always sincere.”\\nAnd he desired to know, “Whether such zealous gentlemen could have any\\nviews of refunding themselves for the charges and trouble they were at\\nby sacrificing the public good to the designs of a weak and vicious\\nprince, in conjunction with a corrupted ministry?” He multiplied his\\nquestions, and sifted me thoroughly upon every part of this head,\\nproposing numberless inquiries and objections, which I think it not\\nprudent or convenient to repeat.\\n\\nUpon what I said in relation to our courts of justice, his majesty\\ndesired to be satisfied in several points: and this I was the better\\nable to do, having been formerly almost ruined by a long suit in\\nchancery, which was decreed for me with costs. He asked, “What time was\\nusually spent in determining between right and wrong, and what degree\\nof expense? Whether advocates and orators had liberty to plead in\\ncauses manifestly known to be unjust, vexatious, or oppressive? Whether\\nparty, in religion or politics, were observed to be of any weight in\\nthe scale of justice? Whether those pleading orators were persons\\neducated in the general knowledge of equity, or only in provincial,\\nnational, and other local customs? Whether they or their judges had any\\npart in penning those laws, which they assumed the liberty of\\ninterpreting, and glossing upon at their pleasure? Whether they had\\never, at different times, pleaded for and against the same cause, and\\ncited precedents to prove contrary opinions? Whether they were a rich\\nor a poor corporation? Whether they received any pecuniary reward for\\npleading, or delivering their opinions? And particularly, whether they\\nwere ever admitted as members in the lower senate?”\\n\\nHe fell next upon the management of our treasury; and said, “he thought\\nmy memory had failed me, because I computed our taxes at about five or\\nsix millions a year, and when I came to mention the issues, he found\\nthey sometimes amounted to more than double; for the notes he had taken\\nwere very particular in this point, because he hoped, as he told me,\\nthat the knowledge of our conduct might be useful to him, and he could\\nnot be deceived in his calculations. But, if what I told him were true,\\nhe was still at a loss how a kingdom could run out of its estate, like\\na private person.” He asked me, “who were our creditors; and where we\\nfound money to pay them?” He wondered to hear me talk of such\\nchargeable and expensive wars; “that certainly we must be a quarrelsome\\npeople, or live among very bad neighbours, and that our generals must\\nneeds be richer than our kings.” He asked, what business we had out of\\nour own islands, unless upon the score of trade, or treaty, or to\\ndefend the coasts with our fleet?” Above all, he was amazed to hear me\\ntalk of a mercenary standing army, in the midst of peace, and among a\\nfree people. He said, “if we were governed by our own consent, in the\\npersons of our representatives, he could not imagine of whom we were\\nafraid, or against whom we were to fight; and would hear my opinion,\\nwhether a private man’s house might not be better defended by himself,\\nhis children, and family, than by half-a-dozen rascals, picked up at a\\nventure in the streets for small wages, who might get a hundred times\\nmore by cutting their throats?”\\n\\nHe laughed at my “odd kind of arithmetic,” as he was pleased to call\\nit, “in reckoning the numbers of our people, by a computation drawn\\nfrom the several sects among us, in religion and politics.” He said,\\n“he knew no reason why those, who entertain opinions prejudicial to the\\npublic, should be obliged to change, or should not be obliged to\\nconceal them. And as it was tyranny in any government to require the\\nfirst, so it was weakness not to enforce the second: for a man may be\\nallowed to keep poisons in his closet, but not to vend them about for\\ncordials.”\\n\\nHe observed, “that among the diversions of our nobility and gentry, I\\nhad mentioned gaming: he desired to know at what age this entertainment\\nwas usually taken up, and when it was laid down; how much of their time\\nit employed; whether it ever went so high as to affect their fortunes;\\nwhether mean, vicious people, by their dexterity in that art, might not\\narrive at great riches, and sometimes keep our very nobles in\\ndependence, as well as habituate them to vile companions, wholly take\\nthem from the improvement of their minds, and force them, by the losses\\nthey received, to learn and practise that infamous dexterity upon\\nothers?”\\n\\nHe was perfectly astonished with the historical account I gave him of\\nour affairs during the last century; protesting “it was only a heap of\\nconspiracies, rebellions, murders, massacres, revolutions, banishments,\\nthe very worst effects that avarice, faction, hypocrisy,\\nperfidiousness, cruelty, rage, madness, hatred, envy, lust, malice, and\\nambition, could produce.”\\n\\nHis majesty, in another audience, was at the pains to recapitulate the\\nsum of all I had spoken; compared the questions he made with the\\nanswers I had given; then taking me into his hands, and stroking me\\ngently, delivered himself in these words, which I shall never forget,\\nnor the manner he spoke them in: “My little friend Grildrig, you have\\nmade a most admirable panegyric upon your country; you have clearly\\nproved, that ignorance, idleness, and vice, are the proper ingredients\\nfor qualifying a legislator; that laws are best explained, interpreted,\\nand applied, by those whose interest and abilities lie in perverting,\\nconfounding, and eluding them. I observe among you some lines of an\\ninstitution, which, in its original, might have been tolerable, but\\nthese half erased, and the rest wholly blurred and blotted by\\ncorruptions. It does not appear, from all you have said, how any one\\nperfection is required toward the procurement of any one station among\\nyou; much less, that men are ennobled on account of their virtue; that\\npriests are advanced for their piety or learning; soldiers, for their\\nconduct or valour; judges, for their integrity; senators, for the love\\nof their country; or counsellors for their wisdom. As for yourself,”\\ncontinued the king, “who have spent the greatest part of your life in\\ntravelling, I am well disposed to hope you may hitherto have escaped\\nmany vices of your country. But by what I have gathered from your own\\nrelation, and the answers I have with much pains wrung and extorted\\nfrom you, I cannot but conclude the bulk of your natives to be the most\\npernicious race of little odious vermin that nature ever suffered to\\ncrawl upon the surface of the earth.”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\nThe author’s love of his country. He makes a proposal of much advantage\\nto the king, which is rejected. The king’s great ignorance in politics.\\nThe learning of that country very imperfect and confined. The laws, and\\nmilitary affairs, and parties in the state.\\n\\n\\nNothing but an extreme love of truth could have hindered me from\\nconcealing this part of my story. It was in vain to discover my\\nresentments, which were always turned into ridicule; and I was forced\\nto rest with patience, while my noble and beloved country was so\\ninjuriously treated. I am as heartily sorry as any of my readers can\\npossibly be, that such an occasion was given: but this prince happened\\nto be so curious and inquisitive upon every particular, that it could\\nnot consist either with gratitude or good manners, to refuse giving him\\nwhat satisfaction I was able. Yet thus much I may be allowed to say in\\nmy own vindication, that I artfully eluded many of his questions, and\\ngave to every point a more favourable turn, by many degrees, than the\\nstrictness of truth would allow. For I have always borne that laudable\\npartiality to my own country, which Dionysius Halicarnassensis, with so\\nmuch justice, recommends to an historian: I would hide the frailties\\nand deformities of my political mother, and place her virtues and\\nbeauties in the most advantageous light. This was my sincere endeavour\\nin those many discourses I had with that monarch, although it\\nunfortunately failed of success.\\n\\nBut great allowances should be given to a king, who lives wholly\\nsecluded from the rest of the world, and must therefore be altogether\\nunacquainted with the manners and customs that most prevail in other\\nnations: the want of which knowledge will ever produce many prejudices,\\nand a certain narrowness of thinking, from which we, and the politer\\ncountries of Europe, are wholly exempted. And it would be hard indeed,\\nif so remote a prince’s notions of virtue and vice were to be offered\\nas a standard for all mankind.\\n\\nTo confirm what I have now said, and further to show the miserable\\neffects of a confined education, I shall here insert a passage, which\\nwill hardly obtain belief. In hopes to ingratiate myself further into\\nhis majesty’s favour, I told him of “an invention, discovered between\\nthree and four hundred years ago, to make a certain powder, into a heap\\nof which, the smallest spark of fire falling, would kindle the whole in\\na moment, although it were as big as a mountain, and make it all fly up\\nin the air together, with a noise and agitation greater than thunder.\\nThat a proper quantity of this powder rammed into a hollow tube of\\nbrass or iron, according to its bigness, would drive a ball of iron or\\nlead, with such violence and speed, as nothing was able to sustain its\\nforce. That the largest balls thus discharged, would not only destroy\\nwhole ranks of an army at once, but batter the strongest walls to the\\nground, sink down ships, with a thousand men in each, to the bottom of\\nthe sea, and when linked together by a chain, would cut through masts\\nand rigging, divide hundreds of bodies in the middle, and lay all waste\\nbefore them. That we often put this powder into large hollow balls of\\niron, and discharged them by an engine into some city we were\\nbesieging, which would rip up the pavements, tear the houses to pieces,\\nburst and throw splinters on every side, dashing out the brains of all\\nwho came near. That I knew the ingredients very well, which were cheap\\nand common; I understood the manner of compounding them, and could\\ndirect his workmen how to make those tubes, of a size proportionable to\\nall other things in his majesty’s kingdom, and the largest need not be\\nabove a hundred feet long; twenty or thirty of which tubes, charged\\nwith the proper quantity of powder and balls, would batter down the\\nwalls of the strongest town in his dominions in a few hours, or destroy\\nthe whole metropolis, if ever it should pretend to dispute his absolute\\ncommands.” This I humbly offered to his majesty, as a small tribute of\\nacknowledgment, in turn for so many marks that I had received, of his\\nroyal favour and protection.\\n\\nThe king was struck with horror at the description I had given of those\\nterrible engines, and the proposal I had made. “He was amazed, how so\\nimpotent and grovelling an insect as I” (these were his expressions)\\n“could entertain such inhuman ideas, and in so familiar a manner, as to\\nappear wholly unmoved at all the scenes of blood and desolation which I\\nhad painted as the common effects of those destructive machines;\\nwhereof,” he said, “some evil genius, enemy to mankind, must have been\\nthe first contriver. As for himself, he protested, that although few\\nthings delighted him so much as new discoveries in art or in nature,\\nyet he would rather lose half his kingdom, than be privy to such a\\nsecret; which he commanded me, as I valued any life, never to mention\\nany more.”\\n\\nA strange effect of narrow principles and views! that a prince\\npossessed of every quality which procures veneration, love, and esteem;\\nof strong parts, great wisdom, and profound learning, endowed with\\nadmirable talents, and almost adored by his subjects, should, from a\\nnice, unnecessary scruple, whereof in Europe we can have no conception,\\nlet slip an opportunity put into his hands that would have made him\\nabsolute master of the lives, the liberties, and the fortunes of his\\npeople! Neither do I say this, with the least intention to detract from\\nthe many virtues of that excellent king, whose character, I am\\nsensible, will, on this account, be very much lessened in the opinion\\nof an English reader: but I take this defect among them to have risen\\nfrom their ignorance, by not having hitherto reduced politics into a\\nscience, as the more acute wits of Europe have done. For, I remember\\nvery well, in a discourse one day with the king, when I happened to\\nsay, “there were several thousand books among us written upon the art\\nof government,” it gave him (directly contrary to my intention) a very\\nmean opinion of our understandings. He professed both to abominate and\\ndespise all mystery, refinement, and intrigue, either in a prince or a\\nminister. He could not tell what I meant by secrets of state, where an\\nenemy, or some rival nation, were not in the case. He confined the\\nknowledge of governing within very narrow bounds, to common sense and\\nreason, to justice and lenity, to the speedy determination of civil and\\ncriminal causes; with some other obvious topics, which are not worth\\nconsidering. And he gave it for his opinion, “that whoever could make\\ntwo ears of corn, or two blades of grass, to grow upon a spot of ground\\nwhere only one grew before, would deserve better of mankind, and do\\nmore essential service to his country, than the whole race of\\npoliticians put together.”\\n\\nThe learning of this people is very defective, consisting only in\\nmorality, history, poetry, and mathematics, wherein they must be\\nallowed to excel. But the last of these is wholly applied to what may\\nbe useful in life, to the improvement of agriculture, and all\\nmechanical arts; so that among us, it would be little esteemed. And as\\nto ideas, entities, abstractions, and transcendentals, I could never\\ndrive the least conception into their heads.\\n\\nNo law in that country must exceed in words the number of letters in\\ntheir alphabet, which consists only of two and twenty. But indeed few\\nof them extend even to that length. They are expressed in the most\\nplain and simple terms, wherein those people are not mercurial enough\\nto discover above one interpretation: and to write a comment upon any\\nlaw, is a capital crime. As to the decision of civil causes, or\\nproceedings against criminals, their precedents are so few, that they\\nhave little reason to boast of any extraordinary skill in either.\\n\\nThey have had the art of printing, as well as the Chinese, time out of\\nmind: but their libraries are not very large; for that of the king,\\nwhich is reckoned the largest, does not amount to above a thousand\\nvolumes, placed in a gallery of twelve hundred feet long, whence I had\\nliberty to borrow what books I pleased. The queen’s joiner had\\ncontrived in one of Glumdalclitch’s rooms, a kind of wooden machine\\nfive-and-twenty feet high, formed like a standing ladder; the steps\\nwere each fifty feet long. It was indeed a moveable pair of stairs, the\\nlowest end placed at ten feet distance from the wall of the chamber.\\nThe book I had a mind to read, was put up leaning against the wall: I\\nfirst mounted to the upper step of the ladder, and turning my face\\ntowards the book, began at the top of the page, and so walking to the\\nright and left about eight or ten paces, according to the length of the\\nlines, till I had gotten a little below the level of my eyes, and then\\ndescending gradually till I came to the bottom: after which I mounted\\nagain, and began the other page in the same manner, and so turned over\\nthe leaf, which I could easily do with both my hands, for it was as\\nthick and stiff as a pasteboard, and in the largest folios not above\\neighteen or twenty feet long.\\n\\nTheir style is clear, masculine, and smooth, but not florid; for they\\navoid nothing more than multiplying unnecessary words, or using various\\nexpressions. I have perused many of their books, especially those in\\nhistory and morality. Among the rest, I was much diverted with a little\\nold treatise, which always lay in Glumdalclitch’s bed chamber, and\\nbelonged to her governess, a grave elderly gentlewoman, who dealt in\\nwritings of morality and devotion. The book treats of the weakness of\\nhumankind, and is in little esteem, except among the women and the\\nvulgar. However, I was curious to see what an author of that country\\ncould say upon such a subject. This writer went through all the usual\\ntopics of European moralists, showing “how diminutive, contemptible,\\nand helpless an animal was man in his own nature; how unable to defend\\nhimself from inclemencies of the air, or the fury of wild beasts: how\\nmuch he was excelled by one creature in strength, by another in speed,\\nby a third in foresight, by a fourth in industry.” He added, “that\\nnature was degenerated in these latter declining ages of the world, and\\ncould now produce only small abortive births, in comparison of those in\\nancient times.” He said “it was very reasonable to think, not only that\\nthe species of men were originally much larger, but also that there\\nmust have been giants in former ages; which, as it is asserted by\\nhistory and tradition, so it has been confirmed by huge bones and\\nskulls, casually dug up in several parts of the kingdom, far exceeding\\nthe common dwindled race of men in our days.” He argued, “that the very\\nlaws of nature absolutely required we should have been made, in the\\nbeginning of a size more large and robust; not so liable to destruction\\nfrom every little accident, of a tile falling from a house, or a stone\\ncast from the hand of a boy, or being drowned in a little brook.” From\\nthis way of reasoning, the author drew several moral applications,\\nuseful in the conduct of life, but needless here to repeat. For my own\\npart, I could not avoid reflecting how universally this talent was\\nspread, of drawing lectures in morality, or indeed rather matter of\\ndiscontent and repining, from the quarrels we raise with nature. And I\\nbelieve, upon a strict inquiry, those quarrels might be shown as\\nill-grounded among us as they are among that people.\\n\\nAs to their military affairs, they boast that the king’s army consists\\nof a hundred and seventy-six thousand foot, and thirty-two thousand\\nhorse: if that may be called an army, which is made up of tradesmen in\\nthe several cities, and farmers in the country, whose commanders are\\nonly the nobility and gentry, without pay or reward. They are indeed\\nperfect enough in their exercises, and under very good discipline,\\nwherein I saw no great merit; for how should it be otherwise, where\\nevery farmer is under the command of his own landlord, and every\\ncitizen under that of the principal men in his own city, chosen after\\nthe manner of Venice, by ballot?\\n\\nI have often seen the militia of Lorbrulgrud drawn out to exercise, in\\na great field near the city of twenty miles square. They were in all\\nnot above twenty-five thousand foot, and six thousand horse; but it was\\nimpossible for me to compute their number, considering the space of\\nground they took up. A cavalier, mounted on a large steed, might be\\nabout ninety feet high. I have seen this whole body of horse, upon a\\nword of command, draw their swords at once, and brandish them in the\\nair. Imagination can figure nothing so grand, so surprising, and so\\nastonishing! It looked as if ten thousand flashes of lightning were\\ndarting at the same time from every quarter of the sky.\\n\\nI was curious to know how this prince, to whose dominions there is no\\naccess from any other country, came to think of armies, or to teach his\\npeople the practice of military discipline. But I was soon informed,\\nboth by conversation and reading their histories; for, in the course of\\nmany ages, they have been troubled with the same disease to which the\\nwhole race of mankind is subject; the nobility often contending for\\npower, the people for liberty, and the king for absolute dominion. All\\nwhich, however happily tempered by the laws of that kingdom, have been\\nsometimes violated by each of the three parties, and have more than\\nonce occasioned civil wars; the last whereof was happily put an end to\\nby this prince’s grandfather, in a general composition; and the\\nmilitia, then settled with common consent, has been ever since kept in\\nthe strictest duty.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\nThe king and queen make a progress to the frontiers. The author attends\\nthem. The manner in which he leaves the country very particularly\\nrelated. He returns to England.\\n\\n\\nI had always a strong impulse that I should some time recover my\\nliberty, though it was impossible to conjecture by what means, or to\\nform any project with the least hope of succeeding. The ship in which I\\nsailed, was the first ever known to be driven within sight of that\\ncoast, and the king had given strict orders, that if at any time\\nanother appeared, it should be taken ashore, and with all its crew and\\npassengers brought in a tumbril to Lorbrulgrud. He was strongly bent to\\nget me a woman of my own size, by whom I might propagate the breed: but\\nI think I should rather have died than undergone the disgrace of\\nleaving a posterity to be kept in cages, like tame canary-birds, and\\nperhaps, in time, sold about the kingdom, to persons of quality, for\\ncuriosities. I was indeed treated with much kindness: I was the\\nfavourite of a great king and queen, and the delight of the whole\\ncourt; but it was upon such a foot as ill became the dignity of\\nhumankind. I could never forget those domestic pledges I had left\\nbehind me. I wanted to be among people, with whom I could converse upon\\neven terms, and walk about the streets and fields without being afraid\\nof being trod to death like a frog or a young puppy. But my deliverance\\ncame sooner than I expected, and in a manner not very common; the whole\\nstory and circumstances of which I shall faithfully relate.\\n\\nI had now been two years in this country; and about the beginning of\\nthe third, Glumdalclitch and I attended the king and queen, in a\\nprogress to the south coast of the kingdom. I was carried, as usual, in\\nmy travelling-box, which as I have already described, was a very\\nconvenient closet, of twelve feet wide. And I had ordered a hammock to\\nbe fixed, by silken ropes from the four corners at the top, to break\\nthe jolts, when a servant carried me before him on horseback, as I\\nsometimes desired; and would often sleep in my hammock, while we were\\nupon the road. On the roof of my closet, not directly over the middle\\nof the hammock, I ordered the joiner to cut out a hole of a foot\\nsquare, to give me air in hot weather, as I slept; which hole I shut at\\npleasure with a board that drew backward and forward through a groove.\\n\\nWhen we came to our journey’s end, the king thought proper to pass a\\nfew days at a palace he has near Flanflasnic, a city within eighteen\\nEnglish miles of the seaside. Glumdalclitch and I were much fatigued: I\\nhad gotten a small cold, but the poor girl was so ill as to be confined\\nto her chamber. I longed to see the ocean, which must be the only scene\\nof my escape, if ever it should happen. I pretended to be worse than I\\nreally was, and desired leave to take the fresh air of the sea, with a\\npage, whom I was very fond of, and who had sometimes been trusted with\\nme. I shall never forget with what unwillingness Glumdalclitch\\nconsented, nor the strict charge she gave the page to be careful of me,\\nbursting at the same time into a flood of tears, as if she had some\\nforboding of what was to happen. The boy took me out in my box, about\\nhalf an hour’s walk from the palace, towards the rocks on the\\nsea-shore. I ordered him to set me down, and lifting up one of my\\nsashes, cast many a wistful melancholy look towards the sea. I found\\nmyself not very well, and told the page that I had a mind to take a nap\\nin my hammock, which I hoped would do me good. I got in, and the boy\\nshut the window close down, to keep out the cold. I soon fell asleep,\\nand all I can conjecture is, while I slept, the page, thinking no\\ndanger could happen, went among the rocks to look for birds’ eggs,\\nhaving before observed him from my window searching about, and picking\\nup one or two in the clefts. Be that as it will, I found myself\\nsuddenly awaked with a violent pull upon the ring, which was fastened\\nat the top of my box for the conveniency of carriage. I felt my box\\nraised very high in the air, and then borne forward with prodigious\\nspeed. The first jolt had like to have shaken me out of my hammock, but\\nafterward the motion was easy enough. I called out several times, as\\nloud as I could raise my voice, but all to no purpose. I looked towards\\nmy windows, and could see nothing but the clouds and sky. I heard a\\nnoise just over my head, like the clapping of wings, and then began to\\nperceive the woful condition I was in; that some eagle had got the ring\\nof my box in his beak, with an intent to let it fall on a rock, like a\\ntortoise in a shell, and then pick out my body, and devour it: for the\\nsagacity and smell of this bird enables him to discover his quarry at a\\ngreat distance, though better concealed than I could be within a\\ntwo-inch board.\\n\\nIn a little time, I observed the noise and flutter of wings to increase\\nvery fast, and my box was tossed up and down, like a sign in a windy\\nday. I heard several bangs or buffets, as I thought given to the eagle\\n(for such I am certain it must have been that held the ring of my box\\nin his beak), and then, all on a sudden, felt myself falling\\nperpendicularly down, for above a minute, but with such incredible\\nswiftness, that I almost lost my breath. My fall was stopped by a\\nterrible squash, that sounded louder to my ears than the cataract of\\nNiagara; after which, I was quite in the dark for another minute, and\\nthen my box began to rise so high, that I could see light from the tops\\nof the windows. I now perceived I was fallen into the sea. My box, by\\nthe weight of my body, the goods that were in, and the broad plates of\\niron fixed for strength at the four corners of the top and bottom,\\nfloated about five feet deep in water. I did then, and do now suppose,\\nthat the eagle which flew away with my box was pursued by two or three\\nothers, and forced to let me drop, while he defended himself against\\nthe rest, who hoped to share in the prey. The plates of iron fastened\\nat the bottom of the box (for those were the strongest) preserved the\\nbalance while it fell, and hindered it from being broken on the surface\\nof the water. Every joint of it was well grooved; and the door did not\\nmove on hinges, but up and down like a sash, which kept my closet so\\ntight that very little water came in. I got with much difficulty out of\\nmy hammock, having first ventured to draw back the slip-board on the\\nroof already mentioned, contrived on purpose to let in air, for want of\\nwhich I found myself almost stifled.\\n\\nHow often did I then wish myself with my dear Glumdalclitch, from whom\\none single hour had so far divided me! And I may say with truth, that\\nin the midst of my own misfortunes I could not forbear lamenting my\\npoor nurse, the grief she would suffer for my loss, the displeasure of\\nthe queen, and the ruin of her fortune. Perhaps many travellers have\\nnot been under greater difficulties and distress than I was at this\\njuncture, expecting every moment to see my box dashed to pieces, or at\\nleast overset by the first violent blast, or rising wave. A breach in\\none single pane of glass would have been immediate death: nor could any\\nthing have preserved the windows, but the strong lattice wires placed\\non the outside, against accidents in travelling. I saw the water ooze\\nin at several crannies, although the leaks were not considerable, and I\\nendeavoured to stop them as well as I could. I was not able to lift up\\nthe roof of my closet, which otherwise I certainly should have done,\\nand sat on the top of it; where I might at least preserve myself some\\nhours longer, than by being shut up (as I may call it) in the hold. Or\\nif I escaped these dangers for a day or two, what could I expect but a\\nmiserable death of cold and hunger? I was four hours under these\\ncircumstances, expecting, and indeed wishing, every moment to be my\\nlast.\\n\\nI have already told the reader that there were two strong staples fixed\\nupon that side of my box which had no window, and into which the\\nservant, who used to carry me on horseback, would put a leathern belt,\\nand buckle it about his waist. Being in this disconsolate state, I\\nheard, or at least thought I heard, some kind of grating noise on that\\nside of my box where the staples were fixed; and soon after I began to\\nfancy that the box was pulled or towed along the sea; for I now and\\nthen felt a sort of tugging, which made the waves rise near the tops of\\nmy windows, leaving me almost in the dark. This gave me some faint\\nhopes of relief, although I was not able to imagine how it could be\\nbrought about. I ventured to unscrew one of my chairs, which were\\nalways fastened to the floor; and having made a hard shift to screw it\\ndown again, directly under the slipping-board that I had lately opened,\\nI mounted on the chair, and putting my mouth as near as I could to the\\nhole, I called for help in a loud voice, and in all the languages I\\nunderstood. I then fastened my handkerchief to a stick I usually\\ncarried, and thrusting it up the hole, waved it several times in the\\nair, that if any boat or ship were near, the seamen might conjecture\\nsome unhappy mortal to be shut up in the box.\\n\\nI found no effect from all I could do, but plainly perceived my closet\\nto be moved along; and in the space of an hour, or better, that side of\\nthe box where the staples were, and had no windows, struck against\\nsomething that was hard. I apprehended it to be a rock, and found\\nmyself tossed more than ever. I plainly heard a noise upon the cover of\\nmy closet, like that of a cable, and the grating of it as it passed\\nthrough the ring. I then found myself hoisted up, by degrees, at least\\nthree feet higher than I was before. Whereupon I again thrust up my\\nstick and handkerchief, calling for help till I was almost hoarse. In\\nreturn to which, I heard a great shout repeated three times, giving me\\nsuch transports of joy as are not to be conceived but by those who feel\\nthem. I now heard a trampling over my head, and somebody calling\\nthrough the hole with a loud voice, in the English tongue, “If there be\\nany body below, let them speak.” I answered, “I was an Englishman,\\ndrawn by ill fortune into the greatest calamity that ever any creature\\nunderwent, and begged, by all that was moving, to be delivered out of\\nthe dungeon I was in.” The voice replied, “I was safe, for my box was\\nfastened to their ship; and the carpenter should immediately come and\\nsaw a hole in the cover, large enough to pull me out.” I answered,\\n“that was needless, and would take up too much time; for there was no\\nmore to be done, but let one of the crew put his finger into the ring,\\nand take the box out of the sea into the ship, and so into the\\ncaptain’s cabin.” Some of them, upon hearing me talk so wildly, thought\\nI was mad: others laughed; for indeed it never came into my head, that\\nI was now got among people of my own stature and strength. The\\ncarpenter came, and in a few minutes sawed a passage about four feet\\nsquare, then let down a small ladder, upon which I mounted, and thence\\nwas taken into the ship in a very weak condition.\\n\\nThe sailors were all in amazement, and asked me a thousand questions,\\nwhich I had no inclination to answer. I was equally confounded at the\\nsight of so many pigmies, for such I took them to be, after having so\\nlong accustomed my eyes to the monstrous objects I had left. But the\\ncaptain, Mr. Thomas Wilcocks, an honest worthy Shropshire man,\\nobserving I was ready to faint, took me into his cabin, gave me a\\ncordial to comfort me, and made me turn in upon his own bed, advising\\nme to take a little rest, of which I had great need. Before I went to\\nsleep, I gave him to understand that I had some valuable furniture in\\nmy box, too good to be lost: a fine hammock, a handsome field-bed, two\\nchairs, a table, and a cabinet; that my closet was hung on all sides,\\nor rather quilted, with silk and cotton; that if he would let one of\\nthe crew bring my closet into his cabin, I would open it there before\\nhim, and show him my goods. The captain, hearing me utter these\\nabsurdities, concluded I was raving; however (I suppose to pacify me)\\nhe promised to give order as I desired, and going upon deck, sent some\\nof his men down into my closet, whence (as I afterwards found) they\\ndrew up all my goods, and stripped off the quilting; but the chairs,\\ncabinet, and bedstead, being screwed to the floor, were much damaged by\\nthe ignorance of the seamen, who tore them up by force. Then they\\nknocked off some of the boards for the use of the ship, and when they\\nhad got all they had a mind for, let the hull drop into the sea, which\\nby reason of many breaches made in the bottom and sides, sunk to\\nrights. And, indeed, I was glad not to have been a spectator of the\\nhavoc they made, because I am confident it would have sensibly touched\\nme, by bringing former passages into my mind, which I would rather have\\nforgot.\\n\\nI slept some hours, but perpetually disturbed with dreams of the place\\nI had left, and the dangers I had escaped. However, upon waking, I\\nfound myself much recovered. It was now about eight o’clock at night,\\nand the captain ordered supper immediately, thinking I had already\\nfasted too long. He entertained me with great kindness, observing me\\nnot to look wildly, or talk inconsistently: and, when we were left\\nalone, desired I would give him a relation of my travels, and by what\\naccident I came to be set adrift, in that monstrous wooden chest. He\\nsaid “that about twelve o’clock at noon, as he was looking through his\\nglass, he spied it at a distance, and thought it was a sail, which he\\nhad a mind to make, being not much out of his course, in hopes of\\nbuying some biscuit, his own beginning to fall short. That upon coming\\nnearer, and finding his error, he sent out his long-boat to discover\\nwhat it was; that his men came back in a fright, swearing they had seen\\na swimming house. That he laughed at their folly, and went himself in\\nthe boat, ordering his men to take a strong cable along with them. That\\nthe weather being calm, he rowed round me several times, observed my\\nwindows and wire lattices that defended them. That he discovered two\\nstaples upon one side, which was all of boards, without any passage for\\nlight. He then commanded his men to row up to that side, and fastening\\na cable to one of the staples, ordered them to tow my chest, as they\\ncalled it, toward the ship. When it was there, he gave directions to\\nfasten another cable to the ring fixed in the cover, and to raise up my\\nchest with pulleys, which all the sailors were not able to do above two\\nor three feet.” He said, “they saw my stick and handkerchief thrust out\\nof the hole, and concluded that some unhappy man must be shut up in the\\ncavity.” I asked, “whether he or the crew had seen any prodigious birds\\nin the air, about the time he first discovered me.” To which he\\nanswered, “that discoursing this matter with the sailors while I was\\nasleep, one of them said, he had observed three eagles flying towards\\nthe north, but remarked nothing of their being larger than the usual\\nsize:” which I suppose must be imputed to the great height they were\\nat; and he could not guess the reason of my question. I then asked the\\ncaptain, “how far he reckoned we might be from land?” He said, “by the\\nbest computation he could make, we were at least a hundred leagues.” I\\nassured him, “that he must be mistaken by almost half, for I had not\\nleft the country whence I came above two hours before I dropped into\\nthe sea.” Whereupon he began again to think that my brain was\\ndisturbed, of which he gave me a hint, and advised me to go to bed in a\\ncabin he had provided. I assured him, “I was well refreshed with his\\ngood entertainment and company, and as much in my senses as ever I was\\nin my life.” He then grew serious, and desired to ask me freely,\\n“whether I were not troubled in my mind by the consciousness of some\\nenormous crime, for which I was punished, at the command of some\\nprince, by exposing me in that chest; as great criminals, in other\\ncountries, have been forced to sea in a leaky vessel, without\\nprovisions: for although he should be sorry to have taken so ill a man\\ninto his ship, yet he would engage his word to set me safe ashore, in\\nthe first port where we arrived.” He added, “that his suspicions were\\nmuch increased by some very absurd speeches I had delivered at first to\\nhis sailors, and afterwards to himself, in relation to my closet or\\nchest, as well as by my odd looks and behaviour while I was at supper.”\\n\\nI begged his patience to hear me tell my story, which I faithfully did,\\nfrom the last time I left England, to the moment he first discovered\\nme. And, as truth always forces its way into rational minds, so this\\nhonest worthy gentleman, who had some tincture of learning, and very\\ngood sense, was immediately convinced of my candour and veracity. But\\nfurther to confirm all I had said, I entreated him to give order that\\nmy cabinet should be brought, of which I had the key in my pocket; for\\nhe had already informed me how the seamen disposed of my closet. I\\nopened it in his own presence, and showed him the small collection of\\nrarities I made in the country from which I had been so strangely\\ndelivered. There was the comb I had contrived out of the stumps of the\\nking’s beard, and another of the same materials, but fixed into a\\nparing of her majesty’s thumb-nail, which served for the back. There\\nwas a collection of needles and pins, from a foot to half a yard long;\\nfour wasp stings, like joiner’s tacks; some combings of the queen’s\\nhair; a gold ring, which one day she made me a present of, in a most\\nobliging manner, taking it from her little finger, and throwing it over\\nmy head like a collar. I desired the captain would please to accept\\nthis ring in return for his civilities; which he absolutely refused. I\\nshowed him a corn that I had cut off with my own hand, from a maid of\\nhonour’s toe; it was about the bigness of Kentish pippin, and grown so\\nhard, that when I returned to England, I got it hollowed into a cup,\\nand set in silver. Lastly, I desired him to see the breeches I had then\\non, which were made of a mouse’s skin.\\n\\nI could force nothing on him but a footman’s tooth, which I observed\\nhim to examine with great curiosity, and found he had a fancy for it.\\nHe received it with abundance of thanks, more than such a trifle could\\ndeserve. It was drawn by an unskilful surgeon, in a mistake, from one\\nof Glumdalclitch’s men, who was afflicted with the tooth-ache, but it\\nwas as sound as any in his head. I got it cleaned, and put it into my\\ncabinet. It was about a foot long, and four inches in diameter.\\n\\nThe captain was very well satisfied with this plain relation I had\\ngiven him, and said, “he hoped, when we returned to England, I would\\noblige the world by putting it on paper, and making it public.” My\\nanswer was, “that we were overstocked with books of travels: that\\nnothing could now pass which was not extraordinary; wherein I doubted\\nsome authors less consulted truth, than their own vanity, or interest,\\nor the diversion of ignorant readers; that my story could contain\\nlittle beside common events, without those ornamental descriptions of\\nstrange plants, trees, birds, and other animals; or of the barbarous\\ncustoms and idolatry of savage people, with which most writers abound.\\nHowever, I thanked him for his good opinion, and promised to take the\\nmatter into my thoughts.”\\n\\nHe said “he wondered at one thing very much, which was, to hear me\\nspeak so loud;” asking me “whether the king or queen of that country\\nwere thick of hearing?” I told him, “it was what I had been used to for\\nabove two years past, and that I admired as much at the voices of him\\nand his men, who seemed to me only to whisper, and yet I could hear\\nthem well enough. But, when I spoke in that country, it was like a man\\ntalking in the streets, to another looking out from the top of a\\nsteeple, unless when I was placed on a table, or held in any person’s\\nhand.” I told him, “I had likewise observed another thing, that, when I\\nfirst got into the ship, and the sailors stood all about me, I thought\\nthey were the most little contemptible creatures I had ever beheld.”\\nFor indeed, while I was in that prince’s country, I could never endure\\nto look in a glass, after my eyes had been accustomed to such\\nprodigious objects, because the comparison gave me so despicable a\\nconceit of myself. The captain said, “that while we were at supper, he\\nobserved me to look at every thing with a sort of wonder, and that I\\noften seemed hardly able to contain my laughter, which he knew not well\\nhow to take, but imputed it to some disorder in my brain.” I answered,\\n“it was very true; and I wondered how I could forbear, when I saw his\\ndishes of the size of a silver three-pence, a leg of pork hardly a\\nmouthful, a cup not so big as a nut-shell;” and so I went on,\\ndescribing the rest of his household-stuff and provisions, after the\\nsame manner. For, although the queen had ordered a little equipage of\\nall things necessary for me, while I was in her service, yet my ideas\\nwere wholly taken up with what I saw on every side of me, and I winked\\nat my own littleness, as people do at their own faults. The captain\\nunderstood my raillery very well, and merrily replied with the old\\nEnglish proverb, “that he doubted my eyes were bigger than my belly,\\nfor he did not observe my stomach so good, although I had fasted all\\nday;” and, continuing in his mirth, protested “he would have gladly\\ngiven a hundred pounds, to have seen my closet in the eagle’s bill, and\\nafterwards in its fall from so great a height into the sea; which would\\ncertainly have been a most astonishing object, worthy to have the\\ndescription of it transmitted to future ages:” and the comparison of\\nPhaeton was so obvious, that he could not forbear applying it, although\\nI did not much admire the conceit.\\n\\nThe captain having been at Tonquin, was, in his return to England,\\ndriven north-eastward to the latitude of 44 degrees, and longitude of\\n143. But meeting a trade-wind two days after I came on board him, we\\nsailed southward a long time, and coasting New Holland, kept our course\\nwest-south-west, and then south-south-west, till we doubled the Cape of\\nGood Hope. Our voyage was very prosperous, but I shall not trouble the\\nreader with a journal of it. The captain called in at one or two ports,\\nand sent in his long-boat for provisions and fresh water; but I never\\nwent out of the ship till we came into the Downs, which was on the\\nthird day of June, 1706, about nine months after my escape. I offered\\nto leave my goods in security for payment of my freight: but the\\ncaptain protested he would not receive one farthing. We took a kind\\nleave of each other, and I made him promise he would come to see me at\\nmy house in Redriff. I hired a horse and guide for five shillings,\\nwhich I borrowed of the captain.\\n\\nAs I was on the road, observing the littleness of the houses, the\\ntrees, the cattle, and the people, I began to think myself in Lilliput.\\nI was afraid of trampling on every traveller I met, and often called\\naloud to have them stand out of the way, so that I had like to have\\ngotten one or two broken heads for my impertinence.\\n\\nWhen I came to my own house, for which I was forced to inquire, one of\\nthe servants opening the door, I bent down to go in, (like a goose\\nunder a gate,) for fear of striking my head. My wife ran out to embrace\\nme, but I stooped lower than her knees, thinking she could otherwise\\nnever be able to reach my mouth. My daughter kneeled to ask my\\nblessing, but I could not see her till she arose, having been so long\\nused to stand with my head and eyes erect to above sixty feet; and then\\nI went to take her up with one hand by the waist. I looked down upon\\nthe servants, and one or two friends who were in the house, as if they\\nhad been pigmies and I a giant. I told my wife, “she had been too\\nthrifty, for I found she had starved herself and her daughter to\\nnothing.” In short, I behaved myself so unaccountably, that they were\\nall of the captain’s opinion when he first saw me, and concluded I had\\nlost my wits. This I mention as an instance of the great power of habit\\nand prejudice.\\n\\nIn a little time, I and my family and friends came to a right\\nunderstanding: but my wife protested “I should never go to sea any\\nmore;” although my evil destiny so ordered, that she had not power to\\nhinder me, as the reader may know hereafter. In the mean time, I here\\nconclude the second part of my unfortunate voyages.\\n\\n\\nPART III. A VOYAGE TO LAPUTA, BALNIBARBI, GLUBBDUBDRIB, LUGGNAGG AND\\nJAPAN.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\n\\nThe author sets out on his third voyage. Is taken by pirates. The\\nmalice of a Dutchman. His arrival at an island. He is received into\\nLaputa.\\n\\n\\nI had not been at home above ten days, when Captain William Robinson, a\\nCornish man, commander of the Hopewell, a stout ship of three hundred\\ntons, came to my house. I had formerly been surgeon of another ship\\nwhere he was master, and a fourth part owner, in a voyage to the\\nLevant. He had always treated me more like a brother, than an inferior\\nofficer; and, hearing of my arrival, made me a visit, as I apprehended\\nonly out of friendship, for nothing passed more than what is usual\\nafter long absences. But repeating his visits often, expressing his joy\\nto find me in good health, asking, “whether I were now settled for\\nlife?” adding, “that he intended a voyage to the East Indies in two\\nmonths,” at last he plainly invited me, though with some apologies, to\\nbe surgeon of the ship; “that I should have another surgeon under me,\\nbeside our two mates; that my salary should be double to the usual pay;\\nand that having experienced my knowledge in sea-affairs to be at least\\nequal to his, he would enter into any engagement to follow my advice,\\nas much as if I had shared in the command.”\\n\\nHe said so many other obliging things, and I knew him to be so honest a\\nman, that I could not reject this proposal; the thirst I had of seeing\\nthe world, notwithstanding my past misfortunes, continuing as violent\\nas ever. The only difficulty that remained, was to persuade my wife,\\nwhose consent however I at last obtained, by the prospect of advantage\\nshe proposed to her children.\\n\\nWe set out the 5th day of August, 1706, and arrived at Fort St. George\\nthe 11th of April, 1707. We staid there three weeks to refresh our\\ncrew, many of whom were sick. From thence we went to Tonquin, where the\\ncaptain resolved to continue some time, because many of the goods he\\nintended to buy were not ready, nor could he expect to be dispatched in\\nseveral months. Therefore, in hopes to defray some of the charges he\\nmust be at, he bought a sloop, loaded it with several sorts of goods,\\nwherewith the Tonquinese usually trade to the neighbouring islands, and\\nputting fourteen men on board, whereof three were of the country, he\\nappointed me master of the sloop, and gave me power to traffic, while\\nhe transacted his affairs at Tonquin.\\n\\nWe had not sailed above three days, when a great storm arising, we were\\ndriven five days to the north-north-east, and then to the east: after\\nwhich we had fair weather, but still with a pretty strong gale from the\\nwest. Upon the tenth day we were chased by two pirates, who soon\\novertook us; for my sloop was so deep laden, that she sailed very slow,\\nneither were we in a condition to defend ourselves.\\n\\nWe were boarded about the same time by both the pirates, who entered\\nfuriously at the head of their men; but finding us all prostrate upon\\nour faces (for so I gave order), they pinioned us with strong ropes,\\nand setting guard upon us, went to search the sloop.\\n\\nI observed among them a Dutchman, who seemed to be of some authority,\\nthough he was not commander of either ship. He knew us by our\\ncountenances to be Englishmen, and jabbering to us in his own language,\\nswore we should be tied back to back and thrown into the sea. I spoke\\nDutch tolerably well; I told him who we were, and begged him, in\\nconsideration of our being Christians and Protestants, of neighbouring\\ncountries in strict alliance, that he would move the captains to take\\nsome pity on us. This inflamed his rage; he repeated his threatenings,\\nand turning to his companions, spoke with great vehemence in the\\nJapanese language, as I suppose, often using the word _Christianos_.\\n\\nThe largest of the two pirate ships was commanded by a Japanese\\ncaptain, who spoke a little Dutch, but very imperfectly. He came up to\\nme, and after several questions, which I answered in great humility, he\\nsaid, “we should not die.” I made the captain a very low bow, and then,\\nturning to the Dutchman, said, “I was sorry to find more mercy in a\\nheathen, than in a brother christian.” But I had soon reason to repent\\nthose foolish words: for that malicious reprobate, having often\\nendeavoured in vain to persuade both the captains that I might be\\nthrown into the sea (which they would not yield to, after the promise\\nmade me that I should not die), however, prevailed so far, as to have a\\npunishment inflicted on me, worse, in all human appearance, than death\\nitself. My men were sent by an equal division into both the pirate\\nships, and my sloop new manned. As to myself, it was determined that I\\nshould be set adrift in a small canoe, with paddles and a sail, and\\nfour days’ provisions; which last, the Japanese captain was so kind to\\ndouble out of his own stores, and would permit no man to search me. I\\ngot down into the canoe, while the Dutchman, standing upon the deck,\\nloaded me with all the curses and injurious terms his language could\\nafford.\\n\\nAbout an hour before we saw the pirates I had taken an observation, and\\nfound we were in the latitude of 46 N. and longitude of 183. When I was\\nat some distance from the pirates, I discovered, by my pocket-glass,\\nseveral islands to the south-east. I set up my sail, the wind being\\nfair, with a design to reach the nearest of those islands, which I made\\na shift to do, in about three hours. It was all rocky: however I got\\nmany birds’ eggs; and, striking fire, I kindled some heath and dry\\nsea-weed, by which I roasted my eggs. I ate no other supper, being\\nresolved to spare my provisions as much as I could. I passed the night\\nunder the shelter of a rock, strewing some heath under me, and slept\\npretty well.\\n\\nThe next day I sailed to another island, and thence to a third and\\nfourth, sometimes using my sail, and sometimes my paddles. But, not to\\ntrouble the reader with a particular account of my distresses, let it\\nsuffice, that on the fifth day I arrived at the last island in my\\nsight, which lay south-south-east to the former.\\n\\nThis island was at a greater distance than I expected, and I did not\\nreach it in less than five hours. I encompassed it almost round, before\\nI could find a convenient place to land in; which was a small creek,\\nabout three times the wideness of my canoe. I found the island to be\\nall rocky, only a little intermingled with tufts of grass, and\\nsweet-smelling herbs. I took out my small provisions and after having\\nrefreshed myself, I secured the remainder in a cave, whereof there were\\ngreat numbers; I gathered plenty of eggs upon the rocks, and got a\\nquantity of dry sea-weed, and parched grass, which I designed to kindle\\nthe next day, and roast my eggs as well as I could, for I had about me\\nmy flint, steel, match, and burning-glass. I lay all night in the cave\\nwhere I had lodged my provisions. My bed was the same dry grass and\\nsea-weed which I intended for fuel. I slept very little, for the\\ndisquiets of my mind prevailed over my weariness, and kept me awake. I\\nconsidered how impossible it was to preserve my life in so desolate a\\nplace, and how miserable my end must be: yet found myself so listless\\nand desponding, that I had not the heart to rise; and before I could\\nget spirits enough to creep out of my cave, the day was far advanced. I\\nwalked awhile among the rocks: the sky was perfectly clear, and the sun\\nso hot, that I was forced to turn my face from it: when all on a sudden\\nit became obscure, as I thought, in a manner very different from what\\nhappens by the interposition of a cloud. I turned back, and perceived a\\nvast opaque body between me and the sun moving forwards towards the\\nisland: it seemed to be about two miles high, and hid the sun six or\\nseven minutes; but I did not observe the air to be much colder, or the\\nsky more darkened, than if I had stood under the shade of a mountain.\\nAs it approached nearer over the place where I was, it appeared to be a\\nfirm substance, the bottom flat, smooth, and shining very bright, from\\nthe reflection of the sea below. I stood upon a height about two\\nhundred yards from the shore, and saw this vast body descending almost\\nto a parallel with me, at less than an English mile distance. I took\\nout my pocket perspective, and could plainly discover numbers of people\\nmoving up and down the sides of it, which appeared to be sloping; but\\nwhat those people were doing I was not able to distinguish.\\n\\nThe natural love of life gave me some inward motion of joy, and I was\\nready to entertain a hope that this adventure might, some way or other,\\nhelp to deliver me from the desolate place and condition I was in. But\\nat the same time the reader can hardly conceive my astonishment, to\\nbehold an island in the air, inhabited by men, who were able (as it\\nshould seem) to raise or sink, or put it into progressive motion, as\\nthey pleased. But not being at that time in a disposition to\\nphilosophise upon this phenomenon, I rather chose to observe what\\ncourse the island would take, because it seemed for a while to stand\\nstill. Yet soon after, it advanced nearer, and I could see the sides of\\nit encompassed with several gradations of galleries, and stairs, at\\ncertain intervals, to descend from one to the other. In the lowest\\ngallery, I beheld some people fishing with long angling rods, and\\nothers looking on. I waved my cap (for my hat was long since worn out)\\nand my handkerchief toward the island; and upon its nearer approach, I\\ncalled and shouted with the utmost strength of my voice; and then\\nlooking circumspectly, I beheld a crowd gather to that side which was\\nmost in my view. I found by their pointing towards me and to each\\nother, that they plainly discovered me, although they made no return to\\nmy shouting. But I could see four or five men running in great haste,\\nup the stairs, to the top of the island, who then disappeared. I\\nhappened rightly to conjecture, that these were sent for orders to some\\nperson in authority upon this occasion.\\n\\nThe number of people increased, and, in less than half an hour, the\\nisland was moved and raised in such a manner, that the lowest gallery\\nappeared in a parallel of less than a hundred yards distance from the\\nheight where I stood. I then put myself in the most supplicating\\nposture, and spoke in the humblest accent, but received no answer.\\nThose who stood nearest over against me, seemed to be persons of\\ndistinction, as I supposed by their habit. They conferred earnestly\\nwith each other, looking often upon me. At length one of them called\\nout in a clear, polite, smooth dialect, not unlike in sound to the\\nItalian: and therefore I returned an answer in that language, hoping at\\nleast that the cadence might be more agreeable to his ears. Although\\nneither of us understood the other, yet my meaning was easily known,\\nfor the people saw the distress I was in.\\n\\nThey made signs for me to come down from the rock, and go towards the\\nshore, which I accordingly did; and the flying island being raised to a\\nconvenient height, the verge directly over me, a chain was let down\\nfrom the lowest gallery, with a seat fastened to the bottom, to which I\\nfixed myself, and was drawn up by pulleys.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\nThe humours and dispositions of the Laputians described. An account of\\ntheir learning. Of the king and his court. The author’s reception\\nthere. The inhabitants subject to fear and disquietudes. An account of\\nthe women.\\n\\n\\nAt my alighting, I was surrounded with a crowd of people, but those who\\nstood nearest seemed to be of better quality. They beheld me with all\\nthe marks and circumstances of wonder; neither indeed was I much in\\ntheir debt, having never till then seen a race of mortals so singular\\nin their shapes, habits, and countenances. Their heads were all\\nreclined, either to the right, or the left; one of their eyes turned\\ninward, and the other directly up to the zenith. Their outward garments\\nwere adorned with the figures of suns, moons, and stars; interwoven\\nwith those of fiddles, flutes, harps, trumpets, guitars, harpsichords,\\nand many other instruments of music, unknown to us in Europe. I\\nobserved, here and there, many in the habit of servants, with a blown\\nbladder, fastened like a flail to the end of a stick, which they\\ncarried in their hands. In each bladder was a small quantity of dried\\npeas, or little pebbles, as I was afterwards informed. With these\\nbladders, they now and then flapped the mouths and ears of those who\\nstood near them, of which practice I could not then conceive the\\nmeaning. It seems the minds of these people are so taken up with\\nintense speculations, that they neither can speak, nor attend to the\\ndiscourses of others, without being roused by some external taction\\nupon the organs of speech and hearing; for which reason, those persons\\nwho are able to afford it always keep a flapper (the original is\\n_climenole_) in their family, as one of their domestics; nor ever walk\\nabroad, or make visits, without him. And the business of this officer\\nis, when two, three, or more persons are in company, gently to strike\\nwith his bladder the mouth of him who is to speak, and the right ear of\\nhim or them to whom the speaker addresses himself. This flapper is\\nlikewise employed diligently to attend his master in his walks, and\\nupon occasion to give him a soft flap on his eyes; because he is always\\nso wrapped up in cogitation, that he is in manifest danger of falling\\ndown every precipice, and bouncing his head against every post; and in\\nthe streets, of justling others, or being justled himself into the\\nkennel.\\n\\nIt was necessary to give the reader this information, without which he\\nwould be at the same loss with me to understand the proceedings of\\nthese people, as they conducted me up the stairs to the top of the\\nisland, and from thence to the royal palace. While we were ascending,\\nthey forgot several times what they were about, and left me to myself,\\ntill their memories were again roused by their flappers; for they\\nappeared altogether unmoved by the sight of my foreign habit and\\ncountenance, and by the shouts of the vulgar, whose thoughts and minds\\nwere more disengaged.\\n\\nAt last we entered the palace, and proceeded into the chamber of\\npresence, where I saw the king seated on his throne, attended on each\\nside by persons of prime quality. Before the throne, was a large table\\nfilled with globes and spheres, and mathematical instruments of all\\nkinds. His majesty took not the least notice of us, although our\\nentrance was not without sufficient noise, by the concourse of all\\npersons belonging to the court. But he was then deep in a problem; and\\nwe attended at least an hour, before he could solve it. There stood by\\nhim, on each side, a young page with flaps in their hands, and when\\nthey saw he was at leisure, one of them gently struck his mouth, and\\nthe other his right ear; at which he startled like one awaked on the\\nsudden, and looking towards me and the company I was in, recollected\\nthe occasion of our coming, whereof he had been informed before. He\\nspoke some words, whereupon immediately a young man with a flap came up\\nto my side, and flapped me gently on the right ear; but I made signs,\\nas well as I could, that I had no occasion for such an instrument;\\nwhich, as I afterwards found, gave his majesty, and the whole court, a\\nvery mean opinion of my understanding. The king, as far as I could\\nconjecture, asked me several questions, and I addressed myself to him\\nin all the languages I had. When it was found I could neither\\nunderstand nor be understood, I was conducted by his order to an\\napartment in his palace (this prince being distinguished above all his\\npredecessors for his hospitality to strangers), where two servants were\\nappointed to attend me. My dinner was brought, and four persons of\\nquality, whom I remembered to have seen very near the king’s person,\\ndid me the honour to dine with me. We had two courses, of three dishes\\neach. In the first course, there was a shoulder of mutton cut into an\\nequilateral triangle, a piece of beef into a rhomboides, and a pudding\\ninto a cycloid. The second course was two ducks trussed up in the form\\nof fiddles; sausages and puddings resembling flutes and hautboys, and a\\nbreast of veal in the shape of a harp. The servants cut our bread into\\ncones, cylinders, parallelograms, and several other mathematical\\nfigures.\\n\\nWhile we were at dinner, I made bold to ask the names of several things\\nin their language, and those noble persons, by the assistance of their\\nflappers, delighted to give me answers, hoping to raise my admiration\\nof their great abilities if I could be brought to converse with them. I\\nwas soon able to call for bread and drink, or whatever else I wanted.\\n\\nAfter dinner my company withdrew, and a person was sent to me by the\\nking’s order, attended by a flapper. He brought with him pen, ink, and\\npaper, and three or four books, giving me to understand by signs, that\\nhe was sent to teach me the language. We sat together four hours, in\\nwhich time I wrote down a great number of words in columns, with the\\ntranslations over against them; I likewise made a shift to learn\\nseveral short sentences; for my tutor would order one of my servants to\\nfetch something, to turn about, to make a bow, to sit, or to stand, or\\nwalk, and the like. Then I took down the sentence in writing. He showed\\nme also, in one of his books, the figures of the sun, moon, and stars,\\nthe zodiac, the tropics, and polar circles, together with the\\ndenominations of many planes and solids. He gave me the names and\\ndescriptions of all the musical instruments, and the general terms of\\nart in playing on each of them. After he had left me, I placed all my\\nwords, with their interpretations, in alphabetical order. And thus, in\\na few days, by the help of a very faithful memory, I got some insight\\ninto their language. The word, which I interpret the flying or floating\\nisland, is in the original _Laputa_, whereof I could never learn the\\ntrue etymology. _Lap_, in the old obsolete language, signifies high;\\nand _untuh_, a governor; from which they say, by corruption, was\\nderived _Laputa_, from _Lapuntuh_. But I do not approve of this\\nderivation, which seems to be a little strained. I ventured to offer to\\nthe learned among them a conjecture of my own, that Laputa was _quasi\\nlap outed_; _lap_, signifying properly, the dancing of the sunbeams in\\nthe sea, and _outed_, a wing; which, however, I shall not obtrude, but\\nsubmit to the judicious reader.\\n\\nThose to whom the king had entrusted me, observing how ill I was clad,\\nordered a tailor to come next morning, and take measure for a suit of\\nclothes. This operator did his office after a different manner from\\nthose of his trade in Europe. He first took my altitude by a quadrant,\\nand then, with a rule and compasses, described the dimensions and\\noutlines of my whole body, all which he entered upon paper; and in six\\ndays brought my clothes very ill made, and quite out of shape, by\\nhappening to mistake a figure in the calculation. But my comfort was,\\nthat I observed such accidents very frequent, and little regarded.\\n\\nDuring my confinement for want of clothes, and by an indisposition that\\nheld me some days longer, I much enlarged my dictionary; and when I\\nwent next to court, was able to understand many things the king spoke,\\nand to return him some kind of answers. His majesty had given orders,\\nthat the island should move north-east and by east, to the vertical\\npoint over Lagado, the metropolis of the whole kingdom below, upon the\\nfirm earth. It was about ninety leagues distant, and our voyage lasted\\nfour days and a half. I was not in the least sensible of the\\nprogressive motion made in the air by the island. On the second\\nmorning, about eleven o’clock, the king himself in person, attended by\\nhis nobility, courtiers, and officers, having prepared all their\\nmusical instruments, played on them for three hours without\\nintermission, so that I was quite stunned with the noise; neither could\\nI possibly guess the meaning, till my tutor informed me. He said that,\\nthe people of their island had their ears adapted to hear “the music of\\nthe spheres, which always played at certain periods, and the court was\\nnow prepared to bear their part, in whatever instrument they most\\nexcelled.”\\n\\nIn our journey towards Lagado, the capital city, his majesty ordered\\nthat the island should stop over certain towns and villages, from\\nwhence he might receive the petitions of his subjects. And to this\\npurpose, several packthreads were let down, with small weights at the\\nbottom. On these packthreads the people strung their petitions, which\\nmounted up directly, like the scraps of paper fastened by schoolboys at\\nthe end of the string that holds their kite. Sometimes we received wine\\nand victuals from below, which were drawn up by pulleys.\\n\\nThe knowledge I had in mathematics gave me great assistance in\\nacquiring their phraseology, which depended much upon that science, and\\nmusic; and in the latter I was not unskilled. Their ideas are\\nperpetually conversant in lines and figures. If they would, for\\nexample, praise the beauty of a woman, or any other animal, they\\ndescribe it by rhombs, circles, parallelograms, ellipses, and other\\ngeometrical terms, or by words of art drawn from music, needless here\\nto repeat. I observed in the king’s kitchen all sorts of mathematical\\nand musical instruments, after the figures of which they cut up the\\njoints that were served to his majesty’s table.\\n\\nTheir houses are very ill built, the walls bevel, without one right\\nangle in any apartment; and this defect arises from the contempt they\\nbear to practical geometry, which they despise as vulgar and mechanic;\\nthose instructions they give being too refined for the intellects of\\ntheir workmen, which occasions perpetual mistakes. And although they\\nare dexterous enough upon a piece of paper, in the management of the\\nrule, the pencil, and the divider, yet in the common actions and\\nbehaviour of life, I have not seen a more clumsy, awkward, and unhandy\\npeople, nor so slow and perplexed in their conceptions upon all other\\nsubjects, except those of mathematics and music. They are very bad\\nreasoners, and vehemently given to opposition, unless when they happen\\nto be of the right opinion, which is seldom their case. Imagination,\\nfancy, and invention, they are wholly strangers to, nor have any words\\nin their language, by which those ideas can be expressed; the whole\\ncompass of their thoughts and mind being shut up within the two\\nforementioned sciences.\\n\\nMost of them, and especially those who deal in the astronomical part,\\nhave great faith in judicial astrology, although they are ashamed to\\nown it publicly. But what I chiefly admired, and thought altogether\\nunaccountable, was the strong disposition I observed in them towards\\nnews and politics, perpetually inquiring into public affairs, giving\\ntheir judgments in matters of state, and passionately disputing every\\ninch of a party opinion. I have indeed observed the same disposition\\namong most of the mathematicians I have known in Europe, although I\\ncould never discover the least analogy between the two sciences; unless\\nthose people suppose, that because the smallest circle has as many\\ndegrees as the largest, therefore the regulation and management of the\\nworld require no more abilities than the handling and turning of a\\nglobe; but I rather take this quality to spring from a very common\\ninfirmity of human nature, inclining us to be most curious and\\nconceited in matters where we have least concern, and for which we are\\nleast adapted by study or nature.\\n\\nThese people are under continual disquietudes, never enjoying a\\nminute’s peace of mind; and their disturbances proceed from causes\\nwhich very little affect the rest of mortals. Their apprehensions arise\\nfrom several changes they dread in the celestial bodies: for instance,\\nthat the earth, by the continual approaches of the sun towards it,\\nmust, in course of time, be absorbed, or swallowed up; that the face of\\nthe sun, will, by degrees, be encrusted with its own effluvia, and give\\nno more light to the world; that the earth very narrowly escaped a\\nbrush from the tail of the last comet, which would have infallibly\\nreduced it to ashes; and that the next, which they have calculated for\\none-and-thirty years hence, will probably destroy us. For if, in its\\nperihelion, it should approach within a certain degree of the sun (as\\nby their calculations they have reason to dread) it will receive a\\ndegree of heat ten thousand times more intense than that of red hot\\nglowing iron, and in its absence from the sun, carry a blazing tail ten\\nhundred thousand and fourteen miles long, through which, if the earth\\nshould pass at the distance of one hundred thousand miles from the\\nnucleus, or main body of the comet, it must in its passage be set on\\nfire, and reduced to ashes: that the sun, daily spending its rays\\nwithout any nutriment to supply them, will at last be wholly consumed\\nand annihilated; which must be attended with the destruction of this\\nearth, and of all the planets that receive their light from it.\\n\\nThey are so perpetually alarmed with the apprehensions of these, and\\nthe like impending dangers, that they can neither sleep quietly in\\ntheir beds, nor have any relish for the common pleasures and amusements\\nof life. When they meet an acquaintance in the morning, the first\\nquestion is about the sun’s health, how he looked at his setting and\\nrising, and what hopes they have to avoid the stroke of the approaching\\ncomet. This conversation they are apt to run into with the same temper\\nthat boys discover in delighting to hear terrible stories of spirits\\nand hobgoblins, which they greedily listen to, and dare not go to bed\\nfor fear.\\n\\nThe women of the island have abundance of vivacity: they contemn their\\nhusbands, and are exceedingly fond of strangers, whereof there is\\nalways a considerable number from the continent below, attending at\\ncourt, either upon affairs of the several towns and corporations, or\\ntheir own particular occasions, but are much despised, because they\\nwant the same endowments. Among these the ladies choose their gallants:\\nbut the vexation is, that they act with too much ease and security; for\\nthe husband is always so rapt in speculation, that the mistress and\\nlover may proceed to the greatest familiarities before his face, if he\\nbe but provided with paper and implements, and without his flapper at\\nhis side.\\n\\nThe wives and daughters lament their confinement to the island,\\nalthough I think it the most delicious spot of ground in the world; and\\nalthough they live here in the greatest plenty and magnificence, and\\nare allowed to do whatever they please, they long to see the world, and\\ntake the diversions of the metropolis, which they are not allowed to do\\nwithout a particular license from the king; and this is not easy to be\\nobtained, because the people of quality have found, by frequent\\nexperience, how hard it is to persuade their women to return from\\nbelow. I was told that a great court lady, who had several children,—is\\nmarried to the prime minister, the richest subject in the kingdom, a\\nvery graceful person, extremely fond of her, and lives in the finest\\npalace of the island,—went down to Lagado on the pretence of health,\\nthere hid herself for several months, till the king sent a warrant to\\nsearch for her; and she was found in an obscure eating-house all in\\nrags, having pawned her clothes to maintain an old deformed footman,\\nwho beat her every day, and in whose company she was taken, much\\nagainst her will. And although her husband received her with all\\npossible kindness, and without the least reproach, she soon after\\ncontrived to steal down again, with all her jewels, to the same\\ngallant, and has not been heard of since.\\n\\nThis may perhaps pass with the reader rather for an European or English\\nstory, than for one of a country so remote. But he may please to\\nconsider, that the caprices of womankind are not limited by any climate\\nor nation, and that they are much more uniform, than can be easily\\nimagined.\\n\\nIn about a month’s time, I had made a tolerable proficiency in their\\nlanguage, and was able to answer most of the king’s questions, when I\\nhad the honour to attend him. His majesty discovered not the least\\ncuriosity to inquire into the laws, government, history, religion, or\\nmanners of the countries where I had been; but confined his questions\\nto the state of mathematics, and received the account I gave him with\\ngreat contempt and indifference, though often roused by his flapper on\\neach side.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\nA phenomenon solved by modern philosophy and astronomy. The Laputians’\\ngreat improvements in the latter. The king’s method of suppressing\\ninsurrections.\\n\\n\\nI desired leave of this prince to see the curiosities of the island,\\nwhich he was graciously pleased to grant, and ordered my tutor to\\nattend me. I chiefly wanted to know, to what cause, in art or in\\nnature, it owed its several motions, whereof I will now give a\\nphilosophical account to the reader.\\n\\nThe flying or floating island is exactly circular, its diameter 7837\\nyards, or about four miles and a half, and consequently contains ten\\nthousand acres. It is three hundred yards thick. The bottom, or under\\nsurface, which appears to those who view it below, is one even regular\\nplate of adamant, shooting up to the height of about two hundred yards.\\nAbove it lie the several minerals in their usual order, and over all is\\na coat of rich mould, ten or twelve feet deep. The declivity of the\\nupper surface, from the circumference to the centre, is the natural\\ncause why all the dews and rains, which fall upon the island, are\\nconveyed in small rivulets toward the middle, where they are emptied\\ninto four large basins, each of about half a mile in circuit, and two\\nhundred yards distant from the centre. From these basins the water is\\ncontinually exhaled by the sun in the daytime, which effectually\\nprevents their overflowing. Besides, as it is in the power of the\\nmonarch to raise the island above the region of clouds and vapours, he\\ncan prevent the falling of dews and rain whenever he pleases. For the\\nhighest clouds cannot rise above two miles, as naturalists agree, at\\nleast they were never known to do so in that country.\\n\\nAt the centre of the island there is a chasm about fifty yards in\\ndiameter, whence the astronomers descend into a large dome, which is\\ntherefore called _flandona gagnole_, or the astronomer’s cave, situated\\nat the depth of a hundred yards beneath the upper surface of the\\nadamant. In this cave are twenty lamps continually burning, which, from\\nthe reflection of the adamant, cast a strong light into every part. The\\nplace is stored with great variety of sextants, quadrants, telescopes,\\nastrolabes, and other astronomical instruments. But the greatest\\ncuriosity, upon which the fate of the island depends, is a loadstone of\\na prodigious size, in shape resembling a weaver’s shuttle. It is in\\nlength six yards, and in the thickest part at least three yards over.\\nThis magnet is sustained by a very strong axle of adamant passing\\nthrough its middle, upon which it plays, and is poised so exactly that\\nthe weakest hand can turn it. It is hooped round with a hollow cylinder\\nof adamant, four feet deep, as many thick, and twelve yards in\\ndiameter, placed horizontally, and supported by eight adamantine feet,\\neach six yards high. In the middle of the concave side, there is a\\ngroove twelve inches deep, in which the extremities of the axle are\\nlodged, and turned round as there is occasion.\\n\\nThe stone cannot be removed from its place by any force, because the\\nhoop and its feet are one continued piece with that body of adamant\\nwhich constitutes the bottom of the island.\\n\\nBy means of this loadstone, the island is made to rise and fall, and\\nmove from one place to another. For, with respect to that part of the\\nearth over which the monarch presides, the stone is endued at one of\\nits sides with an attractive power, and at the other with a repulsive.\\nUpon placing the magnet erect, with its attracting end towards the\\nearth, the island descends; but when the repelling extremity points\\ndownwards, the island mounts directly upwards. When the position of the\\nstone is oblique, the motion of the island is so too. For in this\\nmagnet, the forces always act in lines parallel to its direction.\\n\\nBy this oblique motion, the island is conveyed to different parts of\\nthe monarch’s dominions. To explain the manner of its progress, let _A_\\n_B_ represent a line drawn across the dominions of Balnibarbi, let the\\nline _c_ _d_ represent the loadstone, of which let _d_ be the repelling\\nend, and _c_ the attracting end, the island being over _C_; let the\\nstone be placed in the position _c_ _d_, with its repelling end\\ndownwards; then the island will be driven upwards obliquely towards\\n_D_. When it is arrived at _D_, let the stone be turned upon its axle,\\ntill its attracting end points towards _E_, and then the island will be\\ncarried obliquely towards _E_; where, if the stone be again turned upon\\nits axle till it stands in the position _E_ _F_, with its repelling\\npoint downwards, the island will rise obliquely towards _F_, where, by\\ndirecting the attracting end towards _G_, the island may be carried to\\n_G_, and from _G_ to _H_, by turning the stone, so as to make its\\nrepelling extremity to point directly downward. And thus, by changing\\nthe situation of the stone, as often as there is occasion, the island\\nis made to rise and fall by turns in an oblique direction, and by those\\nalternate risings and fallings (the obliquity being not considerable)\\nis conveyed from one part of the dominions to the other.\\n\\nBut it must be observed, that this island cannot move beyond the extent\\nof the dominions below, nor can it rise above the height of four miles.\\nFor which the astronomers (who have written large systems concerning\\nthe stone) assign the following reason: that the magnetic virtue does\\nnot extend beyond the distance of four miles, and that the mineral,\\nwhich acts upon the stone in the bowels of the earth, and in the sea\\nabout six leagues distant from the shore, is not diffused through the\\nwhole globe, but terminated with the limits of the king’s dominions;\\nand it was easy, from the great advantage of such a superior situation,\\nfor a prince to bring under his obedience whatever country lay within\\nthe attraction of that magnet.\\n\\nWhen the stone is put parallel to the plane of the horizon, the island\\nstands still; for in that case the extremities of it, being at equal\\ndistance from the earth, act with equal force, the one in drawing\\ndownwards, the other in pushing upwards, and consequently no motion can\\nensue.\\n\\nThis loadstone is under the care of certain astronomers, who, from time\\nto time, give it such positions as the monarch directs. They spend the\\ngreatest part of their lives in observing the celestial bodies, which\\nthey do by the assistance of glasses, far excelling ours in goodness.\\nFor, although their largest telescopes do not exceed three feet, they\\nmagnify much more than those of a hundred with us, and show the stars\\nwith greater clearness. This advantage has enabled them to extend their\\ndiscoveries much further than our astronomers in Europe; for they have\\nmade a catalogue of ten thousand fixed stars, whereas the largest of\\nours do not contain above one third part of that number. They have\\nlikewise discovered two lesser stars, or satellites, which revolve\\nabout Mars; whereof the innermost is distant from the centre of the\\nprimary planet exactly three of his diameters, and the outermost, five;\\nthe former revolves in the space of ten hours, and the latter in\\ntwenty-one and a half; so that the squares of their periodical times\\nare very near in the same proportion with the cubes of their distance\\nfrom the centre of Mars; which evidently shows them to be governed by\\nthe same law of gravitation that influences the other heavenly bodies.\\n\\nThey have observed ninety-three different comets, and settled their\\nperiods with great exactness. If this be true (and they affirm it with\\ngreat confidence) it is much to be wished, that their observations were\\nmade public, whereby the theory of comets, which at present is very\\nlame and defective, might be brought to the same perfection with other\\narts of astronomy.\\n\\nThe king would be the most absolute prince in the universe, if he could\\nbut prevail on a ministry to join with him; but these having their\\nestates below on the continent, and considering that the office of a\\nfavourite has a very uncertain tenure, would never consent to the\\nenslaving of their country.\\n\\nIf any town should engage in rebellion or mutiny, fall into violent\\nfactions, or refuse to pay the usual tribute, the king has two methods\\nof reducing them to obedience. The first and the mildest course is, by\\nkeeping the island hovering over such a town, and the lands about it,\\nwhereby he can deprive them of the benefit of the sun and the rain, and\\nconsequently afflict the inhabitants with dearth and diseases. And if\\nthe crime deserve it, they are at the same time pelted from above with\\ngreat stones, against which they have no defence but by creeping into\\ncellars or caves, while the roofs of their houses are beaten to pieces.\\nBut if they still continue obstinate, or offer to raise insurrections,\\nhe proceeds to the last remedy, by letting the island drop directly\\nupon their heads, which makes a universal destruction both of houses\\nand men. However, this is an extremity to which the prince is seldom\\ndriven, neither indeed is he willing to put it in execution; nor dare\\nhis ministers advise him to an action, which, as it would render them\\nodious to the people, so it would be a great damage to their own\\nestates, which all lie below; for the island is the king’s demesne.\\n\\nBut there is still indeed a more weighty reason, why the kings of this\\ncountry have been always averse from executing so terrible an action,\\nunless upon the utmost necessity. For, if the town intended to be\\ndestroyed should have in it any tall rocks, as it generally falls out\\nin the larger cities, a situation probably chosen at first with a view\\nto prevent such a catastrophe; or if it abound in high spires, or\\npillars of stone, a sudden fall might endanger the bottom or under\\nsurface of the island, which, although it consist, as I have said, of\\none entire adamant, two hundred yards thick, might happen to crack by\\ntoo great a shock, or burst by approaching too near the fires from the\\nhouses below, as the backs, both of iron and stone, will often do in\\nour chimneys. Of all this the people are well apprised, and understand\\nhow far to carry their obstinacy, where their liberty or property is\\nconcerned. And the king, when he is highest provoked, and most\\ndetermined to press a city to rubbish, orders the island to descend\\nwith great gentleness, out of a pretence of tenderness to his people,\\nbut, indeed, for fear of breaking the adamantine bottom; in which case,\\nit is the opinion of all their philosophers, that the loadstone could\\nno longer hold it up, and the whole mass would fall to the ground.\\n\\nAbout three years before my arrival among them, while the king was in\\nhis progress over his dominions, there happened an extraordinary\\naccident which had like to have put a period to the fate of that\\nmonarchy, at least as it is now instituted. Lindalino, the second city\\nin the kingdom, was the first his majesty visited in his progress.\\nThree days after his departure the inhabitants, who had often\\ncomplained of great oppressions, shut the town gates, seized on the\\ngovernor, and with incredible speed and labour erected four large\\ntowers, one at every corner of the city (which is an exact square),\\nequal in height to a strong pointed rock that stands directly in the\\ncentre of the city. Upon the top of each tower, as well as upon the\\nrock, they fixed a great loadstone, and in case their design should\\nfail, they had provided a vast quantity of the most combustible fuel,\\nhoping to burst therewith the adamantine bottom of the island, if the\\nloadstone project should miscarry.\\n\\nIt was eight months before the king had perfect notice that the\\nLindalinians were in rebellion. He then commanded that the island\\nshould be wafted over the city. The people were unanimous, and had laid\\nin store of provisions, and a great river runs through the middle of\\nthe town. The king hovered over them several days to deprive them of\\nthe sun and the rain. He ordered many packthreads to be let down, yet\\nnot a person offered to send up a petition, but instead thereof very\\nbold demands, the redress of all their grievances, great immunities,\\nthe choice of their own governor, and other the like exorbitances. Upon\\nwhich his majesty commanded all the inhabitants of the island to cast\\ngreat stones from the lower gallery into the town; but the citizens had\\nprovided against this mischief by conveying their persons and effects\\ninto the four towers, and other strong buildings, and vaults\\nunderground.\\n\\nThe king being now determined to reduce this proud people, ordered that\\nthe island should descend gently within forty yards of the top of the\\ntowers and rock. This was accordingly done; but the officers employed\\nin that work found the descent much speedier than usual, and by turning\\nthe loadstone could not without great difficulty keep it in a firm\\nposition, but found the island inclining to fall. They sent the king\\nimmediate intelligence of this astonishing event, and begged his\\nmajesty’s permission to raise the island higher; the king consented, a\\ngeneral council was called, and the officers of the loadstone ordered\\nto attend. One of the oldest and expertest among them obtained leave to\\ntry an experiment, he took a strong line of an hundred yards, and the\\nisland being raised over the town above the attracting power they had\\nfelt, he fastened a piece of adamant to the end of his line, which had\\nin it a mixture of iron mineral, of the same nature with that whereof\\nthe bottom or lower surface of the island is composed, and from the\\nlower gallery let it down slowly towards the top of the towers. The\\nadamant was not descended four yards, before the officer felt it drawn\\nso strongly downwards that he could hardly pull it back, he then threw\\ndown several small pieces of adamant, and observed that they were all\\nviolently attracted by the top of the tower. The same experiment was\\nmade on the other three towers, and on the rock with the same effect.\\n\\nThis incident broke entirely the king’s measures, and (to dwell no\\nlonger on other circumstances) he was forced to give the town their own\\nconditions.\\n\\nI was assured by a great minister that if the island had descended so\\nnear the town as not to be able to raise itself, the citizens were\\ndetermined to fix it for ever, to kill the king and all his servants,\\nand entirely change the government.\\n\\nBy a fundamental law of this realm, neither the king, nor either of his\\ntwo eldest sons, are permitted to leave the island; nor the queen, till\\nshe is past child-bearing.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\nThe author leaves Laputa; is conveyed to Balnibarbi; arrives at the\\nmetropolis.

His conversation with\\nthat lord.\\n\\n\\nAlthough I cannot say that I was ill treated in this island, yet I must\\nconfess I thought myself too much neglected, not without some degree of\\ncontempt; for neither prince nor people appeared to be curious in any\\npart of knowledge, except mathematics and music, wherein I was far\\ntheir inferior, and upon that account very little regarded.\\n\\nOn the other side, after having seen all the curiosities of the island,\\nI was very desirous to leave it, being heartily weary of those people.\\nThey were indeed excellent in two sciences for which I have great\\nesteem, and wherein I am not unversed; but, at the same time, so\\nabstracted and involved in speculation, that I never met with such\\ndisagreeable companions. I conversed only with women, tradesmen,\\nflappers, and court-pages, during two months of my abode there; by\\nwhich, at last, I rendered myself extremely contemptible; yet these\\nwere the only people from whom I could ever receive a reasonable\\nanswer.\\n\\nI had obtained, by hard study, a good degree of knowledge in their\\nlanguage; I was weary of being confined to an island where I received\\nso little countenance, and resolved to leave it with the first\\nopportunity.\\n\\nThere was a great lord at court, nearly related to the king, and for\\nthat reason alone used with respect. He was universally reckoned the\\nmost ignorant and stupid person among them. He had performed many\\neminent services for the crown, had great natural and acquired parts,\\nadorned with integrity and honour; but so ill an ear for music, that\\nhis detractors reported, “he had been often known to beat time in the\\nwrong place;” neither could his tutors, without extreme difficulty,\\nteach him to demonstrate the most easy proposition in the mathematics.\\nHe was pleased to show me many marks of favour, often did me the honour\\nof a visit, desired to be informed in the affairs of Europe, the laws\\nand customs, the manners and learning of the several countries where I\\nhad travelled. He listened to me with great attention, and made very\\nwise observations on all I spoke. He had two flappers attending him for\\nstate, but never made use of them, except at court and in visits of\\nceremony, and would always command them to withdraw, when we were alone\\ntogether.\\n\\nI entreated this illustrious person, to intercede in my behalf with his\\nmajesty, for leave to depart; which he accordingly did, as he was\\npleased to tell me, with regret: for indeed he had made me several\\noffers very advantageous, which, however, I refused, with expressions\\nof the highest acknowledgment.\\n\\nOn the 16th day of February I took leave of his majesty and the court.\\nThe king made me a present to the value of about two hundred pounds\\nEnglish, and my protector, his kinsman, as much more, together with a\\nletter of recommendation to a friend of his in Lagado, the metropolis.\\nThe island being then hovering over a mountain about two miles from it,\\nI was let down from the lowest gallery, in the same manner as I had\\nbeen taken up.\\n\\nThe continent, as far as it is subject to the monarch of the flying\\nisland, passes under the general name of _Balnibarbi_; and the\\nmetropolis, as I said before, is called _Lagado_. I felt some little\\nsatisfaction in finding myself on firm ground. I walked to the city\\nwithout any concern, being clad like one of the natives, and\\nsufficiently instructed to converse with them. I soon found out the\\nperson’s house to whom I was recommended, presented my letter from his\\nfriend the grandee in the island, and was received with much kindness.\\nThis great lord, whose name was Munodi, ordered me an apartment in his\\nown house, where I continued during my stay, and was entertained in a\\nmost hospitable manner.\\n\\nThe next morning after my arrival, he took me in his chariot to see the\\ntown, which is about half the bigness of London; but the houses very\\nstrangely built, and most of them out of repair. The people in the\\nstreets walked fast, looked wild, their eyes fixed, and were generally\\nin rags. We passed through one of the town gates, and went about three\\nmiles into the country, where I saw many labourers working with several\\nsorts of tools in the ground, but was not able to conjecture what they\\nwere about; neither did I observe any expectation either of corn or\\ngrass, although the soil appeared to be excellent. I could not forbear\\nadmiring at these odd appearances, both in town and country; and I made\\nbold to desire my conductor, that he would be pleased to explain to me,\\nwhat could be meant by so many busy heads, hands, and faces, both in\\nthe streets and the fields, because I did not discover any good effects\\nthey produced; but, on the contrary, I never knew a soil so unhappily\\ncultivated, houses so ill contrived and so ruinous, or a people whose\\ncountenances and habit expressed so much misery and want.\\n\\nThis lord Munodi was a person of the first rank, and had been some\\nyears governor of Lagado; but, by a cabal of ministers, was discharged\\nfor insufficiency. However, the king treated him with tenderness, as a\\nwell-meaning man, but of a low contemptible understanding.\\n\\nWhen I gave that free censure of the country and its inhabitants, he\\nmade no further answer than by telling me, “that I had not been long\\nenough among them to form a judgment; and that the different nations of\\nthe world had different customs;” with other common topics to the same\\npurpose. But, when we returned to his palace, he asked me “how I liked\\nthe building, what absurdities I observed, and what quarrel I had with\\nthe dress or looks of his domestics?” This he might safely do; because\\nevery thing about him was magnificent, regular, and polite. I answered,\\n“that his excellency’s prudence, quality, and fortune, had exempted him\\nfrom those defects, which folly and beggary had produced in others.” He\\nsaid, “if I would go with him to his country-house, about twenty miles\\ndistant, where his estate lay, there would be more leisure for this\\nkind of conversation.” I told his excellency “that I was entirely at\\nhis disposal;” and accordingly we set out next morning.\\n\\nDuring our journey he made me observe the several methods used by\\nfarmers in managing their lands, which to me were wholly unaccountable;\\nfor, except in some very few places, I could not discover one ear of\\ncorn or blade of grass. But, in three hours travelling, the scene was\\nwholly altered; we came into a most beautiful country; farmers’ houses,\\nat small distances, neatly built; the fields enclosed, containing\\nvineyards, corn-grounds, and meadows. Neither do I remember to have\\nseen a more delightful prospect. His excellency observed my countenance\\nto clear up; he told me, with a sigh, “that there his estate began, and\\nwould continue the same, till we should come to his house: that his\\ncountrymen ridiculed and despised him, for managing his affairs no\\nbetter, and for setting so ill an example to the kingdom; which,\\nhowever, was followed by very few, such as were old, and wilful, and\\nweak like himself.”\\n\\nWe came at length to the house, which was indeed a noble structure,\\nbuilt according to the best rules of ancient architecture. The\\nfountains, gardens, walks, avenues, and groves, were all disposed with\\nexact judgment and taste. I gave due praises to every thing I saw,\\nwhereof his excellency took not the least notice till after supper;\\nwhen, there being no third companion, he told me with a very melancholy\\nair “that he doubted he must throw down his houses in town and country,\\nto rebuild them after the present mode; destroy all his plantations,\\nand cast others into such a form as modern usage required, and give the\\nsame directions to all his tenants, unless he would submit to incur the\\ncensure of pride, singularity, affectation, ignorance, caprice, and\\nperhaps increase his majesty’s displeasure; that the admiration I\\nappeared to be under would cease or diminish, when he had informed me\\nof some particulars which, probably, I never heard of at court, the\\npeople there being too much taken up in their own speculations, to have\\nregard to what passed here below.”\\n\\nThe sum of his discourse was to this effect: “That about forty years\\nago, certain persons went up to Laputa, either upon business or\\ndiversion, and, after five months continuance, came back with a very\\nlittle smattering in mathematics, but full of volatile spirits acquired\\nin that airy region: that these persons, upon their return, began to\\ndislike the management of every thing below, and fell into schemes of\\nputting all arts, sciences, languages, and mechanics, upon a new foot.\\nTo this end, they procured a royal patent for erecting an academy of\\nprojectors in Lagado; and the humour prevailed so strongly among the\\npeople, that there is not a town of any consequence in the kingdom\\nwithout such an academy. In these colleges the professors contrive new\\nrules and methods of agriculture and building, and new instruments, and\\ntools for all trades and manufactures; whereby, as they undertake, one\\nman shall do the work of ten; a palace may be built in a week, of\\nmaterials so durable as to last for ever without repairing. All the\\nfruits of the earth shall come to maturity at whatever season we think\\nfit to choose, and increase a hundred fold more than they do at\\npresent; with innumerable other happy proposals. The only inconvenience\\nis, that none of these projects are yet brought to perfection; and in\\nthe mean time, the whole country lies miserably waste, the houses in\\nruins, and the people without food or clothes. By all which, instead of\\nbeing discouraged, they are fifty times more violently bent upon\\nprosecuting their schemes, driven equally on by hope and despair: that\\nas for himself, being not of an enterprising spirit, he was content to\\ngo on in the old forms, to live in the houses his ancestors had built,\\nand act as they did, in every part of life, without innovation: that\\nsome few other persons of quality and gentry had done the same, but\\nwere looked on with an eye of contempt and ill-will, as enemies to art,\\nignorant, and ill common-wealth’s men, preferring their own ease and\\nsloth before the general improvement of their country.”\\n\\nHis lordship added, “That he would not, by any further particulars,\\nprevent the pleasure I should certainly take in viewing the grand\\nacademy, whither he was resolved I should go.” He only desired me to\\nobserve a ruined building, upon the side of a mountain about three\\nmiles distant, of which he gave me this account: “That he had a very\\nconvenient mill within half a mile of his house, turned by a current\\nfrom a large river, and sufficient for his own family, as well as a\\ngreat number of his tenants; that about seven years ago, a club of\\nthose projectors came to him with proposals to destroy this mill, and\\nbuild another on the side of that mountain, on the long ridge whereof a\\nlong canal must be cut, for a repository of water, to be conveyed up by\\npipes and engines to supply the mill, because the wind and air upon a\\nheight agitated the water, and thereby made it fitter for motion, and\\nbecause the water, descending down a declivity, would turn the mill\\nwith half the current of a river whose course is more upon a level.” He\\nsaid, “that being then not very well with the court, and pressed by\\nmany of his friends, he complied with the proposal; and after employing\\na hundred men for two years, the work miscarried, the projectors went\\noff, laying the blame entirely upon him, railing at him ever since, and\\nputting others upon the same experiment, with equal assurance of\\nsuccess, as well as equal disappointment.”\\n\\nIn a few days we came back to town; and his excellency, considering the\\nbad character he had in the academy, would not go with me himself, but\\nrecommended me to a friend of his, to bear me company thither. My lord\\nwas pleased to represent me as a great admirer of projects, and a\\nperson of much curiosity and easy belief; which, indeed, was not\\nwithout truth; for I had myself been a sort of projector in my younger\\ndays.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\nThe author permitted to see the grand academy of Lagado. The academy\\nlargely described. The arts wherein the professors employ themselves.\\n\\n\\nThis academy is not an entire single building, but a continuation of\\nseveral houses on both sides of a street, which growing waste, was\\npurchased and applied to that use.\\n\\nI was received very kindly by the warden, and went for many days to the\\nacademy. Every room has in it one or more projectors; and I believe I\\ncould not be in fewer than five hundred rooms.\\n\\nThe first man I saw was of a meagre aspect, with sooty hands and face,\\nhis hair and beard long, ragged, and singed in several places. His\\nclothes, shirt, and skin, were all of the same colour. He had been\\neight years upon a project for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers,\\nwhich were to be put in phials hermetically sealed, and let out to warm\\nthe air in raw inclement summers. He told me, he did not doubt, that,\\nin eight years more, he should be able to supply the governor’s gardens\\nwith sunshine, at a reasonable rate; but he complained that his stock\\nwas low, and entreated me “to give him something as an encouragement to\\ningenuity, especially since this had been a very dear season for\\ncucumbers.” I made him a small present, for my lord had furnished me\\nwith money on purpose, because he knew their practice of begging from\\nall who go to see them.\\n\\nI went into another chamber, but was ready to hasten back, being almost\\novercome with a horrible stink. My conductor pressed me forward,\\nconjuring me in a whisper “to give no offence, which would be highly\\nresented;” and therefore I durst not so much as stop my nose. The\\nprojector of this cell was the most ancient student of the academy; his\\nface and beard were of a pale yellow; his hands and clothes daubed over\\nwith filth. When I was presented to him, he gave me a close embrace, a\\ncompliment I could well have excused. His employment, from his first\\ncoming into the academy, was an operation to reduce human excrement to\\nits original food, by separating the several parts, removing the\\ntincture which it receives from the gall, making the odour exhale, and\\nscumming off the saliva. He had a weekly allowance, from the society,\\nof a vessel filled with human ordure, about the bigness of a Bristol\\nbarrel.\\n\\nI saw another at work to calcine ice into gunpowder; who likewise\\nshowed me a treatise he had written concerning the malleability of\\nfire, which he intended to publish.\\n\\nThere was a most ingenious architect, who had contrived a new method\\nfor building houses, by beginning at the roof, and working downward to\\nthe foundation; which he justified to me, by the like practice of those\\ntwo prudent insects, the bee and the spider.\\n\\nThere was a man born blind, who had several apprentices in his own\\ncondition: their employment was to mix colours for painters, which\\ntheir master taught them to distinguish by feeling and smelling. It was\\nindeed my misfortune to find them at that time not very perfect in\\ntheir lessons, and the professor himself happened to be generally\\nmistaken. This artist is much encouraged and esteemed by the whole\\nfraternity.\\n\\nIn another apartment I was highly pleased with a projector who had\\nfound a device of ploughing the ground with hogs, to save the charges\\nof ploughs, cattle, and labour. The method is this: in an acre of\\nground you bury, at six inches distance and eight deep, a quantity of\\nacorns, dates, chestnuts, and other mast or vegetables, whereof these\\nanimals are fondest; then you drive six hundred or more of them into\\nthe field, where, in a few days, they will root up the whole ground in\\nsearch of their food, and make it fit for sowing, at the same time\\nmanuring it with their dung: it is true, upon experiment, they found\\nthe charge and trouble very great, and they had little or no crop.\\nHowever it is not doubted, that this invention may be capable of great\\nimprovement.\\n\\nI went into another room, where the walls and ceiling were all hung\\nround with cobwebs, except a narrow passage for the artist to go in and\\nout. At my entrance, he called aloud to me, “not to disturb his webs.”\\nHe lamented “the fatal mistake the world had been so long in, of using\\nsilkworms, while we had such plenty of domestic insects who infinitely\\nexcelled the former, because they understood how to weave, as well as\\nspin.” And he proposed further, “that by employing spiders, the charge\\nof dyeing silks should be wholly saved;” whereof I was fully convinced,\\nwhen he showed me a vast number of flies most beautifully coloured,\\nwherewith he fed his spiders, assuring us “that the webs would take a\\ntincture from them; and as he had them of all hues, he hoped to fit\\neverybody’s fancy, as soon as he could find proper food for the flies,\\nof certain gums, oils, and other glutinous matter, to give a strength\\nand consistence to the threads.”\\n\\nThere was an astronomer, who had undertaken to place a sun-dial upon\\nthe great weathercock on the town-house, by adjusting the annual and\\ndiurnal motions of the earth and sun, so as to answer and coincide with\\nall accidental turnings of the wind.\\n\\nI was complaining of a small fit of the colic, upon which my conductor\\nled me into a room where a great physician resided, who was famous for\\ncuring that disease, by contrary operations from the same instrument.\\nHe had a large pair of bellows, with a long slender muzzle of ivory.\\nThis he conveyed eight inches up the anus, and drawing in the wind, he\\naffirmed he could make the guts as lank as a dried bladder. But when\\nthe disease was more stubborn and violent, he let in the muzzle while\\nthe bellows were full of wind, which he discharged into the body of the\\npatient; then withdrew the instrument to replenish it, clapping his\\nthumb strongly against the orifice of the fundament; and this being\\nrepeated three or four times, the adventitious wind would rush out,\\nbringing the noxious along with it, (like water put into a pump), and\\nthe patient recovered. I saw him try both experiments upon a dog, but\\ncould not discern any effect from the former. After the latter the\\nanimal was ready to burst, and made so violent a discharge as was very\\noffensive to me and my companions. The dog died on the spot, and we\\nleft the doctor endeavouring to recover him, by the same operation.\\n\\nI visited many other apartments, but shall not trouble my reader with\\nall the curiosities I observed, being studious of brevity.\\n\\nI had hitherto seen only one side of the academy, the other being\\nappropriated to the advancers of speculative learning, of whom I shall\\nsay something, when I have mentioned one illustrious person more, who\\nis called among them “the universal artist.” He told us “he had been\\nthirty years employing his thoughts for the improvement of human life.”\\nHe had two large rooms full of wonderful curiosities, and fifty men at\\nwork. Some were condensing air into a dry tangible substance, by\\nextracting the nitre, and letting the aqueous or fluid particles\\npercolate; others softening marble, for pillows and pin-cushions;\\nothers petrifying the hoofs of a living horse, to preserve them from\\nfoundering. The artist himself was at that time busy upon two great\\ndesigns; the first, to sow land with chaff, wherein he affirmed the\\ntrue seminal virtue to be contained, as he demonstrated by several\\nexperiments, which I was not skilful enough to comprehend. The other\\nwas, by a certain composition of gums, minerals, and vegetables,\\noutwardly applied, to prevent the growth of wool upon two young lambs;\\nand he hoped, in a reasonable time to propagate the breed of naked\\nsheep, all over the kingdom.\\n\\nWe crossed a walk to the other part of the academy, where, as I have\\nalready said, the projectors in speculative learning resided.\\n\\nThe first professor I saw, was in a very large room, with forty pupils\\nabout him. After salutation, observing me to look earnestly upon a\\nframe, which took up the greatest part of both the length and breadth\\nof the room, he said, “Perhaps I might wonder to see him employed in a\\nproject for improving speculative knowledge, by practical and\\nmechanical operations. But the world would soon be sensible of its\\nusefulness; and he flattered himself, that a more noble, exalted\\nthought never sprang in any other man’s head. Every one knew how\\nlaborious the usual method is of attaining to arts and sciences;\\nwhereas, by his contrivance, the most ignorant person, at a reasonable\\ncharge, and with a little bodily labour, might write books in\\nphilosophy, poetry, politics, laws, mathematics, and theology, without\\nthe least assistance from genius or study.” He then led me to the\\nframe, about the sides, whereof all his pupils stood in ranks. It was\\ntwenty feet square, placed in the middle of the room. The superficies\\nwas composed of several bits of wood, about the bigness of a die, but\\nsome larger than others. They were all linked together by slender\\nwires. These bits of wood were covered, on every square, with paper\\npasted on them; and on these papers were written all the words of their\\nlanguage, in their several moods, tenses, and declensions; but without\\nany order. The professor then desired me “to observe; for he was going\\nto set his engine at work.” The pupils, at his command, took each of\\nthem hold of an iron handle, whereof there were forty fixed round the\\nedges of the frame; and giving them a sudden turn, the whole\\ndisposition of the words was entirely changed. He then commanded\\nsix-and-thirty of the lads, to read the several lines softly, as they\\nappeared upon the frame; and where they found three or four words\\ntogether that might make part of a sentence, they dictated to the four\\nremaining boys, who were scribes. This work was repeated three or four\\ntimes, and at every turn, the engine was so contrived, that the words\\nshifted into new places, as the square bits of wood moved upside down.\\n\\nThe frame\\n\\n\\nSix hours a day the young students were employed in this labour; and\\nthe professor showed me several volumes in large folio, already\\ncollected, of broken sentences, which he intended to piece together,\\nand out of those rich materials, to give the world a complete body of\\nall arts and sciences; which, however, might be still improved, and\\nmuch expedited, if the public would raise a fund for making and\\nemploying five hundred such frames in Lagado, and oblige the managers\\nto contribute in common their several collections.\\n\\nHe assured me “that this invention had employed all his thoughts from\\nhis youth; that he had emptied the whole vocabulary into his frame, and\\nmade the strictest computation of the general proportion there is in\\nbooks between the numbers of particles, nouns, and verbs, and other\\nparts of speech.”\\n\\nI made my humblest acknowledgment to this illustrious person, for his\\ngreat communicativeness; and promised, “if ever I had the good fortune\\nto return to my native country, that I would do him justice, as the\\nsole inventor of this wonderful machine;” the form and contrivance of\\nwhich I desired leave to delineate on paper, as in the figure here\\nannexed. I told him, “although it were the custom of our learned in\\nEurope to steal inventions from each other, who had thereby at least\\nthis advantage, that it became a controversy which was the right owner;\\nyet I would take such caution, that he should have the honour entire,\\nwithout a rival.”\\n\\nWe next went to the school of languages, where three professors sat in\\nconsultation upon improving that of their own country.\\n\\nThe first project was to shorten discourse by cutting polysyllables\\ninto one, and leaving out verbs and participles, because, in reality,\\nall things imaginable are but nouns.\\n\\nThe other project was, a scheme for entirely abolishing all words\\nwhatsoever; and this was urged as a great advantage in point of health,\\nas well as brevity. For it is plain, that every word we speak is, in\\nsome degree, a diminution of our lungs by corrosion, and, consequently,\\ncontributes to the shortening of our lives. An expedient was therefore\\noffered, “that since words are only names for _things_, it would be\\nmore convenient for all men to carry about them such things as were\\nnecessary to express a particular business they are to discourse on.”\\nAnd this invention would certainly have taken place, to the great ease\\nas well as health of the subject, if the women, in conjunction with the\\nvulgar and illiterate, had not threatened to raise a rebellion unless\\nthey might be allowed the liberty to speak with their tongues, after\\nthe manner of their forefathers; such constant irreconcilable enemies\\nto science are the common people. However, many of the most learned and\\nwise adhere to the new scheme of expressing themselves by things; which\\nhas only this inconvenience attending it, that if a man’s business be\\nvery great, and of various kinds, he must be obliged, in proportion, to\\ncarry a greater bundle of things upon his back, unless he can afford\\none or two strong servants to attend him. I have often beheld two of\\nthose sages almost sinking under the weight of their packs, like\\npedlars among us, who, when they met in the street, would lay down\\ntheir loads, open their sacks, and hold conversation for an hour\\ntogether; then put up their implements, help each other to resume their\\nburdens, and take their leave.\\n\\nBut for short conversations, a man may carry implements in his pockets,\\nand under his arms, enough to supply him; and in his house, he cannot\\nbe at a loss. Therefore the room where company meet who practise this\\nart, is full of all things, ready at hand, requisite to furnish matter\\nfor this kind of artificial converse.\\n\\nAnother great advantage proposed by this invention was, that it would\\nserve as a universal language, to be understood in all civilised\\nnations, whose goods and utensils are generally of the same kind, or\\nnearly resembling, so that their uses might easily be comprehended. And\\nthus ambassadors would be qualified to treat with foreign princes, or\\nministers of state, to whose tongues they were utter strangers.\\n\\nI was at the mathematical school, where the master taught his pupils\\nafter a method scarce imaginable to us in Europe. The proposition, and\\ndemonstration, were fairly written on a thin wafer, with ink composed\\nof a cephalic tincture. This, the student was to swallow upon a fasting\\nstomach, and for three days following, eat nothing but bread and water.\\nAs the wafer digested, the tincture mounted to his brain, bearing the\\nproposition along with it. But the success has not hitherto been\\nanswerable, partly by some error in the _quantum_ or composition, and\\npartly by the perverseness of lads, to whom this bolus is so nauseous,\\nthat they generally steal aside, and discharge it upwards, before it\\ncan operate; neither have they been yet persuaded to use so long an\\nabstinence, as the prescription requires.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\nA further account of the academy. The author proposes some\\nimprovements, which are honourably received.\\n\\n\\nIn the school of political projectors, I was but ill entertained; the\\nprofessors appearing, in my judgment, wholly out of their senses, which\\nis a scene that never fails to make me melancholy. These unhappy people\\nwere proposing schemes for persuading monarchs to choose favourites\\nupon the score of their wisdom, capacity, and virtue; of teaching\\nministers to consult the public good; of rewarding merit, great\\nabilities, eminent services; of instructing princes to know their true\\ninterest, by placing it on the same foundation with that of their\\npeople; of choosing for employments persons qualified to exercise them,\\nwith many other wild, impossible chimeras, that never entered before\\ninto the heart of man to conceive; and confirmed in me the old\\nobservation, “that there is nothing so extravagant and irrational,\\nwhich some philosophers have not maintained for truth.”\\n\\nBut, however, I shall so far do justice to this part of the Academy, as\\nto acknowledge that all of them were not so visionary. There was a most\\ningenious doctor, who seemed to be perfectly versed in the whole nature\\nand system of government. This illustrious person had very usefully\\nemployed his studies, in finding out effectual remedies for all\\ndiseases and corruptions to which the several kinds of public\\nadministration are subject, by the vices or infirmities of those who\\ngovern, as well as by the licentiousness of those who are to obey. For\\ninstance: whereas all writers and reasoners have agreed, that there is\\na strict universal resemblance between the natural and the political\\nbody; can there be any thing more evident, than that the health of both\\nmust be preserved, and the diseases cured, by the same prescriptions?\\nIt is allowed, that senates and great councils are often troubled with\\nredundant, ebullient, and other peccant humours; with many diseases of\\nthe head, and more of the heart; with strong convulsions, with grievous\\ncontractions of the nerves and sinews in both hands, but especially the\\nright; with spleen, flatus, vertigos, and deliriums; with scrofulous\\ntumours, full of fetid purulent matter; with sour frothy ructations:\\nwith canine appetites, and crudeness of digestion, besides many others,\\nneedless to mention. This doctor therefore proposed, “that upon the\\nmeeting of the senate, certain physicians should attend it the three\\nfirst days of their sitting, and at the close of each day’s debate feel\\nthe pulses of every senator; after which, having maturely considered\\nand consulted upon the nature of the several maladies, and the methods\\nof cure, they should on the fourth day return to the senate house,\\nattended by their apothecaries stored with proper medicines; and before\\nthe members sat, administer to each of them lenitives, aperitives,\\nabstersives, corrosives, restringents, palliatives, laxatives,\\ncephalalgics, icterics, apophlegmatics, acoustics, as their several\\ncases required; and, according as these medicines should operate,\\nrepeat, alter, or omit them, at the next meeting.”\\n\\nThis project could not be of any great expense to the public; and might\\nin my poor opinion, be of much use for the despatch of business, in\\nthose countries where senates have any share in the legislative power;\\nbeget unanimity, shorten debates, open a few mouths which are now\\nclosed, and close many more which are now open; curb the petulancy of\\nthe young, and correct the positiveness of the old; rouse the stupid,\\nand damp the pert.\\n\\nAgain, because it is a general complaint, that the favourites of\\nprinces are troubled with short and weak memories; the same doctor\\nproposed, “that whoever attended a first minister, after having told\\nhis business, with the utmost brevity and in the plainest words,\\nshould, at his departure, give the said minister a tweak by the nose,\\nor a kick in the belly, or tread on his corns, or lug him thrice by\\nboth ears, or run a pin into his breech; or pinch his arm black and\\nblue, to prevent forgetfulness; and at every levee day, repeat the same\\noperation, till the business were done, or absolutely refused.”\\n\\nHe likewise directed, “that every senator in the great council of a\\nnation, after he had delivered his opinion, and argued in the defence\\nof it, should be obliged to give his vote directly contrary; because if\\nthat were done, the result would infallibly terminate in the good of\\nthe public.”\\n\\nWhen parties in a state are violent, he offered a wonderful contrivance\\nto reconcile them. The method is this: You take a hundred leaders of\\neach party; you dispose them into couples of such whose heads are\\nnearest of a size; then let two nice operators saw off the occiput of\\neach couple at the same time, in such a manner that the brain may be\\nequally divided. Let the occiputs, thus cut off, be interchanged,\\napplying each to the head of his opposite party-man. It seems indeed to\\nbe a work that requires some exactness, but the professor assured us,\\n“that if it were dexterously performed, the cure would be infallible.”\\nFor he argued thus: “that the two half brains being left to debate the\\nmatter between themselves within the space of one skull, would soon\\ncome to a good understanding, and produce that moderation, as well as\\nregularity of thinking, so much to be wished for in the heads of those,\\nwho imagine they come into the world only to watch and govern its\\nmotion: and as to the difference of brains, in quantity or quality,\\namong those who are directors in faction,” the doctor assured us, from\\nhis own knowledge, that “it was a perfect trifle.”\\n\\nI heard a very warm debate between two professors, about the most\\ncommodious and effectual ways and means of raising money, without\\ngrieving the subject. The first affirmed, “the justest method would be,\\nto lay a certain tax upon vices and folly; and the sum fixed upon every\\nman to be rated, after the fairest manner, by a jury of his\\nneighbours.” The second was of an opinion directly contrary; “to tax\\nthose qualities of body and mind, for which men chiefly value\\nthemselves; the rate to be more or less, according to the degrees of\\nexcelling; the decision whereof should be left entirely to their own\\nbreast.” The highest tax was upon men who are the greatest favourites\\nof the other sex, and the assessments, according to the number and\\nnature of the favours they have received; for which, they are allowed\\nto be their own vouchers. Wit, valour, and politeness, were likewise\\nproposed to be largely taxed, and collected in the same manner, by\\nevery person’s giving his own word for the quantum of what he\\npossessed. But as to honour, justice, wisdom, and learning, they should\\nnot be taxed at all; because they are qualifications of so singular a\\nkind, that no man will either allow them in his neighbour or value them\\nin himself.\\n\\nThe women were proposed to be taxed according to their beauty and skill\\nin dressing, wherein they had the same privilege with the men, to be\\ndetermined by their own judgment. But constancy, chastity, good sense,\\nand good nature, were not rated, because they would not bear the charge\\nof collecting.\\n\\nTo keep senators in the interest of the crown, it was proposed that the\\nmembers should raffle for employments; every man first taking an oath,\\nand giving security, that he would vote for the court, whether he won\\nor not; after which, the losers had, in their turn, the liberty of\\nraffling upon the next vacancy. Thus, hope and expectation would be\\nkept alive; none would complain of broken promises, but impute their\\ndisappointments wholly to fortune, whose shoulders are broader and\\nstronger than those of a ministry.\\n\\nAnother professor showed me a large paper of instructions for\\ndiscovering plots and conspiracies against the government. He advised\\ngreat statesmen to examine into the diet of all suspected persons;\\ntheir times of eating; upon which side they lay in bed; with which hand\\nthey wipe their posteriors; take a strict view of their excrements,\\nand, from the colour, the odour, the taste, the consistence, the\\ncrudeness or maturity of digestion, form a judgment of their thoughts\\nand designs; because men are never so serious, thoughtful, and intent,\\nas when they are at stool, which he found by frequent experiment; for,\\nin such conjunctures, when he used, merely as a trial, to consider\\nwhich was the best way of murdering the king, his ordure would have a\\ntincture of green; but quite different, when he thought only of raising\\nan insurrection, or burning the metropolis.\\n\\nThe whole discourse was written with great acuteness, containing many\\nobservations, both curious and useful for politicians; but, as I\\nconceived, not altogether complete. This I ventured to tell the author,\\nand offered, if he pleased, to supply him with some additions. He\\nreceived my proposition with more compliance than is usual among\\nwriters, especially those of the projecting species, professing “he\\nwould be glad to receive further information.”\\n\\nI told him, “that in the kingdom of Tribnia, [454a] by the natives\\ncalled Langden, [454b] where I had sojourned some time in my travels,\\nthe bulk of the people consist in a manner wholly of discoverers,\\nwitnesses, informers, accusers, prosecutors, evidences, swearers,\\ntogether with their several subservient and subaltern instruments, all\\nunder the colours, the conduct, and the pay of ministers of state, and\\ntheir deputies. The plots, in that kingdom, are usually the workmanship\\nof those persons who desire to raise their own characters of profound\\npoliticians; to restore new vigour to a crazy administration; to stifle\\nor divert general discontents; to fill their coffers with forfeitures;\\nand raise, or sink the opinion of public credit, as either shall best\\nanswer their private advantage. It is first agreed and settled among\\nthem, what suspected persons shall be accused of a plot; then,\\neffectual care is taken to secure all their letters and papers, and put\\nthe owners in chains. These papers are delivered to a set of artists,\\nvery dexterous in finding out the mysterious meanings of words,\\nsyllables, and letters: for instance, they can discover a close stool,\\nto signify a privy council; a flock of geese, a senate; a lame dog, an\\ninvader; a codshead; a ——; the plague, a standing army; a buzzard, a\\nprime minister; the gout, a high priest; a gibbet, a secretary of\\nstate; a chamber pot, a committee of grandees; a sieve, a court lady; a\\nbroom, a revolution; a mouse-trap, an employment; a bottomless pit, a\\ntreasury; a sink, a court; a cap and bells, a favourite; a broken reed,\\na court of justice; an empty tun, a general; a running sore, the\\nadministration. [455]\\n\\n“When this method fails, they have two others more effectual, which the\\nlearned among them call acrostics and anagrams. First, they can\\ndecipher all initial letters into political meanings. Thus _N_. shall\\nsignify a plot; _B_. a regiment of horse; _L_. a fleet at sea; or,\\nsecondly, by transposing the letters of the alphabet in any suspected\\npaper, they can lay open the deepest designs of a discontented party.\\nSo, for example, if I should say, in a letter to a friend, ‘Our brother\\nTom has just got the piles,’ a skilful decipherer would discover, that\\nthe same letters which compose that sentence, may be analysed into the\\nfollowing words, ‘Resist, a plot is brought home; The tour.’ And this\\nis the anagrammatic method.”\\n\\nThe professor made me great acknowledgments for communicating these\\nobservations, and promised to make honourable mention of me in his\\ntreatise.\\n\\nI saw nothing in this country that could invite me to a longer\\ncontinuance, and began to think of returning home to England.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\nThe author leaves Lagado: arrives at Maldonada. No ship ready. He takes\\na short voyage to Glubbdubdrib. His reception by the governor.\\n\\n\\nThe continent, of which this kingdom is a part, extends itself, as I\\nhave reason to believe, eastward, to that unknown tract of America\\nwestward of California; and north, to the Pacific Ocean, which is not\\nabove a hundred and fifty miles from Lagado; where there is a good\\nport, and much commerce with the great island of Luggnagg, situated to\\nthe north-west about 29 degrees north latitude, and 140 longitude. This\\nisland of Luggnagg stands south-eastward of Japan, about a hundred\\nleagues distant. There is a strict alliance between the Japanese\\nemperor and the king of Luggnagg; which affords frequent opportunities\\nof sailing from one island to the other. I determined therefore to\\ndirect my course this way, in order to direct my return to Europe. I\\nhired two mules, with a guide, to show me the way, and carry my small\\nbaggage. I took leave of my noble protector, who had shown me so much\\nfavour, and made me a generous present at my departure.\\n\\nMy journey was without any accident or adventure worth relating. When I\\narrived at the port of Maldonada (for so it is called) there was no\\nship in the harbour bound for Luggnagg, nor likely to be in some time.\\nThe town is about as large as Portsmouth. I soon fell into some\\nacquaintance, and was very hospitably received. A gentleman of\\ndistinction said to me, “that since the ships bound for Luggnagg could\\nnot be ready in less than a month, it might be no disagreeable\\namusement for me to take a trip to the little island of Glubbdubdrib,\\nabout five leagues off to the south-west.” He offered himself and a\\nfriend to accompany me, and that I should be provided with a small\\nconvenient bark for the voyage.\\n\\nGlubbdubdrib, as nearly as I can interpret the word, signifies the\\nisland of sorcerers or magicians. It is about one third as large as the\\nIsle of Wight, and extremely fruitful: it is governed by the head of a\\ncertain tribe, who are all magicians. This tribe marries only among\\neach other, and the eldest in succession is prince or governor. He has\\na noble palace, and a park of about three thousand acres, surrounded by\\na wall of hewn stone twenty feet high. In this park are several small\\nenclosures for cattle, corn, and gardening.\\n\\nThe governor and his family are served and attended by domestics of a\\nkind somewhat unusual. By his skill in necromancy he has a power of\\ncalling whom he pleases from the dead, and commanding their service for\\ntwenty-four hours, but no longer; nor can he call the same persons up\\nagain in less than three months, except upon very extraordinary\\noccasions.\\n\\nWhen we arrived at the island, which was about eleven in the morning,\\none of the gentlemen who accompanied me went to the governor, and\\ndesired admittance for a stranger, who came on purpose to have the\\nhonour of attending on his highness. This was immediately granted, and\\nwe all three entered the gate of the palace between two rows of guards,\\narmed and dressed after a very antic manner, and with something in\\ntheir countenances that made my flesh creep with a horror I cannot\\nexpress. We passed through several apartments, between servants of the\\nsame sort, ranked on each side as before, till we came to the chamber\\nof presence; where, after three profound obeisances, and a few general\\nquestions, we were permitted to sit on three stools, near the lowest\\nstep of his highness’s throne. He understood the language of\\nBalnibarbi, although it was different from that of this island. He\\ndesired me to give him some account of my travels; and, to let me see\\nthat I should be treated without ceremony, he dismissed all his\\nattendants with a turn of his finger; at which, to my great\\nastonishment, they vanished in an instant, like visions in a dream when\\nwe awake on a sudden. I could not recover myself in some time, till the\\ngovernor assured me, “that I should receive no hurt;” and observing my\\ntwo companions to be under no concern, who had been often entertained\\nin the same manner, I began to take courage, and related to his\\nhighness a short history of my several adventures; yet not without some\\nhesitation, and frequently looking behind me to the place where I had\\nseen those domestic spectres. I had the honour to dine with the\\ngovernor, where a new set of ghosts served up the meat, and waited at\\ntable. I now observed myself to be less terrified than I had been in\\nthe morning. I stayed till sunset, but humbly desired his highness to\\nexcuse me for not accepting his invitation of lodging in the palace. My\\ntwo friends and I lay at a private house in the town adjoining, which\\nis the capital of this little island; and the next morning we returned\\nto pay our duty to the governor, as he was pleased to command us.\\n\\nAfter this manner we continued in the island for ten days, most part of\\nevery day with the governor, and at night in our lodging. I soon grew\\nso familiarized to the sight of spirits, that after the third or fourth\\ntime they gave me no emotion at all: or, if I had any apprehensions\\nleft, my curiosity prevailed over them. For his highness the governor\\nordered me “to call up whatever persons I would choose to name, and in\\nwhatever numbers, among all the dead from the beginning of the world to\\nthe present time, and command them to answer any questions I should\\nthink fit to ask; with this condition, that my questions must be\\nconfined within the compass of the times they lived in. And one thing I\\nmight depend upon, that they would certainly tell me the truth, for\\nlying was a talent of no use in the lower world.”\\n\\nI made my humble acknowledgments to his highness for so great a favour.\\nWe were in a chamber, from whence there was a fair prospect into the\\npark. And because my first inclination was to be entertained with\\nscenes of pomp and magnificence, I desired to see Alexander the Great\\nat the head of his army, just after the battle of Arbela: which, upon a\\nmotion of the governor’s finger, immediately appeared in a large field,\\nunder the window where we stood. Alexander was called up into the room:\\nit was with great difficulty that I understood his Greek, and had but\\nlittle of my own. He assured me upon his honour “that he was not\\npoisoned, but died of a bad fever by excessive drinking.”\\n\\nNext, I saw Hannibal passing the Alps, who told me “he had not a drop\\nof vinegar in his camp.”\\n\\nI saw Cæsar and Pompey at the head of their troops, just ready to\\nengage. I saw the former, in his last great triumph. I desired that the\\nsenate of Rome might appear before me, in one large chamber, and an\\nassembly of somewhat a later age in counterview, in another. The first\\nseemed to be an assembly of heroes and demigods; the other, a knot of\\npedlars, pick-pockets, highwaymen, and bullies.\\n\\nThe governor, at my request, gave the sign for Cæsar and Brutus to\\nadvance towards us. I was struck with a profound veneration at the\\nsight of Brutus, and could easily discover the most consummate virtue,\\nthe greatest intrepidity and firmness of mind, the truest love of his\\ncountry, and general benevolence for mankind, in every lineament of his\\ncountenance. I observed, with much pleasure, that these two persons\\nwere in good intelligence with each other; and Cæsar freely confessed\\nto me, “that the greatest actions of his own life were not equal, by\\nmany degrees, to the glory of taking it away.” I had the honour to have\\nmuch conversation with Brutus; and was told, “that his ancestor Junius,\\nSocrates, Epaminondas, Cato the younger, Sir Thomas More, and himself\\nwere perpetually together:” a sextumvirate, to which all the ages of\\nthe world cannot add a seventh.\\n\\nIt would be tedious to trouble the reader with relating what vast\\nnumbers of illustrious persons were called up to gratify that\\ninsatiable desire I had to see the world in every period of antiquity\\nplaced before me. I chiefly fed my eyes with beholding the destroyers\\nof tyrants and usurpers, and the restorers of liberty to oppressed and\\ninjured nations. But it is impossible to express the satisfaction I\\nreceived in my own mind, after such a manner as to make it a suitable\\nentertainment to the reader.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\nA further account of Glubbdubdrib. Ancient and modern history\\ncorrected.\\n\\n\\nHaving a desire to see those ancients who were most renowned for wit\\nand learning, I set apart one day on purpose. I proposed that Homer and\\nAristotle might appear at the head of all their commentators; but these\\nwere so numerous, that some hundreds were forced to attend in the\\ncourt, and outward rooms of the palace. I knew, and could distinguish\\nthose two heroes, at first sight, not only from the crowd, but from\\neach other. Homer was the taller and comelier person of the two, walked\\nvery erect for one of his age, and his eyes were the most quick and\\npiercing I ever beheld. Aristotle stooped much, and made use of a\\nstaff. His visage was meagre, his hair lank and thin, and his voice\\nhollow. I soon discovered that both of them were perfect strangers to\\nthe rest of the company, and had never seen or heard of them before;\\nand I had a whisper from a ghost who shall be nameless, “that these\\ncommentators always kept in the most distant quarters from their\\nprincipals, in the lower world, through a consciousness of shame and\\nguilt, because they had so horribly misrepresented the meaning of those\\nauthors to posterity.” I introduced Didymus and Eustathius to Homer,\\nand prevailed on him to treat them better than perhaps they deserved,\\nfor he soon found they wanted a genius to enter into the spirit of a\\npoet. But Aristotle was out of all patience with the account I gave him\\nof Scotus and Ramus, as I presented them to him; and he asked them,\\n“whether the rest of the tribe were as great dunces as themselves?”\\n\\nI then desired the governor to call up Descartes and Gassendi, with\\nwhom I prevailed to explain their systems to Aristotle. This great\\nphilosopher freely acknowledged his own mistakes in natural philosophy,\\nbecause he proceeded in many things upon conjecture, as all men must\\ndo; and he found that Gassendi, who had made the doctrine of Epicurus\\nas palatable as he could, and the _vortices_ of Descartes, were equally\\nto be exploded. He predicted the same fate to _attraction_, whereof the\\npresent learned are such zealous asserters. He said, “that new systems\\nof nature were but new fashions, which would vary in every age; and\\neven those, who pretend to demonstrate them from mathematical\\nprinciples, would flourish but a short period of time, and be out of\\nvogue when that was determined.”\\n\\nI spent five days in conversing with many others of the ancient\\nlearned. I saw most of the first Roman emperors. I prevailed on the\\ngovernor to call up Heliogabalus’s cooks to dress us a dinner, but they\\ncould not show us much of their skill, for want of materials. A helot\\nof Agesilaus made us a dish of Spartan broth, but I was not able to get\\ndown a second spoonful.\\n\\nThe two gentlemen, who conducted me to the island, were pressed by\\ntheir private affairs to return in three days, which I employed in\\nseeing some of the modern dead, who had made the greatest figure, for\\ntwo or three hundred years past, in our own and other countries of\\nEurope; and having been always a great admirer of old illustrious\\nfamilies, I desired the governor would call up a dozen or two of kings,\\nwith their ancestors in order for eight or nine generations. But my\\ndisappointment was grievous and unexpected. For, instead of a long\\ntrain with royal diadems, I saw in one family two fiddlers, three\\nspruce courtiers, and an Italian prelate. In another, a barber, an\\nabbot, and two cardinals. I have too great a veneration for crowned\\nheads, to dwell any longer on so nice a subject. But as to counts,\\nmarquises, dukes, earls, and the like, I was not so scrupulous. And I\\nconfess, it was not without some pleasure, that I found myself able to\\ntrace the particular features, by which certain families are\\ndistinguished, up to their originals. I could plainly discover whence\\none family derives a long chin; why a second has abounded with knaves\\nfor two generations, and fools for two more; why a third happened to be\\ncrack-brained, and a fourth to be sharpers; whence it came, what\\nPolydore Virgil says of a certain great house, _Nec vir fortis_, _nec\\nfemina casta_; how cruelty, falsehood, and cowardice, grew to be\\ncharacteristics by which certain families are distinguished as much as\\nby their coats of arms; who first brought the pox into a noble house,\\nwhich has lineally descended scrofulous tumours to their posterity.\\nNeither could I wonder at all this, when I saw such an interruption of\\nlineages, by pages, lackeys, valets, coachmen, gamesters, fiddlers,\\nplayers, captains, and pickpockets.\\n\\nI was chiefly disgusted with modern history. For having strictly\\nexamined all the persons of greatest name in the courts of princes, for\\na hundred years past, I found how the world had been misled by\\nprostitute writers, to ascribe the greatest exploits in war, to\\ncowards; the wisest counsel, to fools; sincerity, to flatterers; Roman\\nvirtue, to betrayers of their country; piety, to atheists; chastity, to\\nsodomites; truth, to informers: how many innocent and excellent persons\\nhad been condemned to death or banishment by the practising of great\\nministers upon the corruption of judges, and the malice of factions:\\nhow many villains had been exalted to the highest places of trust,\\npower, dignity, and profit: how great a share in the motions and events\\nof courts, councils, and senates might be challenged by bawds, whores,\\npimps, parasites, and buffoons. How low an opinion I had of human\\nwisdom and integrity, when I was truly informed of the springs and\\nmotives of great enterprises and revolutions in the world, and of the\\ncontemptible accidents to which they owed their success.\\n\\nHere I discovered the roguery and ignorance of those who pretend to\\nwrite anecdotes, or secret history; who send so many kings to their\\ngraves with a cup of poison; will repeat the discourse between a prince\\nand chief minister, where no witness was by; unlock the thoughts and\\ncabinets of ambassadors and secretaries of state; and have the\\nperpetual misfortune to be mistaken. Here I discovered the true causes\\nof many great events that have surprised the world; how a whore can\\ngovern the back-stairs, the back-stairs a council, and the council a\\nsenate. A general confessed, in my presence, “that he got a victory\\npurely by the force of cowardice and ill conduct;” and an admiral,\\n“that, for want of proper intelligence, he beat the enemy, to whom he\\nintended to betray the fleet.” Three kings protested to me, “that in\\ntheir whole reigns they never did once prefer any person of merit,\\nunless by mistake, or treachery of some minister in whom they confided;\\nneither would they do it if they were to live again:” and they showed,\\nwith great strength of reason, “that the royal throne could not be\\nsupported without corruption, because that positive, confident, restiff\\ntemper, which virtue infused into a man, was a perpetual clog to public\\nbusiness.”\\n\\nI had the curiosity to inquire in a particular manner, by what methods\\ngreat numbers had procured to themselves high titles of honour, and\\nprodigious estates; and I confined my inquiry to a very modern period:\\nhowever, without grating upon present times, because I would be sure to\\ngive no offence even to foreigners (for I hope the reader need not be\\ntold, that I do not in the least intend my own country, in what I say\\nupon this occasion,) a great number of persons concerned were called\\nup; and, upon a very slight examination, discovered such a scene of\\ninfamy, that I cannot reflect upon it without some seriousness.\\nPerjury, oppression, subornation, fraud, pandarism, and the like\\ninfirmities, were among the most excusable arts they had to mention;\\nand for these I gave, as it was reasonable, great allowance. But when\\nsome confessed they owed their greatness and wealth to sodomy, or\\nincest; others, to the prostituting of their own wives and daughters;\\nothers, to the betraying of their country or their prince; some, to\\npoisoning; more to the perverting of justice, in order to destroy the\\ninnocent, I hope I may be pardoned, if these discoveries inclined me a\\nlittle to abate of that profound veneration, which I am naturally apt\\nto pay to persons of high rank, who ought to be treated with the utmost\\nrespect due to their sublime dignity, by us their inferiors.\\n\\nI had often read of some great services done to princes and states, and\\ndesired to see the persons by whom those services were performed. Upon\\ninquiry I was told, “that their names were to be found on no record,\\nexcept a few of them, whom history has represented as the vilest of\\nrogues and traitors.” As to the rest, I had never once heard of them.\\nThey all appeared with dejected looks, and in the meanest habit; most\\nof them telling me, “they died in poverty and disgrace, and the rest on\\na scaffold or a gibbet.”\\n\\nAmong others, there was one person, whose case appeared a little\\nsingular. He had a youth about eighteen years old standing by his side.\\nHe told me, “he had for many years been commander of a ship; and in the\\nsea fight at Actium had the good fortune to break through the enemy’s\\ngreat line of battle, sink three of their capital ships, and take a\\nfourth, which was the sole cause of Antony’s flight, and of the victory\\nthat ensued; that the youth standing by him, his only son, was killed\\nin the action.” He added, “that upon the confidence of some merit, the\\nwar being at an end, he went to Rome, and solicited at the court of\\nAugustus to be preferred to a greater ship, whose commander had been\\nkilled; but, without any regard to his pretensions, it was given to a\\nboy who had never seen the sea, the son of Libertina, who waited on one\\nof the emperor’s mistresses. Returning back to his own vessel, he was\\ncharged with neglect of duty, and the ship given to a favourite page of\\nPublicola, the vice-admiral; whereupon he retired to a poor farm at a\\ngreat distance from Rome, and there ended his life.” I was so curious\\nto know the truth of this story, that I desired Agrippa might be\\ncalled, who was admiral in that fight. He appeared, and confirmed the\\nwhole account: but with much more advantage to the captain, whose\\nmodesty had extenuated or concealed a great part of his merit.\\n\\nI was surprised to find corruption grown so high and so quick in that\\nempire, by the force of luxury so lately introduced; which made me less\\nwonder at many parallel cases in other countries, where vices of all\\nkinds have reigned so much longer, and where the whole praise, as well\\nas pillage, has been engrossed by the chief commander, who perhaps had\\nthe least title to either.\\n\\nAs every person called up made exactly the same appearance he had done\\nin the world, it gave me melancholy reflections to observe how much the\\nrace of humankind was degenerated among us within these hundred years\\npast; how the pox, under all its consequences and denominations had\\naltered every lineament of an English countenance; shortened the size\\nof bodies, unbraced the nerves, relaxed the sinews and muscles,\\nintroduced a sallow complexion, and rendered the flesh loose and\\nrancid.\\n\\nI descended so low, as to desire some English yeoman of the old stamp\\nmight be summoned to appear; once so famous for the simplicity of their\\nmanners, diet, and dress; for justice in their dealings; for their true\\nspirit of liberty; for their valour, and love of their country. Neither\\ncould I be wholly unmoved, after comparing the living with the dead,\\nwhen I considered how all these pure native virtues were prostituted\\nfor a piece of money by their grand-children; who, in selling their\\nvotes and managing at elections, have acquired every vice and\\ncorruption that can possibly be learned in a court.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\nThe author returns to Maldonada. Sails to the kingdom of Luggnagg. The\\nauthor confined. He is sent for to court. The manner of his admittance.\\nThe king’s great lenity to his subjects.\\n\\n\\nThe day of our departure being come, I took leave of his highness, the\\nGovernor of Glubbdubdrib, and returned with my two companions to\\nMaldonada, where, after a fortnight’s waiting, a ship was ready to sail\\nfor Luggnagg. The two gentlemen, and some others, were so generous and\\nkind as to furnish me with provisions, and see me on board. I was a\\nmonth in this voyage. We had one violent storm, and were under a\\nnecessity of steering westward to get into the trade wind, which holds\\nfor above sixty leagues. On the 21st of April, 1708, we sailed into the\\nriver of Clumegnig, which is a seaport town, at the south-east point of\\nLuggnagg. We cast anchor within a league of the town, and made a signal\\nfor a pilot. Two of them came on board in less than half an hour, by\\nwhom we were guided between certain shoals and rocks, which are very\\ndangerous in the passage, to a large basin, where a fleet may ride in\\nsafety within a cable’s length of the town-wall.\\n\\nSome of our sailors, whether out of treachery or inadvertence, had\\ninformed the pilots “that I was a stranger, and great traveller;”\\nwhereof these gave notice to a custom-house officer, by whom I was\\nexamined very strictly upon my landing. This officer spoke to me in the\\nlanguage of Balnibarbi, which, by the force of much commerce, is\\ngenerally understood in that town, especially by seamen and those\\nemployed in the customs. I gave him a short account of some\\nparticulars, and made my story as plausible and consistent as I could;\\nbut I thought it necessary to disguise my country, and call myself a\\nHollander; because my intentions were for Japan, and I knew the Dutch\\nwere the only Europeans permitted to enter into that kingdom. I\\ntherefore told the officer, “that having been shipwrecked on the coast\\nof Balnibarbi, and cast on a rock, I was received up into Laputa, or\\nthe flying island (of which he had often heard), and was now\\nendeavouring to get to Japan, whence I might find a convenience of\\nreturning to my own country.” The officer said, “I must be confined\\ntill he could receive orders from court, for which he would write\\nimmediately, and hoped to receive an answer in a fortnight.” I was\\ncarried to a convenient lodging with a sentry placed at the door;\\nhowever, I had the liberty of a large garden, and was treated with\\nhumanity enough, being maintained all the time at the king’s charge. I\\nwas invited by several persons, chiefly out of curiosity, because it\\nwas reported that I came from countries very remote, of which they had\\nnever heard.\\n\\nI hired a young man, who came in the same ship, to be an interpreter;\\nhe was a native of Luggnagg, but had lived some years at Maldonada, and\\nwas a perfect master of both languages. By his assistance, I was able\\nto hold a conversation with those who came to visit me; but this\\nconsisted only of their questions, and my answers.\\n\\nThe despatch came from court about the time we expected. It contained a\\nwarrant for conducting me and my retinue to _Traldragdubh_, or\\n_Trildrogdrib_ (for it is pronounced both ways as near as I can\\nremember), by a party of ten horse. All my retinue was that poor lad\\nfor an interpreter, whom I persuaded into my service, and, at my humble\\nrequest, we had each of us a mule to ride on. A messenger was\\ndespatched half a day’s journey before us, to give the king notice of\\nmy approach, and to desire, “that his majesty would please to appoint a\\nday and hour, when it would by his gracious pleasure that I might have\\nthe honour to lick the dust before his footstool.” This is the court\\nstyle, and I found it to be more than matter of form: for, upon my\\nadmittance two days after my arrival, I was commanded to crawl upon my\\nbelly, and lick the floor as I advanced; but, on account of my being a\\nstranger, care was taken to have it made so clean, that the dust was\\nnot offensive. However, this was a peculiar grace, not allowed to any\\nbut persons of the highest rank, when they desire an admittance. Nay,\\nsometimes the floor is strewed with dust on purpose, when the person to\\nbe admitted happens to have powerful enemies at court; and I have seen\\na great lord with his mouth so crammed, that when he had crept to the\\nproper distance from the throne; he was not able to speak a word.\\nNeither is there any remedy; because it is capital for those who\\nreceive an audience to spit or wipe their mouths in his majesty’s\\npresence. There is indeed another custom, which I cannot altogether\\napprove of: when the king has a mind to put any of his nobles to death\\nin a gentle indulgent manner, he commands the floor to be strewed with\\na certain brown powder of a deadly composition, which being licked up,\\ninfallibly kills him in twenty-four hours. But in justice to this\\nprince’s great clemency, and the care he has of his subjects’ lives\\n(wherein it were much to be wished that the Monarchs of Europe would\\nimitate him), it must be mentioned for his honour, that strict orders\\nare given to have the infected parts of the floor well washed after\\nevery such execution, which, if his domestics neglect, they are in\\ndanger of incurring his royal displeasure. I myself heard him give\\ndirections, that one of his pages should be whipped, whose turn it was\\nto give notice about washing the floor after an execution, but\\nmaliciously had omitted it; by which neglect a young lord of great\\nhopes, coming to an audience, was unfortunately poisoned, although the\\nking at that time had no design against his life. But this good prince\\nwas so gracious as to forgive the poor page his whipping, upon promise\\nthat he would do so no more, without special orders.\\n\\nTo return from this digression. When I had crept within four yards of\\nthe throne, I raised myself gently upon my knees, and then striking my\\nforehead seven times against the ground, I pronounced the following\\nwords, as they had been taught me the night before, _Ickpling\\ngloffthrobb squutserumm blhiop mlashnalt zwin tnodbalkguffh slhiophad\\ngurdlubh asht_. This is the compliment, established by the laws of the\\nland, for all persons admitted to the king’s presence. It may be\\nrendered into English thus: “May your celestial majesty outlive the\\nsun, eleven moons and a half!” To this the king returned some answer,\\nwhich, although I could not understand, yet I replied as I had been\\ndirected: _Fluft drin yalerick dwuldom prastrad mirpush_, which\\nproperly signifies, “My tongue is in the mouth of my friend;” and by\\nthis expression was meant, that I desired leave to bring my\\ninterpreter; whereupon the young man already mentioned was accordingly\\nintroduced, by whose intervention I answered as many questions as his\\nmajesty could put in above an hour. I spoke in the Balnibarbian tongue,\\nand my interpreter delivered my meaning in that of Luggnagg.\\n\\nThe king was much delighted with my company, and ordered his\\n_bliffmarklub_, or high-chamberlain, to appoint a lodging in the court\\nfor me and my interpreter; with a daily allowance for my table, and a\\nlarge purse of gold for my common expenses.\\n\\nI staid three months in this country, out of perfect obedience to his\\nmajesty; who was pleased highly to favour me, and made me very\\nhonourable offers. But I thought it more consistent with prudence and\\njustice to pass the remainder of my days with my wife and family.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\nThe Luggnaggians commended. A particular description of the\\nStruldbrugs, with many conversations between the author and some\\neminent persons upon that subject.\\n\\n\\nThe Luggnaggians are a polite and generous people; and although they\\nare not without some share of that pride which is peculiar to all\\nEastern countries, yet they show themselves courteous to strangers,\\nespecially such who are countenanced by the court. I had many\\nacquaintance, and among persons of the best fashion; and being always\\nattended by my interpreter, the conversation we had was not\\ndisagreeable.\\n\\nOne day, in much good company, I was asked by a person of quality,\\n“whether I had seen any of their _struldbrugs_, or immortals?” I said,\\n“I had not;” and desired he would explain to me “what he meant by such\\nan appellation, applied to a mortal creature.” He told me “that\\nsometimes, though very rarely, a child happened to be born in a family,\\nwith a red circular spot in the forehead, directly over the left\\neyebrow, which was an infallible mark that it should never die.” The\\nspot, as he described it, “was about the compass of a silver\\nthreepence, but in the course of time grew larger, and changed its\\ncolour; for at twelve years old it became green, so continued till five\\nand twenty, then turned to a deep blue: at five and forty it grew coal\\nblack, and as large as an English shilling; but never admitted any\\nfurther alteration.” He said, “these births were so rare, that he did\\nnot believe there could be above eleven hundred struldbrugs, of both\\nsexes, in the whole kingdom; of which he computed about fifty in the\\nmetropolis, and, among the rest, a young girl born about three years\\nago: that these productions were not peculiar to any family, but a mere\\neffect of chance; and the children of the _struldbrugs_ themselves were\\nequally mortal with the rest of the people.”\\n\\nI freely own myself to have been struck with inexpressible delight,\\nupon hearing this account: and the person who gave it me happening to\\nunderstand the Balnibarbian language, which I spoke very well, I could\\nnot forbear breaking out into expressions, perhaps a little too\\nextravagant. I cried out, as in a rapture, “Happy nation, where every\\nchild hath at least a chance for being immortal! Happy people, who\\nenjoy so many living examples of ancient virtue, and have masters ready\\nto instruct them in the wisdom of all former ages! but happiest, beyond\\nall comparison, are those excellent _struldbrugs_, who, being born\\nexempt from that universal calamity of human nature, have their minds\\nfree and disengaged, without the weight and depression of spirits\\ncaused by the continual apprehensions of death!” I discovered my\\nadmiration, “that I had not observed any of these illustrious persons\\nat court; the black spot on the forehead being so remarkable a\\ndistinction, that I could not have easily overlooked it: and it was\\nimpossible that his majesty, a most judicious prince, should not\\nprovide himself with a good number of such wise and able counsellors.\\nYet perhaps the virtue of those reverend sages was too strict for the\\ncorrupt and libertine manners of a court: and we often find by\\nexperience, that young men are too opinionated and volatile to be\\nguided by the sober dictates of their seniors. However, since the king\\nwas pleased to allow me access to his royal person, I was resolved,\\nupon the very first occasion, to deliver my opinion to him on this\\nmatter freely and at large, by the help of my interpreter; and whether\\nhe would please to take my advice or not, yet in one thing I was\\ndetermined, that his majesty having frequently offered me an\\nestablishment in this country, I would, with great thankfulness, accept\\nthe favour, and pass my life here in the conversation of those superior\\nbeings the _struldbrugs_, if they would please to admit me.”\\n\\nThe gentleman to whom I addressed my discourse, because (as I have\\nalready observed) he spoke the language of Balnibarbi, said to me, with\\na sort of a smile which usually arises from pity to the ignorant, “that\\nhe was glad of any occasion to keep me among them, and desired my\\npermission to explain to the company what I had spoke.” He did so, and\\nthey talked together for some time in their own language, whereof I\\nunderstood not a syllable, neither could I observe by their\\ncountenances, what impression my discourse had made on them. After a\\nshort silence, the same person told me, “that his friends and mine (so\\nhe thought fit to express himself) were very much pleased with the\\njudicious remarks I had made on the great happiness and advantages of\\nimmortal life, and they were desirous to know, in a particular manner,\\nwhat scheme of living I should have formed to myself, if it had fallen\\nto my lot to have been born a _struldbrug_.”\\n\\nI answered, “it was easy to be eloquent on so copious and delightful a\\nsubject, especially to me, who had been often apt to amuse myself with\\nvisions of what I should do, if I were a king, a general, or a great\\nlord: and upon this very case, I had frequently run over the whole\\nsystem how I should employ myself, and pass the time, if I were sure to\\nlive for ever.\\n\\n“That, if it had been my good fortune to come into the world a\\n_struldbrug_, as soon as I could discover my own happiness, by\\nunderstanding the difference between life and death, I would first\\nresolve, by all arts and methods, whatsoever, to procure myself riches.\\nIn the pursuit of which, by thrift and management, I might reasonably\\nexpect, in about two hundred years, to be the wealthiest man in the\\nkingdom. In the second place, I would, from my earliest youth, apply\\nmyself to the study of arts and sciences, by which I should arrive in\\ntime to excel all others in learning. Lastly, I would carefully record\\nevery action and event of consequence, that happened in the public,\\nimpartially draw the characters of the several successions of princes\\nand great ministers of state, with my own observations on every point.\\nI would exactly set down the several changes in customs, language,\\nfashions of dress, diet, and diversions. By all which acquirements, I\\nshould be a living treasure of knowledge and wisdom, and certainly\\nbecome the oracle of the nation.\\n\\n“I would never marry after threescore, but live in a hospitable manner,\\nyet still on the saving side. I would entertain myself in forming and\\ndirecting the minds of hopeful young men, by convincing them, from my\\nown remembrance, experience, and observation, fortified by numerous\\nexamples, of the usefulness of virtue in public and private life. But\\nmy choice and constant companions should be a set of my own immortal\\nbrotherhood; among whom, I would elect a dozen from the most ancient,\\ndown to my own contemporaries. Where any of these wanted fortunes, I\\nwould provide them with convenient lodges round my own estate, and have\\nsome of them always at my table; only mingling a few of the most\\nvaluable among you mortals, whom length of time would harden me to lose\\nwith little or no reluctance, and treat your posterity after the same\\nmanner; just as a man diverts himself with the annual succession of\\npinks and tulips in his garden, without regretting the loss of those\\nwhich withered the preceding year.\\n\\n“These _struldbrugs_ and I would mutually communicate our observations\\nand memorials, through the course of time; remark the several\\ngradations by which corruption steals into the world, and oppose it in\\nevery step, by giving perpetual warning and instruction to mankind;\\nwhich, added to the strong influence of our own example, would probably\\nprevent that continual degeneracy of human nature so justly complained\\nof in all ages.\\n\\n“Add to this, the pleasure of seeing the various revolutions of states\\nand empires; the changes in the lower and upper world; ancient cities\\nin ruins, and obscure villages become the seats of kings; famous rivers\\nlessening into shallow brooks; the ocean leaving one coast dry, and\\noverwhelming another; the discovery of many countries yet unknown;\\nbarbarity overrunning the politest nations, and the most barbarous\\nbecome civilized. I should then see the discovery of the longitude, the\\nperpetual motion, the universal medicine, and many other great\\ninventions, brought to the utmost perfection.\\n\\n“What wonderful discoveries should we make in astronomy, by outliving\\nand confirming our own predictions; by observing the progress and\\nreturn of comets, with the changes of motion in the sun, moon, and\\nstars!”\\n\\nI enlarged upon many other topics, which the natural desire of endless\\nlife, and sublunary happiness, could easily furnish me with. When I had\\nended, and the sum of my discourse had been interpreted, as before, to\\nthe rest of the company, there was a good deal of talk among them in\\nthe language of the country, not without some laughter at my expense.\\nAt last, the same gentleman who had been my interpreter, said, “he was\\ndesired by the rest to set me right in a few mistakes, which I had\\nfallen into through the common imbecility of human nature, and upon\\nthat allowance was less answerable for them. That this breed of\\n_struldbrugs_ was peculiar to their country, for there were no such\\npeople either in Balnibarbi or Japan, where he had the honour to be\\nambassador from his majesty, and found the natives in both those\\nkingdoms very hard to believe that the fact was possible: and it\\nappeared from my astonishment when he first mentioned the matter to me,\\nthat I received it as a thing wholly new, and scarcely to be credited.\\nThat in the two kingdoms above mentioned, where, during his residence,\\nhe had conversed very much, he observed long life to be the universal\\ndesire and wish of mankind. That whoever had one foot in the grave was\\nsure to hold back the other as strongly as he could. That the oldest\\nhad still hopes of living one day longer, and looked on death as the\\ngreatest evil, from which nature always prompted him to retreat. Only\\nin this island of Luggnagg the appetite for living was not so eager,\\nfrom the continual example of the _struldbrugs_ before their eyes.\\n\\n“That the system of living contrived by me, was unreasonable and\\nunjust; because it supposed a perpetuity of youth, health, and vigour,\\nwhich no man could be so foolish to hope, however extravagant he may be\\nin his wishes. That the question therefore was not, whether a man would\\nchoose to be always in the prime of youth, attended with prosperity and\\nhealth; but how he would pass a perpetual life under all the usual\\ndisadvantages which old age brings along with it. For although few men\\nwill avow their desires of being immortal, upon such hard conditions,\\nyet in the two kingdoms before mentioned, of Balnibarbi and Japan, he\\nobserved that every man desired to put off death some time longer, let\\nit approach ever so late: and he rarely heard of any man who died\\nwillingly, except he were incited by the extremity of grief or torture.\\nAnd he appealed to me, whether in those countries I had travelled, as\\nwell as my own, I had not observed the same general disposition.”\\n\\nAfter this preface, he gave me a particular account of the\\n_struldbrugs_ among them. He said, “they commonly acted like mortals\\ntill about thirty years old; after which, by degrees, they grew\\nmelancholy and dejected, increasing in both till they came to\\nfourscore. This he learned from their own confession: for otherwise,\\nthere not being above two or three of that species born in an age, they\\nwere too few to form a general observation by. When they came to\\nfourscore years, which is reckoned the extremity of living in this\\ncountry, they had not only all the follies and infirmities of other old\\nmen, but many more which arose from the dreadful prospect of never\\ndying. They were not only opinionative, peevish, covetous, morose,\\nvain, talkative, but incapable of friendship, and dead to all natural\\naffection, which never descended below their grandchildren. Envy and\\nimpotent desires are their prevailing passions. But those objects\\nagainst which their envy seems principally directed, are the vices of\\nthe younger sort and the deaths of the old. By reflecting on the\\nformer, they find themselves cut off from all possibility of pleasure;\\nand whenever they see a funeral, they lament and repine that others\\nhave gone to a harbour of rest to which they themselves never can hope\\nto arrive. They have no remembrance of anything but what they learned\\nand observed in their youth and middle-age, and even that is very\\nimperfect; and for the truth or particulars of any fact, it is safer to\\ndepend on common tradition, than upon their best recollections. The\\nleast miserable among them appear to be those who turn to dotage, and\\nentirely lose their memories; these meet with more pity and assistance,\\nbecause they want many bad qualities which abound in others.\\n\\n“If a _struldbrug_ happen to marry one of his own kind, the marriage is\\ndissolved of course, by the courtesy of the kingdom, as soon as the\\nyounger of the two comes to be fourscore; for the law thinks it a\\nreasonable indulgence, that those who are condemned, without any fault\\nof their own, to a perpetual continuance in the world, should not have\\ntheir misery doubled by the load of a wife.\\n\\n“As soon as they have completed the term of eighty years, they are\\nlooked on as dead in law; their heirs immediately succeed to their\\nestates; only a small pittance is reserved for their support; and the\\npoor ones are maintained at the public charge. After that period, they\\nare held incapable of any employment of trust or profit; they cannot\\npurchase lands, or take leases; neither are they allowed to be\\nwitnesses in any cause, either civil or criminal, not even for the\\ndecision of meers and bounds.\\n\\n“At ninety, they lose their teeth and hair; they have at that age no\\ndistinction of taste, but eat and drink whatever they can get, without\\nrelish or appetite. The diseases they were subject to still continue,\\nwithout increasing or diminishing. In talking, they forget the common\\nappellation of things, and the names of persons, even of those who are\\ntheir nearest friends and relations. For the same reason, they never\\ncan amuse themselves with reading, because their memory will not serve\\nto carry them from the beginning of a sentence to the end; and by this\\ndefect, they are deprived of the only entertainment whereof they might\\notherwise be capable.\\n\\n“The language of this country being always upon the flux, the\\n_struldbrugs_ of one age do not understand those of another; neither\\nare they able, after two hundred years, to hold any conversation\\n(farther than by a few general words) with their neighbours the\\nmortals; and thus they lie under the disadvantage of living like\\nforeigners in their own country.”\\n\\nThis was the account given me of the _struldbrugs_, as near as I can\\nremember. I afterwards saw five or six of different ages, the youngest\\nnot above two hundred years old, who were brought to me at several\\ntimes by some of my friends; but although they were told, “that I was a\\ngreat traveller, and had seen all the world,” they had not the least\\ncuriosity to ask me a question; only desired “I would give them\\n_slumskudask_,” or a token of remembrance; which is a modest way of\\nbegging, to avoid the law, that strictly forbids it, because they are\\nprovided for by the public, although indeed with a very scanty\\nallowance.\\n\\nThey are despised and hated by all sorts of people. When one of them is\\nborn, it is reckoned ominous, and their birth is recorded very\\nparticularly so that you may know their age by consulting the register,\\nwhich, however, has not been kept above a thousand years past, or at\\nleast has been destroyed by time or public disturbances. But the usual\\nway of computing how old they are, is by asking them what kings or\\ngreat persons they can remember, and then consulting history; for\\ninfallibly the last prince in their mind did not begin his reign after\\nthey were fourscore years old.\\n\\nThey were the most mortifying sight I ever beheld; and the women more\\nhorrible than the men. Besides the usual deformities in extreme old\\nage, they acquired an additional ghastliness, in proportion to their\\nnumber of years, which is not to be described; and among half a dozen,\\nI soon distinguished which was the eldest, although there was not above\\na century or two between them.\\n\\nThe reader will easily believe, that from what I had heard and seen, my\\nkeen appetite for perpetuity of life was much abated. I grew heartily\\nashamed of the pleasing visions I had formed; and thought no tyrant\\ncould invent a death into which I would not run with pleasure, from\\nsuch a life. The king heard of all that had passed between me and my\\nfriends upon this occasion, and rallied me very pleasantly; wishing I\\ncould send a couple of _struldbrugs_ to my own country, to arm our\\npeople against the fear of death; but this, it seems, is forbidden by\\nthe fundamental laws of the kingdom, or else I should have been well\\ncontent with the trouble and expense of transporting them.\\n\\nI could not but agree, that the laws of this kingdom relative to the\\n_struldbrugs_ were founded upon the strongest reasons, and such as any\\nother country would be under the necessity of enacting, in the like\\ncircumstances. Otherwise, as avarice is the necessary consequence of\\nold age, those immortals would in time become proprietors of the whole\\nnation, and engross the civil power, which, for want of abilities to\\nmanage, must end in the ruin of the public.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\nThe author leaves Luggnagg, and sails to Japan. From thence he returns\\nin a Dutch ship to Amsterdam, and from Amsterdam to England.\\n\\n\\nI thought this account of the _struldbrugs_ might be some entertainment\\nto the reader, because it seems to be a little out of the common way;\\nat least I do not remember to have met the like in any book of travels\\nthat has come to my hands; and if I am deceived, my excuse must be,\\nthat it is necessary for travellers who describe the same country, very\\noften to agree in dwelling on the same particulars, without deserving\\nthe censure of having borrowed or transcribed from those who wrote\\nbefore them.\\n\\nThere is indeed a perpetual commerce between this kingdom and the great\\nempire of Japan; and it is very probable, that the Japanese authors may\\nhave given some account of the _struldbrugs_; but my stay in Japan was\\nso short, and I was so entirely a stranger to the language, that I was\\nnot qualified to make any inquiries. But I hope the Dutch, upon this\\nnotice, will be curious and able enough to supply my defects.\\n\\nHis majesty having often pressed me to accept some employment in his\\ncourt, and finding me absolutely determined to return to my native\\ncountry, was pleased to give me his license to depart; and honoured me\\nwith a letter of recommendation, under his own hand, to the Emperor of\\nJapan. He likewise presented me with four hundred and forty-four large\\npieces of gold (this nation delighting in even numbers), and a red\\ndiamond, which I sold in England for eleven hundred pounds.\\n\\nOn the 6th day of May, 1709, I took a solemn leave of his majesty, and\\nall my friends. This prince was so gracious as to order a guard to\\nconduct me to Glanguenstald, which is a royal port to the south-west\\npart of the island. In six days I found a vessel ready to carry me to\\nJapan, and spent fifteen days in the voyage. We landed at a small\\nport-town called Xamoschi, situated on the south-east part of Japan;\\nthe town lies on the western point, where there is a narrow strait\\nleading northward into a long arm of the sea, upon the north-west part\\nof which, Yedo, the metropolis, stands. At landing, I showed the\\ncustom-house officers my letter from the king of Luggnagg to his\\nimperial majesty. They knew the seal perfectly well; it was as broad as\\nthe palm of my hand. The impression was, _A king lifting up a lame\\nbeggar from the earth_. The magistrates of the town, hearing of my\\nletter, received me as a public minister. They provided me with\\ncarriages and servants, and bore my charges to Yedo; where I was\\nadmitted to an audience, and delivered my letter, which was opened with\\ngreat ceremony, and explained to the Emperor by an interpreter, who\\nthen gave me notice, by his majesty’s order, “that I should signify my\\nrequest, and, whatever it were, it should be granted, for the sake of\\nhis royal brother of Luggnagg.” This interpreter was a person employed\\nto transact affairs with the Hollanders. He soon conjectured, by my\\ncountenance, that I was a European, and therefore repeated his\\nmajesty’s commands in Low Dutch, which he spoke perfectly well. I\\nanswered, as I had before determined, “that I was a Dutch merchant,\\nshipwrecked in a very remote country, whence I had travelled by sea and\\nland to Luggnagg, and then took shipping for Japan; where I knew my\\ncountrymen often traded, and with some of these I hoped to get an\\nopportunity of returning into Europe: I therefore most humbly entreated\\nhis royal favour, to give order that I should be conducted in safety to\\nNangasac.” To this I added another petition, “that for the sake of my\\npatron the king of Luggnagg, his majesty would condescend to excuse my\\nperforming the ceremony imposed on my countrymen, of trampling upon the\\ncrucifix, because I had been thrown into his kingdom by my misfortunes,\\nwithout any intention of trading.” When this latter petition was\\ninterpreted to the Emperor, he seemed a little surprised; and said, “he\\nbelieved I was the first of my countrymen who ever made any scruple in\\nthis point; and that he began to doubt, whether I was a real Hollander,\\nor not; but rather suspected I must be a Christian. However, for the\\nreasons I had offered, but chiefly to gratify the king of Luggnagg by\\nan uncommon mark of his favour, he would comply with the singularity of\\nmy humour; but the affair must be managed with dexterity, and his\\nofficers should be commanded to let me pass, as it were by\\nforgetfulness. For he assured me, that if the secret should be\\ndiscovered by my countrymen the Dutch, they would cut my throat in the\\nvoyage.” I returned my thanks, by the interpreter, for so unusual a\\nfavour; and some troops being at that time on their march to Nangasac,\\nthe commanding officer had orders to convey me safe thither, with\\nparticular instructions about the business of the crucifix.\\n\\nOn the 9th day of June, 1709, I arrived at Nangasac, after a very long\\nand troublesome journey. I soon fell into the company of some Dutch\\nsailors belonging to the Amboyna, of Amsterdam, a stout ship of 450\\ntons. I had lived long in Holland, pursuing my studies at Leyden, and I\\nspoke Dutch well. The seamen soon knew from whence I came last: they\\nwere curious to inquire into my voyages and course of life. I made up a\\nstory as short and probable as I could, but concealed the greatest\\npart. I knew many persons in Holland. I was able to invent names for my\\nparents, whom I pretended to be obscure people in the province of\\nGelderland. I would have given the captain (one Theodorus Vangrult)\\nwhat he pleased to ask for my voyage to Holland; but understanding I\\nwas a surgeon, he was contented to take half the usual rate, on\\ncondition that I would serve him in the way of my calling. Before we\\ntook shipping, I was often asked by some of the crew, whether I had\\nperformed the ceremony above mentioned. I evaded the question by\\ngeneral answers; “that I had satisfied the Emperor and court in all\\nparticulars.” However, a malicious rogue of a skipper went to an\\nofficer, and pointing to me, told him, “I had not yet trampled on the\\ncrucifix;” but the other, who had received instructions to let me pass,\\ngave the rascal twenty strokes on the shoulders with a bamboo; after\\nwhich I was no more troubled with such questions.\\n\\nNothing happened worth mentioning in this voyage. We sailed with a fair\\nwind to the Cape of Good Hope, where we staid only to take in fresh\\nwater. On the 10th of April, 1710, we arrived safe at Amsterdam, having\\nlost only three men by sickness in the voyage, and a fourth, who fell\\nfrom the foremast into the sea, not far from the coast of Guinea. From\\nAmsterdam I soon after set sail for England, in a small vessel\\nbelonging to that city.\\n\\nOn the 16th of April, 1710, we put in at the Downs. I landed next\\nmorning, and saw once more my native country, after an absence of five\\nyears and six months complete. I went straight to Redriff, where I\\narrived the same day at two in the afternoon, and found my wife and\\nfamily in good health.\\n\\n\\nPART IV. A VOYAGE TO THE COUNTRY OF THE HOUYHNHNMS.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\n\\nThe author sets out as captain of a ship. His men conspire against him,\\nconfine him a long time to his cabin, and set him on shore in an\\nunknown land. He travels up into the country. The Yahoos, a strange\\nsort of animal, described. The author meets two Houyhnhnms.\\n\\n\\nI continued at home with my wife and children about five months in a\\nvery happy condition, if I could have learned the lesson of knowing\\nwhen I was well. I left my poor wife big with child, and accepted an\\nadvantageous offer made me to be captain of the Adventurer, a stout\\nmerchantman of 350 tons: for I understood navigation well, and being\\ngrown weary of a surgeon’s employment at sea, which, however, I could\\nexercise upon occasion, I took a skilful young man of that calling, one\\nRobert Purefoy, into my ship. We set sail from Portsmouth upon the 7th\\nday of August, 1710; on the 14th we met with Captain Pocock, of\\nBristol, at Teneriffe, who was going to the bay of Campechy to cut\\nlogwood. On the 16th, he was parted from us by a storm; I heard since\\nmy return, that his ship foundered, and none escaped but one cabin boy.\\nHe was an honest man, and a good sailor, but a little too positive in\\nhis own opinions, which was the cause of his destruction, as it has\\nbeen with several others; for if he had followed my advice, he might\\nhave been safe at home with his family at this time, as well as myself.\\n\\nI had several men who died in my ship of calentures, so that I was\\nforced to get recruits out of Barbadoes and the Leeward Islands, where\\nI touched, by the direction of the merchants who employed me; which I\\nhad soon too much cause to repent: for I found afterwards, that most of\\nthem had been buccaneers. I had fifty hands on board; and my orders\\nwere, that I should trade with the Indians in the South-Sea, and make\\nwhat discoveries I could. These rogues, whom I had picked up, debauched\\nmy other men, and they all formed a conspiracy to seize the ship, and\\nsecure me; which they did one morning, rushing into my cabin, and\\nbinding me hand and foot, threatening to throw me overboard, if I\\noffered to stir. I told them, “I was their prisoner, and would submit.”\\nThis they made me swear to do, and then they unbound me, only fastening\\none of my legs with a chain, near my bed, and placed a sentry at my\\ndoor with his piece charged, who was commanded to shoot me dead if I\\nattempted my liberty. They sent me down victuals and drink, and took\\nthe government of the ship to themselves. Their design was to turn\\npirates, and plunder the Spaniards, which they could not do till they\\ngot more men. But first they resolved to sell the goods in the ship,\\nand then go to Madagascar for recruits, several among them having died\\nsince my confinement. They sailed many weeks, and traded with the\\nIndians; but I knew not what course they took, being kept a close\\nprisoner in my cabin, and expecting nothing less than to be murdered,\\nas they often threatened me.\\n\\nUpon the 9th day of May, 1711, one James Welch came down to my cabin,\\nand said, “he had orders from the captain to set me ashore.” I\\nexpostulated with him, but in vain; neither would he so much as tell me\\nwho their new captain was. They forced me into the long-boat, letting\\nme put on my best suit of clothes, which were as good as new, and take\\na small bundle of linen, but no arms, except my hanger; and they were\\nso civil as not to search my pockets, into which I conveyed what money\\nI had, with some other little necessaries. They rowed about a league,\\nand then set me down on a strand. I desired them to tell me what\\ncountry it was. They all swore, “they knew no more than myself;” but\\nsaid, “that the captain” (as they called him) “was resolved, after they\\nhad sold the lading, to get rid of me in the first place where they\\ncould discover land.” They pushed off immediately, advising me to make\\nhaste for fear of being overtaken by the tide, and so bade me farewell.\\n\\nIn this desolate condition I advanced forward, and soon got upon firm\\nground, where I sat down on a bank to rest myself, and consider what I\\nhad best do. When I was a little refreshed, I went up into the country,\\nresolving to deliver myself to the first savages I should meet, and\\npurchase my life from them by some bracelets, glass rings, and other\\ntoys, which sailors usually provide themselves with in those voyages,\\nand whereof I had some about me. The land was divided by long rows of\\ntrees, not regularly planted, but naturally growing; there was great\\nplenty of grass, and several fields of oats. I walked very\\ncircumspectly, for fear of being surprised, or suddenly shot with an\\narrow from behind, or on either side. I fell into a beaten road, where\\nI saw many tracts of human feet, and some of cows, but most of horses.\\nAt last I beheld several animals in a field, and one or two of the same\\nkind sitting in trees. Their shape was very singular and deformed,\\nwhich a little discomposed me, so that I lay down behind a thicket to\\nobserve them better. Some of them coming forward near the place where I\\nlay, gave me an opportunity of distinctly marking their form. Their\\nheads and breasts were covered with a thick hair, some frizzled, and\\nothers lank; they had beards like goats, and a long ridge of hair down\\ntheir backs, and the fore parts of their legs and feet; but the rest of\\ntheir bodies was bare, so that I might see their skins, which were of a\\nbrown buff colour. They had no tails, nor any hair at all on their\\nbuttocks, except about the anus, which, I presume, nature had placed\\nthere to defend them as they sat on the ground, for this posture they\\nused, as well as lying down, and often stood on their hind feet. They\\nclimbed high trees as nimbly as a squirrel, for they had strong\\nextended claws before and behind, terminating in sharp points, and\\nhooked. They would often spring, and bound, and leap, with prodigious\\nagility. The females were not so large as the males; they had long lank\\nhair on their heads, but none on their faces, nor any thing more than a\\nsort of down on the rest of their bodies, except about the anus and\\npudenda. The dugs hung between their forefeet, and often reached almost\\nto the ground as they walked. The hair of both sexes was of several\\ncolours, brown, red, black, and yellow. Upon the whole, I never beheld,\\nin all my travels, so disagreeable an animal, or one against which I\\nnaturally conceived so strong an antipathy. So that, thinking I had\\nseen enough, full of contempt and aversion, I got up, and pursued the\\nbeaten road, hoping it might direct me to the cabin of some Indian. I\\nhad not got far, when I met one of these creatures full in my way, and\\ncoming up directly to me. The ugly monster, when he saw me, distorted\\nseveral ways, every feature of his visage, and stared, as at an object\\nhe had never seen before; then approaching nearer, lifted up his\\nfore-paw, whether out of curiosity or mischief I could not tell; but I\\ndrew my hanger, and gave him a good blow with the flat side of it, for\\nI durst not strike with the edge, fearing the inhabitants might be\\nprovoked against me, if they should come to know that I had killed or\\nmaimed any of their cattle. When the beast felt the smart, he drew\\nback, and roared so loud, that a herd of at least forty came flocking\\nabout me from the next field, howling and making odious faces; but I\\nran to the body of a tree, and leaning my back against it, kept them\\noff by waving my hanger. Several of this cursed brood, getting hold of\\nthe branches behind, leaped up into the tree, whence they began to\\ndischarge their excrements on my head; however, I escaped pretty well\\nby sticking close to the stem of the tree, but was almost stifled with\\nthe filth, which fell about me on every side.\\n\\nIn the midst of this distress, I observed them all to run away on a\\nsudden as fast as they could; at which I ventured to leave the tree and\\npursue the road, wondering what it was that could put them into this\\nfright. But looking on my left hand, I saw a horse walking softly in\\nthe field; which my persecutors having sooner discovered, was the cause\\nof their flight. The horse started a little, when he came near me, but\\nsoon recovering himself, looked full in my face with manifest tokens of\\nwonder; he viewed my hands and feet, walking round me several times. I\\nwould have pursued my journey, but he placed himself directly in the\\nway, yet looking with a very mild aspect, never offering the least\\nviolence. We stood gazing at each other for some time; at last I took\\nthe boldness to reach my hand towards his neck with a design to stroke\\nit, using the common style and whistle of jockeys, when they are going\\nto handle a strange horse. But this animal seemed to receive my\\ncivilities with disdain, shook his head, and bent his brows, softly\\nraising up his right fore-foot to remove my hand. Then he neighed three\\nor four times, but in so different a cadence, that I almost began to\\nthink he was speaking to himself, in some language of his own.\\n\\nWhile he and I were thus employed, another horse came up; who applying\\nhimself to the first in a very formal manner, they gently struck each\\nother’s right hoof before, neighing several times by turns, and varying\\nthe sound, which seemed to be almost articulate. They went some paces\\noff, as if it were to confer together, walking side by side, backward\\nand forward, like persons deliberating upon some affair of weight, but\\noften turning their eyes towards me, as it were to watch that I might\\nnot escape. I was amazed to see such actions and behaviour in brute\\nbeasts; and concluded with myself, that if the inhabitants of this\\ncountry were endued with a proportionable degree of reason, they must\\nneeds be the wisest people upon earth. This thought gave me so much\\ncomfort, that I resolved to go forward, until I could discover some\\nhouse or village, or meet with any of the natives, leaving the two\\nhorses to discourse together as they pleased. But the first, who was a\\ndapple gray, observing me to steal off, neighed after me in so\\nexpressive a tone, that I fancied myself to understand what he meant;\\nwhereupon I turned back, and came near to him to expect his farther\\ncommands: but concealing my fear as much as I could, for I began to be\\nin some pain how this adventure might terminate; and the reader will\\neasily believe I did not much like my present situation.\\n\\nThe two horses came up close to me, looking with great earnestness upon\\nmy face and hands. The gray steed rubbed my hat all round with his\\nright fore-hoof, and discomposed it so much that I was forced to adjust\\nit better by taking it off and settling it again; whereat, both he and\\nhis companion (who was a brown bay) appeared to be much surprised: the\\nlatter felt the lappet of my coat, and finding it to hang loose about\\nme, they both looked with new signs of wonder. He stroked my right\\nhand, seeming to admire the softness and colour; but he squeezed it so\\nhard between his hoof and his pastern, that I was forced to roar; after\\nwhich they both touched me with all possible tenderness. They were\\nunder great perplexity about my shoes and stockings, which they felt\\nvery often, neighing to each other, and using various gestures, not\\nunlike those of a philosopher, when he would attempt to solve some new\\nand difficult phenomenon.\\n\\nUpon the whole, the behaviour of these animals was so orderly and\\nrational, so acute and judicious, that I at last concluded they must\\nneeds be magicians, who had thus metamorphosed themselves upon some\\ndesign, and seeing a stranger in the way, resolved to divert themselves\\nwith him; or, perhaps, were really amazed at the sight of a man so very\\ndifferent in habit, feature, and complexion, from those who might\\nprobably live in so remote a climate. Upon the strength of this\\nreasoning, I ventured to address them in the following manner:\\n“Gentlemen, if you be conjurers, as I have good cause to believe, you\\ncan understand my language; therefore I make bold to let your worships\\nknow that I am a poor distressed Englishman, driven by his misfortunes\\nupon your coast; and I entreat one of you to let me ride upon his back,\\nas if he were a real horse, to some house or village where I can be\\nrelieved. In return of which favour, I will make you a present of this\\nknife and bracelet,” taking them out of my pocket. The two creatures\\nstood silent while I spoke, seeming to listen with great attention, and\\nwhen I had ended, they neighed frequently towards each other, as if\\nthey were engaged in serious conversation. I plainly observed that\\ntheir language expressed the passions very well, and the words might,\\nwith little pains, be resolved into an alphabet more easily than the\\nChinese.\\n\\nI could frequently distinguish the word _Yahoo_, which was repeated by\\neach of them several times: and although it was impossible for me to\\nconjecture what it meant, yet while the two horses were busy in\\nconversation, I endeavoured to practise this word upon my tongue; and\\nas soon as they were silent, I boldly pronounced _Yahoo_ in a loud\\nvoice, imitating at the same time, as near as I could, the neighing of\\na horse; at which they were both visibly surprised; and the gray\\nrepeated the same word twice, as if he meant to teach me the right\\naccent; wherein I spoke after him as well as I could, and found myself\\nperceivably to improve every time, though very far from any degree of\\nperfection. Then the bay tried me with a second word, much harder to be\\npronounced; but reducing it to the English orthography, may be spelt\\nthus, _Houyhnhnm_. I did not succeed in this so well as in the former;\\nbut after two or three farther trials, I had better fortune; and they\\nboth appeared amazed at my capacity.\\n\\nAfter some further discourse, which I then conjectured might relate to\\nme, the two friends took their leaves, with the same compliment of\\nstriking each other’s hoof; and the gray made me signs that I should\\nwalk before him; wherein I thought it prudent to comply, till I could\\nfind a better director. When I offered to slacken my pace, he would cry\\n_hhuun hhuun_: I guessed his meaning, and gave him to understand, as\\nwell as I could, “that I was weary, and not able to walk faster;” upon\\nwhich he would stand a while to let me rest.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\nThe author conducted by a Houyhnhnm to his house. The house described.\\nThe author’s reception. The food of the Houyhnhnms. The author in\\ndistress for want of meat, is at last relieved. His manner of feeding\\nin this country.\\n\\n\\nHaving travelled about three miles, we came to a long kind of building,\\nmade of timber stuck in the ground, and wattled across; the roof was\\nlow and covered with straw. I now began to be a little comforted; and\\ntook out some toys, which travellers usually carry for presents to the\\nsavage Indians of America, and other parts, in hopes the people of the\\nhouse would be thereby encouraged to receive me kindly. The horse made\\nme a sign to go in first; it was a large room with a smooth clay floor,\\nand a rack and manger, extending the whole length on one side. There\\nwere three nags and two mares, not eating, but some of them sitting\\ndown upon their hams, which I very much wondered at; but wondered more\\nto see the rest employed in domestic business; these seemed but\\nordinary cattle. However, this confirmed my first opinion, that a\\npeople who could so far civilize brute animals, must needs excel in\\nwisdom all the nations of the world. The gray came in just after, and\\nthereby prevented any ill treatment which the others might have given\\nme. He neighed to them several times in a style of authority, and\\nreceived answers.\\n\\nBeyond this room there were three others, reaching the length of the\\nhouse, to which you passed through three doors, opposite to each other,\\nin the manner of a vista. We went through the second room towards the\\nthird. Here the gray walked in first, beckoning me to attend: I waited\\nin the second room, and got ready my presents for the master and\\nmistress of the house; they were two knives, three bracelets of false\\npearls, a small looking-glass, and a bead necklace. The horse neighed\\nthree or four times, and I waited to hear some answers in a human\\nvoice, but I heard no other returns than in the same dialect, only one\\nor two a little shriller than his. I began to think that this house\\nmust belong to some person of great note among them, because there\\nappeared so much ceremony before I could gain admittance. But, that a\\nman of quality should be served all by horses, was beyond my\\ncomprehension. I feared my brain was disturbed by my sufferings and\\nmisfortunes. I roused myself, and looked about me in the room where I\\nwas left alone: this was furnished like the first, only after a more\\nelegant manner. I rubbed my eyes often, but the same objects still\\noccurred. I pinched my arms and sides to awake myself, hoping I might\\nbe in a dream. I then absolutely concluded, that all these appearances\\ncould be nothing else but necromancy and magic. But I had no time to\\npursue these reflections; for the gray horse came to the door, and made\\nme a sign to follow him into the third room where I saw a very comely\\nmare, together with a colt and foal, sitting on their haunches upon\\nmats of straw, not unartfully made, and perfectly neat and clean.\\n\\nThe mare soon after my entrance rose from her mat, and coming up close,\\nafter having nicely observed my hands and face, gave me a most\\ncontemptuous look; and turning to the horse, I heard the word _Yahoo_\\noften repeated betwixt them; the meaning of which word I could not then\\ncomprehend, although it was the first I had learned to pronounce. But I\\nwas soon better informed, to my everlasting mortification; for the\\nhorse, beckoning to me with his head, and repeating the _hhuun_,\\n_hhuun_, as he did upon the road, which I understood was to attend him,\\nled me out into a kind of court, where was another building, at some\\ndistance from the house. Here we entered, and I saw three of those\\ndetestable creatures, which I first met after my landing, feeding upon\\nroots, and the flesh of some animals, which I afterwards found to be\\nthat of asses and dogs, and now and then a cow, dead by accident or\\ndisease. They were all tied by the neck with strong withes, fastened to\\na beam; they held their food between the claws of their forefeet, and\\ntore it with their teeth.\\n\\nThe master horse ordered a sorrel nag, one of his servants, to untie\\nthe largest of these animals, and take him into the yard. The beast and\\nI were brought close together, and by our countenances diligently\\ncompared both by master and servant, who thereupon repeated several\\ntimes the word _Yahoo_. My horror and astonishment are not to be\\ndescribed, when I observed in this abominable animal, a perfect human\\nfigure: the face of it indeed was flat and broad, the nose depressed,\\nthe lips large, and the mouth wide; but these differences are common to\\nall savage nations, where the lineaments of the countenance are\\ndistorted, by the natives suffering their infants to lie grovelling on\\nthe earth, or by carrying them on their backs, nuzzling with their face\\nagainst the mothers’ shoulders. The forefeet of the _Yahoo_ differed\\nfrom my hands in nothing else but the length of the nails, the\\ncoarseness and brownness of the palms, and the hairiness on the backs.\\nThere was the same resemblance between our feet, with the same\\ndifferences; which I knew very well, though the horses did not, because\\nof my shoes and stockings; the same in every part of our bodies except\\nas to hairiness and colour, which I have already described.\\n\\nThe great difficulty that seemed to stick with the two horses, was to\\nsee the rest of my body so very different from that of a _Yahoo_, for\\nwhich I was obliged to my clothes, whereof they had no conception. The\\nsorrel nag offered me a root, which he held (after their manner, as we\\nshall describe in its proper place) between his hoof and pastern; I\\ntook it in my hand, and, having smelt it, returned it to him again as\\ncivilly as I could. He brought out of the _Yahoos_’ kennel a piece of\\nass’s flesh; but it smelt so offensively that I turned from it with\\nloathing: he then threw it to the _Yahoo_, by whom it was greedily\\ndevoured. He afterwards showed me a wisp of hay, and a fetlock full of\\noats; but I shook my head, to signify that neither of these were food\\nfor me. And indeed I now apprehended that I must absolutely starve, if\\nI did not get to some of my own species; for as to those filthy\\n_Yahoos_, although there were few greater lovers of mankind at that\\ntime than myself, yet I confess I never saw any sensitive being so\\ndetestable on all accounts; and the more I came near them the more\\nhateful they grew, while I stayed in that country. This the master\\nhorse observed by my behaviour, and therefore sent the _Yahoo_ back to\\nhis kennel. He then put his fore-hoof to his mouth, at which I was much\\nsurprised, although he did it with ease, and with a motion that\\nappeared perfectly natural, and made other signs, to know what I would\\neat; but I could not return him such an answer as he was able to\\napprehend; and if he had understood me, I did not see how it was\\npossible to contrive any way for finding myself nourishment. While we\\nwere thus engaged, I observed a cow passing by, whereupon I pointed to\\nher, and expressed a desire to go and milk her. This had its effect;\\nfor he led me back into the house, and ordered a mare-servant to open a\\nroom, where a good store of milk lay in earthen and wooden vessels,\\nafter a very orderly and cleanly manner. She gave me a large bowlful,\\nof which I drank very heartily, and found myself well refreshed.\\n\\nAbout noon, I saw coming towards the house a kind of vehicle drawn like\\na sledge by four _Yahoos_. There was in it an old steed, who seemed to\\nbe of quality; he alighted with his hind-feet forward, having by\\naccident got a hurt in his left fore-foot. He came to dine with our\\nhorse, who received him with great civility. They dined in the best\\nroom, and had oats boiled in milk for the second course, which the old\\nhorse ate warm, but the rest cold. Their mangers were placed circular\\nin the middle of the room, and divided into several partitions, round\\nwhich they sat on their haunches, upon bosses of straw. In the middle\\nwas a large rack, with angles answering to every partition of the\\nmanger; so that each horse and mare ate their own hay, and their own\\nmash of oats and milk, with much decency and regularity. The behaviour\\nof the young colt and foal appeared very modest, and that of the master\\nand mistress extremely cheerful and complaisant to their guest. The\\ngray ordered me to stand by him; and much discourse passed between him\\nand his friend concerning me, as I found by the stranger’s often\\nlooking on me, and the frequent repetition of the word _Yahoo_.\\n\\nI happened to wear my gloves, which the master gray observing, seemed\\nperplexed, discovering signs of wonder what I had done to my forefeet.\\nHe put his hoof three or four times to them, as if he would signify,\\nthat I should reduce them to their former shape, which I presently did,\\npulling off both my gloves, and putting them into my pocket. This\\noccasioned farther talk; and I saw the company was pleased with my\\nbehaviour, whereof I soon found the good effects. I was ordered to\\nspeak the few words I understood; and while they were at dinner, the\\nmaster taught me the names for oats, milk, fire, water, and some\\nothers, which I could readily pronounce after him, having from my youth\\na great facility in learning languages.\\n\\nWhen dinner was done, the master horse took me aside, and by signs and\\nwords made me understand the concern he was in that I had nothing to\\neat. Oats in their tongue are called _hlunnh_. This word I pronounced\\ntwo or three times; for although I had refused them at first, yet, upon\\nsecond thoughts, I considered that I could contrive to make of them a\\nkind of bread, which might be sufficient, with milk, to keep me alive,\\ntill I could make my escape to some other country, and to creatures of\\nmy own species. The horse immediately ordered a white mare servant of\\nhis family to bring me a good quantity of oats in a sort of wooden\\ntray. These I heated before the fire, as well as I could, and rubbed\\nthem till the husks came off, which I made a shift to winnow from the\\ngrain. I ground and beat them between two stones; then took water, and\\nmade them into a paste or cake, which I toasted at the fire and eat\\nwarm with milk. It was at first a very insipid diet, though common\\nenough in many parts of Europe, but grew tolerable by time; and having\\nbeen often reduced to hard fare in my life, this was not the first\\nexperiment I had made how easily nature is satisfied. And I cannot but\\nobserve, that I never had one hour’s sickness while I stayed in this\\nisland. It is true, I sometimes made a shift to catch a rabbit, or\\nbird, by springs made of _Yahoo’s_ hairs; and I often gathered\\nwholesome herbs, which I boiled, and ate as salads with my bread; and\\nnow and then, for a rarity, I made a little butter, and drank the whey.\\nI was at first at a great loss for salt, but custom soon reconciled me\\nto the want of it; and I am confident that the frequent use of salt\\namong us is an effect of luxury, and was first introduced only as a\\nprovocative to drink, except where it is necessary for preserving flesh\\nin long voyages, or in places remote from great markets; for we observe\\nno animal to be fond of it but man, and as to myself, when I left this\\ncountry, it was a great while before I could endure the taste of it in\\nanything that I ate.\\n\\nThis is enough to say upon the subject of my diet, wherewith other\\ntravellers fill their books, as if the readers were personally\\nconcerned whether we fare well or ill. However, it was necessary to\\nmention this matter, lest the world should think it impossible that I\\ncould find sustenance for three years in such a country, and among such\\ninhabitants.\\n\\nWhen it grew towards evening, the master horse ordered a place for me\\nto lodge in; it was but six yards from the house and separated from the\\nstable of the _Yahoos_. Here I got some straw, and covering myself with\\nmy own clothes, slept very sound. But I was in a short time better\\naccommodated, as the reader shall know hereafter, when I come to treat\\nmore particularly about my way of living.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\nThe author studies to learn the language. The Houyhnhnm, his master,\\nassists in teaching him. The language described. Several Houyhnhnms of\\nquality come out of curiosity to see the author. He gives his master a\\nshort account of his voyage.\\n\\n\\nMy principal endeavour was to learn the language, which my master (for\\nso I shall henceforth call him), and his children, and every servant of\\nhis house, were desirous to teach me; for they looked upon it as a\\nprodigy, that a brute animal should discover such marks of a rational\\ncreature. I pointed to every thing, and inquired the name of it, which\\nI wrote down in my journal-book when I was alone, and corrected my bad\\naccent by desiring those of the family to pronounce it often. In this\\nemployment, a sorrel nag, one of the under-servants, was very ready to\\nassist me.\\n\\nIn speaking, they pronounced through the nose and throat, and their\\nlanguage approaches nearest to the High-Dutch, or German, of any I know\\nin Europe; but is much more graceful and significant. The emperor\\nCharles V. made almost the same observation, when he said “that if he\\nwere to speak to his horse, it should be in High-Dutch.”\\n\\nThe curiosity and impatience of my master were so great, that he spent\\nmany hours of his leisure to instruct me. He was convinced (as he\\nafterwards told me) that I must be a _Yahoo_; but my teachableness,\\ncivility, and cleanliness, astonished him; which were qualities\\naltogether opposite to those animals. He was most perplexed about my\\nclothes, reasoning sometimes with himself, whether they were a part of\\nmy body: for I never pulled them off till the family were asleep, and\\ngot them on before they waked in the morning. My master was eager to\\nlearn “whence I came; how I acquired those appearances of reason, which\\nI discovered in all my actions; and to know my story from my own mouth,\\nwhich he hoped he should soon do by the great proficiency I made in\\nlearning and pronouncing their words and sentences.” To help my memory,\\nI formed all I learned into the English alphabet, and writ the words\\ndown, with the translations. This last, after some time, I ventured to\\ndo in my master’s presence. It cost me much trouble to explain to him\\nwhat I was doing; for the inhabitants have not the least idea of books\\nor literature.\\n\\nIn about ten weeks time, I was able to understand most of his\\nquestions; and in three months, could give him some tolerable answers.\\nHe was extremely curious to know “from what part of the country I came,\\nand how I was taught to imitate a rational creature; because the\\n_Yahoos_ (whom he saw I exactly resembled in my head, hands, and face,\\nthat were only visible), with some appearance of cunning, and the\\nstrongest disposition to mischief, were observed to be the most\\nunteachable of all brutes.” I answered, “that I came over the sea, from\\na far place, with many others of my own kind, in a great hollow vessel\\nmade of the bodies of trees: that my companions forced me to land on\\nthis coast, and then left me to shift for myself.” It was with some\\ndifficulty, and by the help of many signs, that I brought him to\\nunderstand me. He replied, “that I must needs be mistaken, or that I\\nsaid the thing which was not;” for they have no word in their language\\nto express lying or falsehood. “He knew it was impossible that there\\ncould be a country beyond the sea, or that a parcel of brutes could\\nmove a wooden vessel whither they pleased upon water. He was sure no\\n_Houyhnhnm_ alive could make such a vessel, nor would trust _Yahoos_ to\\nmanage it.”\\n\\nThe word _Houyhnhnm_, in their tongue, signifies a _horse_, and, in its\\netymology, the _perfection of nature_. I told my master, “that I was at\\na loss for expression, but would improve as fast as I could; and hoped,\\nin a short time, I should be able to tell him wonders.” He was pleased\\nto direct his own mare, his colt, and foal, and the servants of the\\nfamily, to take all opportunities of instructing me; and every day, for\\ntwo or three hours, he was at the same pains himself. Several horses\\nand mares of quality in the neighbourhood came often to our house, upon\\nthe report spread of “a wonderful _Yahoo_, that could speak like a\\n_Houyhnhnm_, and seemed, in his words and actions, to discover some\\nglimmerings of reason.” These delighted to converse with me: they put\\nmany questions, and received such answers as I was able to return. By\\nall these advantages I made so great a progress, that, in five months\\nfrom my arrival I understood whatever was spoken, and could express\\nmyself tolerably well.\\n\\nThe _Houyhnhnms_, who came to visit my master out of a design of seeing\\nand talking with me, could hardly believe me to be a right _Yahoo_,\\nbecause my body had a different covering from others of my kind. They\\nwere astonished to observe me without the usual hair or skin, except on\\nmy head, face, and hands; but I discovered that secret to my master\\nupon an accident which happened about a fortnight before.\\n\\nI have already told the reader, that every night, when the family were\\ngone to bed, it was my custom to strip, and cover myself with my\\nclothes. It happened, one morning early, that my master sent for me by\\nthe sorrel nag, who was his valet. When he came I was fast asleep, my\\nclothes fallen off on one side, and my shirt above my waist. I awaked\\nat the noise he made, and observed him to deliver his message in some\\ndisorder; after which he went to my master, and in a great fright gave\\nhim a very confused account of what he had seen. This I presently\\ndiscovered, for, going as soon as I was dressed to pay my attendance\\nupon his honour, he asked me “the meaning of what his servant had\\nreported, that I was not the same thing when I slept, as I appeared to\\nbe at other times; that his valet assured him, some part of me was\\nwhite, some yellow, at least not so white, and some brown.”\\n\\nI had hitherto concealed the secret of my dress, in order to\\ndistinguish myself, as much as possible, from that cursed race of\\n_Yahoos_; but now I found it in vain to do so any longer. Besides, I\\nconsidered that my clothes and shoes would soon wear out, which already\\nwere in a declining condition, and must be supplied by some contrivance\\nfrom the hides of _Yahoos_, or other brutes; whereby the whole secret\\nwould be known. I therefore told my master, “that in the country whence\\nI came, those of my kind always covered their bodies with the hairs of\\ncertain animals prepared by art, as well for decency as to avoid the\\ninclemencies of air, both hot and cold; of which, as to my own person,\\nI would give him immediate conviction, if he pleased to command me:\\nonly desiring his excuse, if I did not expose those parts that nature\\ntaught us to conceal.” He said, “my discourse was all very strange, but\\nespecially the last part; for he could not understand, why nature\\nshould teach us to conceal what nature had given; that neither himself\\nnor family were ashamed of any parts of their bodies; but, however, I\\nmight do as I pleased.” Whereupon I first unbuttoned my coat, and\\npulled it off. I did the same with my waistcoat. I drew off my shoes,\\nstockings, and breeches. I let my shirt down to my waist, and drew up\\nthe bottom; fastening it like a girdle about my middle, to hide my\\nnakedness.\\n\\nMy master observed the whole performance with great signs of curiosity\\nand admiration. He took up all my clothes in his pastern, one piece\\nafter another, and examined them diligently; he then stroked my body\\nvery gently, and looked round me several times; after which, he said,\\nit was plain I must be a perfect _Yahoo_; but that I differed very much\\nfrom the rest of my species in the softness, whiteness, and smoothness\\nof my skin; my want of hair in several parts of my body; the shape and\\nshortness of my claws behind and before; and my affectation of walking\\ncontinually on my two hinder feet. He desired to see no more; and gave\\nme leave to put on my clothes again, for I was shuddering with cold.\\n\\nI expressed my uneasiness at his giving me so often the appellation of\\n_Yahoo_, an odious animal, for which I had so utter a hatred and\\ncontempt: I begged he would forbear applying that word to me, and make\\nthe same order in his family and among his friends whom he suffered to\\nsee me. I requested likewise, “that the secret of my having a false\\ncovering to my body, might be known to none but himself, at least as\\nlong as my present clothing should last; for as to what the sorrel nag,\\nhis valet, had observed, his honour might command him to conceal it.”\\n\\nAll this my master very graciously consented to; and thus the secret\\nwas kept till my clothes began to wear out, which I was forced to\\nsupply by several contrivances that shall hereafter be mentioned. In\\nthe meantime, he desired “I would go on with my utmost diligence to\\nlearn their language, because he was more astonished at my capacity for\\nspeech and reason, than at the figure of my body, whether it were\\ncovered or not;” adding, “that he waited with some impatience to hear\\nthe wonders which I promised to tell him.”\\n\\nFrom thenceforward he doubled the pains he had been at to instruct me:\\nhe brought me into all company, and made them treat me with civility;\\n“because,” as he told them, privately, “this would put me into good\\nhumour, and make me more diverting.”\\n\\nEvery day, when I waited on him, beside the trouble he was at in\\nteaching, he would ask me several questions concerning myself, which I\\nanswered as well as I could, and by these means he had already received\\nsome general ideas, though very imperfect. It would be tedious to\\nrelate the several steps by which I advanced to a more regular\\nconversation; but the first account I gave of myself in any order and\\nlength was to this purpose:\\n\\n“That I came from a very far country, as I already had attempted to\\ntell him, with about fifty more of my own species; that we travelled\\nupon the seas in a great hollow vessel made of wood, and larger than\\nhis honour’s house. I described the ship to him in the best terms I\\ncould, and explained, by the help of my handkerchief displayed, how it\\nwas driven forward by the wind. That upon a quarrel among us, I was set\\non shore on this coast, where I walked forward, without knowing\\nwhither, till he delivered me from the persecution of those execrable\\n_Yahoos_.” He asked me, “who made the ship, and how it was possible\\nthat the _Houyhnhnms_ of my country would leave it to the management of\\nbrutes?” My answer was, “that I durst proceed no further in my\\nrelation, unless he would give me his word and honour that he would not\\nbe offended, and then I would tell him the wonders I had so often\\npromised.” He agreed; and I went on by assuring him, that the ship was\\nmade by creatures like myself; who, in all the countries I had\\ntravelled, as well as in my own, were the only governing rational\\nanimals; and that upon my arrival hither, I was as much astonished to\\nsee the _Houyhnhnms_ act like rational beings, as he, or his friends,\\ncould be, in finding some marks of reason in a creature he was pleased\\nto call a _Yahoo_; to which I owned my resemblance in every part, but\\ncould not account for their degenerate and brutal nature. I said\\nfarther, “that if good fortune ever restored me to my native country,\\nto relate my travels hither, as I resolved to do, everybody would\\nbelieve, that I said the thing that was not, that I invented the story\\nout of my own head; and (with all possible respect to himself, his\\nfamily, and friends, and under his promise of not being offended) our\\ncountrymen would hardly think it probable that a _Houyhnhnm_ should be\\nthe presiding creature of a nation, and a _Yahoo_ the brute.”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\nThe Houyhnhnms’ notion of truth and falsehood. The author’s discourse\\ndisapproved by his master. The author gives a more particular account\\nof himself, and the accidents of his voyage.\\n\\n\\nMy master heard me with great appearances of uneasiness in his\\ncountenance; because _doubting_, or not believing, are so little known\\nin this country, that the inhabitants cannot tell how to behave\\nthemselves under such circumstances. And I remember, in frequent\\ndiscourses with my master concerning the nature of manhood in other\\nparts of the world, having occasion to talk of _lying_ and _false\\nrepresentation_, it was with much difficulty that he comprehended what\\nI meant, although he had otherwise a most acute judgment. For he argued\\nthus: “that the use of speech was to make us understand one another,\\nand to receive information of facts; now, if any one _said the thing\\nwhich was not_, these ends were defeated, because I cannot properly be\\nsaid to understand him; and I am so far from receiving information,\\nthat he leaves me worse than in ignorance; for I am led to believe a\\nthing black, when it is white, and short, when it is long.” And these\\nwere all the notions he had concerning that faculty of _lying_, so\\nperfectly well understood, and so universally practised, among human\\ncreatures.\\n\\nTo return from this digression. When I asserted that the _Yahoos_ were\\nthe only governing animals in my country, which my master said was\\naltogether past his conception, he desired to know, “whether we had\\n_Houyhnhnms_ among us, and what was their employment?” I told him, “we\\nhad great numbers; that in summer they grazed in the fields, and in\\nwinter were kept in houses with hay and oats, where _Yahoo_ servants\\nwere employed to rub their skins smooth, comb their manes, pick their\\nfeet, serve them with food, and make their beds.” “I understand you\\nwell,” said my master: “it is now very plain, from all you have spoken,\\nthat whatever share of reason the _Yahoos_ pretend to, the _Houyhnhnms_\\nare your masters; I heartily wish our _Yahoos_ would be so tractable.”\\nI begged “his honour would please to excuse me from proceeding any\\nfurther, because I was very certain that the account he expected from\\nme would be highly displeasing.” But he insisted in commanding me to\\nlet him know the best and the worst. I told him “he should be obeyed.”\\nI owned “that the _Houyhnhnms_ among us, whom we called horses, were\\nthe most generous and comely animals we had; that they excelled in\\nstrength and swiftness; and when they belonged to persons of quality,\\nwere employed in travelling, racing, or drawing chariots; they were\\ntreated with much kindness and care, till they fell into diseases, or\\nbecame foundered in the feet; but then they were sold, and used to all\\nkind of drudgery till they died; after which their skins were stripped,\\nand sold for what they were worth, and their bodies left to be devoured\\nby dogs and birds of prey. But the common race of horses had not so\\ngood fortune, being kept by farmers and carriers, and other mean\\npeople, who put them to greater labour, and fed them worse.” I\\ndescribed, as well as I could, our way of riding; the shape and use of\\na bridle, a saddle, a spur, and a whip; of harness and wheels. I added,\\n“that we fastened plates of a certain hard substance, called iron, at\\nthe bottom of their feet, to preserve their hoofs from being broken by\\nthe stony ways, on which we often travelled.”\\n\\nMy master, after some expressions of great indignation, wondered “how\\nwe dared to venture upon a _Houyhnhnm’s_ back; for he was sure, that\\nthe weakest servant in his house would be able to shake off the\\nstrongest _Yahoo_; or by lying down and rolling on his back, squeeze\\nthe brute to death.” I answered “that our horses were trained up, from\\nthree or four years old, to the several uses we intended them for; that\\nif any of them proved intolerably vicious, they were employed for\\ncarriages; that they were severely beaten, while they were young, for\\nany mischievous tricks; that the males, designed for the common use of\\nriding or draught, were generally castrated about two years after their\\nbirth, to take down their spirits, and make them more tame and gentle;\\nthat they were indeed sensible of rewards and punishments; but his\\nhonour would please to consider, that they had not the least tincture\\nof reason, any more than the _Yahoos_ in this country.”\\n\\nIt put me to the pains of many circumlocutions, to give my master a\\nright idea of what I spoke; for their language does not abound in\\nvariety of words, because their wants and passions are fewer than among\\nus. But it is impossible to express his noble resentment at our savage\\ntreatment of the _Houyhnhnm_ race; particularly after I had explained\\nthe manner and use of castrating horses among us, to hinder them from\\npropagating their kind, and to render them more servile. He said, “if\\nit were possible there could be any country where _Yahoos_ alone were\\nendued with reason, they certainly must be the governing animal;\\nbecause reason in time will always prevail against brutal strength.\\nBut, considering the frame of our bodies, and especially of mine, he\\nthought no creature of equal bulk was so ill-contrived for employing\\nthat reason in the common offices of life;” whereupon he desired to\\nknow “whether those among whom I lived resembled me, or the _Yahoos_ of\\nhis country?” I assured him, “that I was as well shaped as most of my\\nage; but the younger, and the females, were much more soft and tender,\\nand the skins of the latter generally as white as milk.” He said, “I\\ndiffered indeed from other _Yahoos_, being much more cleanly, and not\\naltogether so deformed; but, in point of real advantage, he thought I\\ndiffered for the worse: that my nails were of no use either to my fore\\nor hinder feet; as to my forefeet, he could not properly call them by\\nthat name, for he never observed me to walk upon them; that they were\\ntoo soft to bear the ground; that I generally went with them uncovered;\\nneither was the covering I sometimes wore on them of the same shape, or\\nso strong as that on my feet behind: that I could not walk with any\\nsecurity, for if either of my hinder feet slipped, I must inevitably\\nfall.” He then began to find fault with other parts of my body: “the\\nflatness of my face, the prominence of my nose, my eyes placed directly\\nin front, so that I could not look on either side without turning my\\nhead: that I was not able to feed myself, without lifting one of my\\nforefeet to my mouth: and therefore nature had placed those joints to\\nanswer that necessity. He knew not what could be the use of those\\nseveral clefts and divisions in my feet behind; that these were too\\nsoft to bear the hardness and sharpness of stones, without a covering\\nmade from the skin of some other brute; that my whole body wanted a\\nfence against heat and cold, which I was forced to put on and off every\\nday, with tediousness and trouble: and lastly, that he observed every\\nanimal in this country naturally to abhor the _Yahoos_, whom the weaker\\navoided, and the stronger drove from them. So that, supposing us to\\nhave the gift of reason, he could not see how it were possible to cure\\nthat natural antipathy, which every creature discovered against us; nor\\nconsequently how we could tame and render them serviceable. However, he\\nwould,” as he said, “debate the matter no farther, because he was more\\ndesirous to know my own story, the country where I was born, and the\\nseveral actions and events of my life, before I came hither.”\\n\\nI assured him, “how extremely desirous I was that he should be\\nsatisfied on every point; but I doubted much, whether it would be\\npossible for me to explain myself on several subjects, whereof his\\nhonour could have no conception; because I saw nothing in his country\\nto which I could resemble them; that, however, I would do my best, and\\nstrive to express myself by similitudes, humbly desiring his assistance\\nwhen I wanted proper words;” which he was pleased to promise me.\\n\\nI said, “my birth was of honest parents, in an island called England;\\nwhich was remote from his country, as many days’ journey as the\\nstrongest of his honour’s servants could travel in the annual course of\\nthe sun; that I was bred a surgeon, whose trade it is to cure wounds\\nand hurts in the body, gotten by accident or violence; that my country\\nwas governed by a female man, whom we called queen; that I left it to\\nget riches, whereby I might maintain myself and family, when I should\\nreturn; that, in my last voyage, I was commander of the ship, and had\\nabout fifty _Yahoos_ under me, many of which died at sea, and I was\\nforced to supply them by others picked out from several nations; that\\nour ship was twice in danger of being sunk, the first time by a great\\nstorm, and the second by striking against a rock.” Here my master\\ninterposed, by asking me, “how I could persuade strangers, out of\\ndifferent countries, to venture with me, after the losses I had\\nsustained, and the hazards I had run?” I said, “they were fellows of\\ndesperate fortunes, forced to fly from the places of their birth on\\naccount of their poverty or their crimes. Some were undone by lawsuits;\\nothers spent all they had in drinking, whoring, and gaming; others fled\\nfor treason; many for murder, theft, poisoning, robbery, perjury,\\nforgery, coining false money, for committing rapes, or sodomy; for\\nflying from their colours, or deserting to the enemy; and most of them\\nhad broken prison; none of these durst return to their native\\ncountries, for fear of being hanged, or of starving in a jail; and\\ntherefore they were under the necessity of seeking a livelihood in\\nother places.”\\n\\nDuring this discourse, my master was pleased to interrupt me several\\ntimes. I had made use of many circumlocutions in describing to him the\\nnature of the several crimes for which most of our crew had been forced\\nto fly their country. This labour took up several days’ conversation,\\nbefore he was able to comprehend me. He was wholly at a loss to know\\nwhat could be the use or necessity of practising those vices. To clear\\nup which, I endeavoured to give some ideas of the desire of power and\\nriches; of the terrible effects of lust, intemperance, malice, and\\nenvy. All this I was forced to define and describe by putting cases and\\nmaking suppositions. After which, like one whose imagination was struck\\nwith something never seen or heard of before, he would lift up his eyes\\nwith amazement and indignation. Power, government, war, law,\\npunishment, and a thousand other things, had no terms wherein that\\nlanguage could express them, which made the difficulty almost\\ninsuperable, to give my master any conception of what I meant. But\\nbeing of an excellent understanding, much improved by contemplation and\\nconverse, he at last arrived at a competent knowledge of what human\\nnature, in our parts of the world, is capable to perform, and desired I\\nwould give him some particular account of that land which we call\\nEurope, but especially of my own country.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\nThe author at his master’s command, informs him of the state of\\nEngland. The causes of war among the princes of Europe. The author\\nbegins to explain the English constitution.\\n\\n\\nThe reader may please to observe, that the following extract of many\\nconversations I had with my master, contains a summary of the most\\nmaterial points which were discoursed at several times for above two\\nyears; his honour often desiring fuller satisfaction, as I farther\\nimproved in the _Houyhnhnm_ tongue. I laid before him, as well as I\\ncould, the whole state of Europe; I discoursed of trade and\\nmanufactures, of arts and sciences; and the answers I gave to all the\\nquestions he made, as they arose upon several subjects, were a fund of\\nconversation not to be exhausted. But I shall here only set down the\\nsubstance of what passed between us concerning my own country, reducing\\nit in order as well as I can, without any regard to time or other\\ncircumstances, while I strictly adhere to truth. My only concern is,\\nthat I shall hardly be able to do justice to my master’s arguments and\\nexpressions, which must needs suffer by my want of capacity, as well as\\nby a translation into our barbarous English.\\n\\nIn obedience, therefore, to his honour’s commands, I related to him the\\nRevolution under the Prince of Orange; the long war with France,\\nentered into by the said prince, and renewed by his successor, the\\npresent queen, wherein the greatest powers of Christendom were engaged,\\nand which still continued: I computed, at his request, “that about a\\nmillion of _Yahoos_ might have been killed in the whole progress of it;\\nand perhaps a hundred or more cities taken, and five times as many\\nships burnt or sunk.”\\n\\nHe asked me, “what were the usual causes or motives that made one\\ncountry go to war with another?” I answered “they were innumerable; but\\nI should only mention a few of the chief. Sometimes the ambition of\\nprinces, who never think they have land or people enough to govern;\\nsometimes the corruption of ministers, who engage their master in a\\nwar, in order to stifle or divert the clamour of the subjects against\\ntheir evil administration. Difference in opinions has cost many\\nmillions of lives: for instance, whether flesh be bread, or bread be\\nflesh; whether the juice of a certain berry be blood or wine; whether\\nwhistling be a vice or a virtue; whether it be better to kiss a post,\\nor throw it into the fire; what is the best colour for a coat, whether\\nblack, white, red, or gray; and whether it should be long or short,\\nnarrow or wide, dirty or clean; with many more. Neither are any wars so\\nfurious and bloody, or of so long a continuance, as those occasioned by\\ndifference in opinion, especially if it be in things indifferent.\\n\\n“Sometimes the quarrel between two princes is to decide which of them\\nshall dispossess a third of his dominions, where neither of them\\npretend to any right. Sometimes one prince quarrels with another for\\nfear the other should quarrel with him. Sometimes a war is entered\\nupon, because the enemy is too strong; and sometimes, because he is too\\nweak. Sometimes our neighbours want the things which we have, or have\\nthe things which we want, and we both fight, till they take ours, or\\ngive us theirs. It is a very justifiable cause of a war, to invade a\\ncountry after the people have been wasted by famine, destroyed by\\npestilence, or embroiled by factions among themselves. It is\\njustifiable to enter into war against our nearest ally, when one of his\\ntowns lies convenient for us, or a territory of land, that would render\\nour dominions round and complete. If a prince sends forces into a\\nnation, where the people are poor and ignorant, he may lawfully put\\nhalf of them to death, and make slaves of the rest, in order to\\ncivilize and reduce them from their barbarous way of living. It is a\\nvery kingly, honourable, and frequent practice, when one prince desires\\nthe assistance of another, to secure him against an invasion, that the\\nassistant, when he has driven out the invader, should seize on the\\ndominions himself, and kill, imprison, or banish, the prince he came to\\nrelieve. Alliance by blood, or marriage, is a frequent cause of war\\nbetween princes; and the nearer the kindred is, the greater their\\ndisposition to quarrel; poor nations are hungry, and rich nations are\\nproud; and pride and hunger will ever be at variance. For these\\nreasons, the trade of a soldier is held the most honourable of all\\nothers; because a soldier is a _Yahoo_ hired to kill, in cold blood, as\\nmany of his own species, who have never offended him, as possibly he\\ncan.\\n\\n“There is likewise a kind of beggarly princes in Europe, not able to\\nmake war by themselves, who hire out their troops to richer nations,\\nfor so much a day to each man; of which they keep three-fourths to\\nthemselves, and it is the best part of their maintenance: such are\\nthose in many northern parts of Europe.”\\n\\n“What you have told me,” said my master, “upon the subject of war, does\\nindeed discover most admirably the effects of that reason you pretend\\nto: however, it is happy that the shame is greater than the danger; and\\nthat nature has left you utterly incapable of doing much mischief. For,\\nyour mouths lying flat with your faces, you can hardly bite each other\\nto any purpose, unless by consent. Then as to the claws upon your feet\\nbefore and behind, they are so short and tender, that one of our\\n_Yahoos_ would drive a dozen of yours before him. And therefore, in\\nrecounting the numbers of those who have been killed in battle, I\\ncannot but think you have said the thing which is not.”\\n\\nI could not forbear shaking my head, and smiling a little at his\\nignorance. And being no stranger to the art of war, I gave him a\\ndescription of cannons, culverins, muskets, carabines, pistols,\\nbullets, powder, swords, bayonets, battles, sieges, retreats, attacks,\\nundermines, countermines, bombardments, sea fights, ships sunk with a\\nthousand men, twenty thousand killed on each side, dying groans, limbs\\nflying in the air, smoke, noise, confusion, trampling to death under\\nhorses’ feet, flight, pursuit, victory; fields strewed with carcases,\\nleft for food to dogs and wolves and birds of prey; plundering,\\nstripping, ravishing, burning, and destroying. And to set forth the\\nvalour of my own dear countrymen, I assured him, “that I had seen them\\nblow up a hundred enemies at once in a siege, and as many in a ship,\\nand beheld the dead bodies drop down in pieces from the clouds, to the\\ngreat diversion of the spectators.”\\n\\nI was going on to more particulars, when my master commanded me\\nsilence. He said, “whoever understood the nature of _Yahoos_, might\\neasily believe it possible for so vile an animal to be capable of every\\naction I had named, if their strength and cunning equalled their\\nmalice. But as my discourse had increased his abhorrence of the whole\\nspecies, so he found it gave him a disturbance in his mind to which he\\nwas wholly a stranger before. He thought his ears, being used to such\\nabominable words, might, by degrees, admit them with less detestation:\\nthat although he hated the _Yahoos_ of this country, yet he no more\\nblamed them for their odious qualities, than he did a _gnnayh_ (a bird\\nof prey) for its cruelty, or a sharp stone for cutting his hoof. But\\nwhen a creature pretending to reason could be capable of such\\nenormities, he dreaded lest the corruption of that faculty might be\\nworse than brutality itself. He seemed therefore confident, that,\\ninstead of reason we were only possessed of some quality fitted to\\nincrease our natural vices; as the reflection from a troubled stream\\nreturns the image of an ill-shapen body, not only larger but more\\ndistorted.”\\n\\nHe added, “that he had heard too much upon the subject of war, both in\\nthis and some former discourses. There was another point, which a\\nlittle perplexed him at present. I had informed him, that some of our\\ncrew left their country on account of being ruined by law; that I had\\nalready explained the meaning of the word; but he was at a loss how it\\nshould come to pass, that the law, which was intended for every man’s\\npreservation, should be any man’s ruin. Therefore he desired to be\\nfurther satisfied what I meant by law, and the dispensers thereof,\\naccording to the present practice in my own country; because he thought\\nnature and reason were sufficient guides for a reasonable animal, as we\\npretended to be, in showing us what we ought to do, and what to avoid.”\\n\\nI assured his honour, “that law was a science in which I had not much\\nconversed, further than by employing advocates, in vain, upon some\\ninjustices that had been done me: however, I would give him all the\\nsatisfaction I was able.”\\n\\nI said, “there was a society of men among us, bred up from their youth\\nin the art of proving, by words multiplied for the purpose, that white\\nis black, and black is white, according as they are paid. To this\\nsociety all the rest of the people are slaves. For example, if my\\nneighbour has a mind to my cow, he has a lawyer to prove that he ought\\nto have my cow from me. I must then hire another to defend my right, it\\nbeing against all rules of law that any man should be allowed to speak\\nfor himself. Now, in this case, I, who am the right owner, lie under\\ntwo great disadvantages: first, my lawyer, being practised almost from\\nhis cradle in defending falsehood, is quite out of his element when he\\nwould be an advocate for justice, which is an unnatural office he\\nalways attempts with great awkwardness, if not with ill-will. The\\nsecond disadvantage is, that my lawyer must proceed with great caution,\\nor else he will be reprimanded by the judges, and abhorred by his\\nbrethren, as one that would lessen the practice of the law. And\\ntherefore I have but two methods to preserve my cow. The first is, to\\ngain over my adversary’s lawyer with a double fee, who will then betray\\nhis client by insinuating that he hath justice on his side. The second\\nway is for my lawyer to make my cause appear as unjust as he can, by\\nallowing the cow to belong to my adversary: and this, if it be\\nskilfully done, will certainly bespeak the favour of the bench. Now\\nyour honour is to know, that these judges are persons appointed to\\ndecide all controversies of property, as well as for the trial of\\ncriminals, and picked out from the most dexterous lawyers, who are\\ngrown old or lazy; and having been biassed all their lives against\\ntruth and equity, lie under such a fatal necessity of favouring fraud,\\nperjury, and oppression, that I have known some of them refuse a large\\nbribe from the side where justice lay, rather than injure the faculty,\\nby doing any thing unbecoming their nature or their office.\\n\\n“It is a maxim among these lawyers that whatever has been done before,\\nmay legally be done again: and therefore they take special care to\\nrecord all the decisions formerly made against common justice, and the\\ngeneral reason of mankind. These, under the name of precedents, they\\nproduce as authorities to justify the most iniquitous opinions; and the\\njudges never fail of directing accordingly.\\n\\n“In pleading, they studiously avoid entering into the merits of the\\ncause; but are loud, violent, and tedious, in dwelling upon all\\ncircumstances which are not to the purpose. For instance, in the case\\nalready mentioned; they never desire to know what claim or title my\\nadversary has to my cow; but whether the said cow were red or black;\\nher horns long or short; whether the field I graze her in be round or\\nsquare; whether she was milked at home or abroad; what diseases she is\\nsubject to, and the like; after which they consult precedents, adjourn\\nthe cause from time to time, and in ten, twenty, or thirty years, come\\nto an issue.\\n\\n“It is likewise to be observed, that this society has a peculiar cant\\nand jargon of their own, that no other mortal can understand, and\\nwherein all their laws are written, which they take special care to\\nmultiply; whereby they have wholly confounded the very essence of truth\\nand falsehood, of right and wrong; so that it will take thirty years to\\ndecide, whether the field left me by my ancestors for six generations\\nbelongs to me, or to a stranger three hundred miles off.\\n\\n“In the trial of persons accused for crimes against the state, the\\nmethod is much more short and commendable: the judge first sends to\\nsound the disposition of those in power, after which he can easily hang\\nor save a criminal, strictly preserving all due forms of law.”\\n\\nHere my master interposing, said, “it was a pity, that creatures\\nendowed with such prodigious abilities of mind, as these lawyers, by\\nthe description I gave of them, must certainly be, were not rather\\nencouraged to be instructors of others in wisdom and knowledge.” In\\nanswer to which I assured his honour, “that in all points out of their\\nown trade, they were usually the most ignorant and stupid generation\\namong us, the most despicable in common conversation, avowed enemies to\\nall knowledge and learning, and equally disposed to pervert the general\\nreason of mankind in every other subject of discourse as in that of\\ntheir own profession.”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\nA continuation of the state of England under Queen Anne. The character\\nof a first minister of state in European courts.\\n\\n\\nMy master was yet wholly at a loss to understand what motives could\\nincite this race of lawyers to perplex, disquiet, and weary themselves,\\nand engage in a confederacy of injustice, merely for the sake of\\ninjuring their fellow-animals; neither could he comprehend what I meant\\nin saying, they did it for hire. Whereupon I was at much pains to\\ndescribe to him the use of money, the materials it was made of, and the\\nvalue of the metals; “that when a _Yahoo_ had got a great store of this\\nprecious substance, he was able to purchase whatever he had a mind to;\\nthe finest clothing, the noblest houses, great tracts of land, the most\\ncostly meats and drinks, and have his choice of the most beautiful\\nfemales. Therefore since money alone was able to perform all these\\nfeats, our _Yahoos_ thought they could never have enough of it to\\nspend, or to save, as they found themselves inclined, from their\\nnatural bent either to profusion or avarice; that the rich man enjoyed\\nthe fruit of the poor man’s labour, and the latter were a thousand to\\none in proportion to the former; that the bulk of our people were\\nforced to live miserably, by labouring every day for small wages, to\\nmake a few live plentifully.”\\n\\nI enlarged myself much on these, and many other particulars to the same\\npurpose; but his honour was still to seek; for he went upon a\\nsupposition, that all animals had a title to their share in the\\nproductions of the earth, and especially those who presided over the\\nrest. Therefore he desired I would let him know, “what these costly\\nmeats were, and how any of us happened to want them?” Whereupon I\\nenumerated as many sorts as came into my head, with the various methods\\nof dressing them, which could not be done without sending vessels by\\nsea to every part of the world, as well for liquors to drink as for\\nsauces and innumerable other conveniences. I assured him “that this\\nwhole globe of earth must be at least three times gone round before one\\nof our better female _Yahoos_ could get her breakfast, or a cup to put\\nit in.” He said “that must needs be a miserable country which cannot\\nfurnish food for its own inhabitants. But what he chiefly wondered at\\nwas, how such vast tracts of ground as I described should be wholly\\nwithout fresh water, and the people put to the necessity of sending\\nover the sea for drink.” I replied “that England (the dear place of my\\nnativity) was computed to produce three times the quantity of food more\\nthan its inhabitants are able to consume, as well as liquors extracted\\nfrom grain, or pressed out of the fruit of certain trees, which made\\nexcellent drink, and the same proportion in every other convenience of\\nlife. But, in order to feed the luxury and intemperance of the males,\\nand the vanity of the females, we sent away the greatest part of our\\nnecessary things to other countries, whence, in return, we brought the\\nmaterials of diseases, folly, and vice, to spend among ourselves. Hence\\nit follows of necessity, that vast numbers of our people are compelled\\nto seek their livelihood by begging, robbing, stealing, cheating,\\npimping, flattering, suborning, forswearing, forging, gaming, lying,\\nfawning, hectoring, voting, scribbling, star-gazing, poisoning,\\nwhoring, canting, libelling, freethinking, and the like occupations:”\\nevery one of which terms I was at much pains to make him understand.\\n\\n“That wine was not imported among us from foreign countries to supply\\nthe want of water or other drinks, but because it was a sort of liquid\\nwhich made us merry by putting us out of our senses, diverted all\\nmelancholy thoughts, begat wild extravagant imaginations in the brain,\\nraised our hopes and banished our fears, suspended every office of\\nreason for a time, and deprived us of the use of our limbs, till we\\nfell into a profound sleep; although it must be confessed, that we\\nalways awaked sick and dispirited; and that the use of this liquor\\nfilled us with diseases which made our lives uncomfortable and short.\\n\\n“But beside all this, the bulk of our people supported themselves by\\nfurnishing the necessities or conveniences of life to the rich and to\\neach other. For instance, when I am at home, and dressed as I ought to\\nbe, I carry on my body the workmanship of a hundred tradesmen; the\\nbuilding and furniture of my house employ as many more, and five times\\nthe number to adorn my wife.”\\n\\nI was going on to tell him of another sort of people, who get their\\nlivelihood by attending the sick, having, upon some occasions, informed\\nhis honour that many of my crew had died of diseases. But here it was\\nwith the utmost difficulty that I brought him to apprehend what I\\nmeant. “He could easily conceive, that a _Houyhnhnm_, grew weak and\\nheavy a few days before his death, or by some accident might hurt a\\nlimb; but that nature, who works all things to perfection, should\\nsuffer any pains to breed in our bodies, he thought impossible, and\\ndesired to know the reason of so unaccountable an evil.”\\n\\nI told him “we fed on a thousand things which operated contrary to each\\nother; that we ate when we were not hungry, and drank without the\\nprovocation of thirst; that we sat whole nights drinking strong\\nliquors, without eating a bit, which disposed us to sloth, inflamed our\\nbodies, and precipitated or prevented digestion; that prostitute female\\n_Yahoos_ acquired a certain malady, which bred rottenness in the bones\\nof those who fell into their embraces; that this, and many other\\ndiseases, were propagated from father to son; so that great numbers\\ncame into the world with complicated maladies upon them; that it would\\nbe endless to give him a catalogue of all diseases incident to human\\nbodies, for they would not be fewer than five or six hundred, spread\\nover every limb and joint—in short, every part, external and intestine,\\nhaving diseases appropriated to itself. To remedy which, there was a\\nsort of people bred up among us in the profession, or pretence, of\\ncuring the sick. And because I had some skill in the faculty, I would,\\nin gratitude to his honour, let him know the whole mystery and method\\nby which they proceed.\\n\\n“Their fundamental is, that all diseases arise from repletion; whence\\nthey conclude, that a great evacuation of the body is necessary, either\\nthrough the natural passage or upwards at the mouth. Their next\\nbusiness is from herbs, minerals, gums, oils, shells, salts, juices,\\nsea-weed, excrements, barks of trees, serpents, toads, frogs, spiders,\\ndead men’s flesh and bones, birds, beasts, and fishes, to form a\\ncomposition, for smell and taste, the most abominable, nauseous, and\\ndetestable, they can possibly contrive, which the stomach immediately\\nrejects with loathing, and this they call a vomit; or else, from the\\nsame store-house, with some other poisonous additions, they command us\\nto take in at the orifice above or below (just as the physician then\\nhappens to be disposed) a medicine equally annoying and disgustful to\\nthe bowels; which, relaxing the belly, drives down all before it; and\\nthis they call a purge, or a clyster. For nature (as the physicians\\nallege) having intended the superior anterior orifice only for the\\nintromission of solids and liquids, and the inferior posterior for\\nejection, these artists ingeniously considering that in all diseases\\nnature is forced out of her seat, therefore, to replace her in it, the\\nbody must be treated in a manner directly contrary, by interchanging\\nthe use of each orifice; forcing solids and liquids in at the anus, and\\nmaking evacuations at the mouth.\\n\\n“But, besides real diseases, we are subject to many that are only\\nimaginary, for which the physicians have invented imaginary cures;\\nthese have their several names, and so have the drugs that are proper\\nfor them; and with these our female _Yahoos_ are always infested.\\n\\n“One great excellency in this tribe, is their skill at prognostics,\\nwherein they seldom fail; their predictions in real diseases, when they\\nrise to any degree of malignity, generally portending death, which is\\nalways in their power, when recovery is not: and therefore, upon any\\nunexpected signs of amendment, after they have pronounced their\\nsentence, rather than be accused as false prophets, they know how to\\napprove their sagacity to the world, by a seasonable dose.\\n\\n“They are likewise of special use to husbands and wives who are grown\\nweary of their mates; to eldest sons, to great ministers of state, and\\noften to princes.”\\n\\nI had formerly, upon occasion, discoursed with my master upon the\\nnature of government in general, and particularly of our own excellent\\nconstitution, deservedly the wonder and envy of the whole world. But\\nhaving here accidentally mentioned a minister of state, he commanded\\nme, some time after, to inform him, “what species of _Yahoo_ I\\nparticularly meant by that appellation.”\\n\\nI told him, “that a first or chief minister of state, who was the\\nperson I intended to describe, was the creature wholly exempt from joy\\nand grief, love and hatred, pity and anger; at least, makes use of no\\nother passions, but a violent desire of wealth, power, and titles; that\\nhe applies his words to all uses, except to the indication of his mind;\\nthat he never tells a truth but with an intent that you should take it\\nfor a lie; nor a lie, but with a design that you should take it for a\\ntruth; that those he speaks worst of behind their backs are in the\\nsurest way of preferment; and whenever he begins to praise you to\\nothers, or to yourself, you are from that day forlorn. The worst mark\\nyou can receive is a promise, especially when it is confirmed with an\\noath; after which, every wise man retires, and gives over all hopes.\\n\\n“There are three methods, by which a man may rise to be chief minister.\\nThe first is, by knowing how, with prudence, to dispose of a wife, a\\ndaughter, or a sister; the second, by betraying or undermining his\\npredecessor; and the third is, by a furious zeal, in public assemblies,\\nagainst the corruptions of the court. But a wise prince would rather\\nchoose to employ those who practise the last of these methods; because\\nsuch zealots prove always the most obsequious and subservient to the\\nwill and passions of their master. That these ministers, having all\\nemployments at their disposal, preserve themselves in power, by bribing\\nthe majority of a senate or great council; and at last, by an\\nexpedient, called an act of indemnity” (whereof I described the nature\\nto him), “they secure themselves from after-reckonings, and retire from\\nthe public laden with the spoils of the nation.\\n\\n“The palace of a chief minister is a seminary to breed up others in his\\nown trade: the pages, lackeys, and porters, by imitating their master,\\nbecome ministers of state in their several districts, and learn to\\nexcel in the three principal ingredients, of insolence, lying, and\\nbribery. Accordingly, they have a subaltern court paid to them by\\npersons of the best rank; and sometimes by the force of dexterity and\\nimpudence, arrive, through several gradations, to be successors to\\ntheir lord.\\n\\n“He is usually governed by a decayed wench, or favourite footman, who\\nare the tunnels through which all graces are conveyed, and may properly\\nbe called, in the last resort, the governors of the kingdom.”\\n\\nOne day, in discourse, my master, having heard me mention the nobility\\nof my country, was pleased to make me a compliment which I could not\\npretend to deserve: “that he was sure I must have been born of some\\nnoble family, because I far exceeded in shape, colour, and cleanliness,\\nall the _Yahoos_ of his nation, although I seemed to fail in strength\\nand agility, which must be imputed to my different way of living from\\nthose other brutes; and besides I was not only endowed with the faculty\\nof speech, but likewise with some rudiments of reason, to a degree\\nthat, with all his acquaintance, I passed for a prodigy.”\\n\\nHe made me observe, “that among the _Houyhnhnms_, the white, the\\nsorrel, and the iron-gray, were not so exactly shaped as the bay, the\\ndapple-gray, and the black; nor born with equal talents of mind, or a\\ncapacity to improve them; and therefore continued always in the\\ncondition of servants, without ever aspiring to match out of their own\\nrace, which in that country would be reckoned monstrous and unnatural.”\\n\\nI made his honour my most humble acknowledgments for the good opinion\\nhe was pleased to conceive of me, but assured him at the same time,\\n“that my birth was of the lower sort, having been born of plain honest\\nparents, who were just able to give me a tolerable education; that\\nnobility, among us, was altogether a different thing from the idea he\\nhad of it; that our young noblemen are bred from their childhood in\\nidleness and luxury; that, as soon as years will permit, they consume\\ntheir vigour, and contract odious diseases among lewd females; and when\\ntheir fortunes are almost ruined, they marry some woman of mean birth,\\ndisagreeable person, and unsound constitution (merely for the sake of\\nmoney), whom they hate and despise. That the productions of such\\nmarriages are generally scrofulous, rickety, or deformed children; by\\nwhich means the family seldom continues above three generations, unless\\nthe wife takes care to provide a healthy father, among her neighbours\\nor domestics, in order to improve and continue the breed. That a weak\\ndiseased body, a meagre countenance, and sallow complexion, are the\\ntrue marks of noble blood; and a healthy robust appearance is so\\ndisgraceful in a man of quality, that the world concludes his real\\nfather to have been a groom or a coachman. The imperfections of his\\nmind run parallel with those of his body, being a composition of\\nspleen, dullness, ignorance, caprice, sensuality, and pride.\\n\\n“Without the consent of this illustrious body, no law can be enacted,\\nrepealed, or altered: and these nobles have likewise the decision of\\nall our possessions, without appeal.” [514]\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\nThe author’s great love of his native country. His master’s\\nobservations upon the constitution and administration of England, as\\ndescribed by the author, with parallel cases and comparisons. His\\nmaster’s observations upon human nature.\\n\\n\\nThe reader may be disposed to wonder how I could prevail on myself to\\ngive so free a representation of my own species, among a race of\\nmortals who are already too apt to conceive the vilest opinion of\\nhumankind, from that entire congruity between me and their _Yahoos_.\\nBut I must freely confess, that the many virtues of those excellent\\nquadrupeds, placed in opposite view to human corruptions, had so far\\nopened my eyes and enlarged my understanding, that I began to view the\\nactions and passions of man in a very different light, and to think the\\nhonour of my own kind not worth managing; which, besides, it was\\nimpossible for me to do, before a person of so acute a judgment as my\\nmaster, who daily convinced me of a thousand faults in myself, whereof\\nI had not the least perception before, and which, with us, would never\\nbe numbered even among human infirmities. I had likewise learned, from\\nhis example, an utter detestation of all falsehood or disguise; and\\ntruth appeared so amiable to me, that I determined upon sacrificing\\nevery thing to it.\\n\\nLet me deal so candidly with the reader as to confess that there was\\nyet a much stronger motive for the freedom I took in my representation\\nof things. I had not yet been a year in this country before I\\ncontracted such a love and veneration for the inhabitants, that I\\nentered on a firm resolution never to return to humankind, but to pass\\nthe rest of my life among these admirable _Houyhnhnms_, in the\\ncontemplation and practice of every virtue, where I could have no\\nexample or incitement to vice. But it was decreed by fortune, my\\nperpetual enemy, that so great a felicity should not fall to my share.\\nHowever, it is now some comfort to reflect, that in what I said of my\\ncountrymen, I extenuated their faults as much as I durst before so\\nstrict an examiner; and upon every article gave as favourable a turn as\\nthe matter would bear. For, indeed, who is there alive that will not be\\nswayed by his bias and partiality to the place of his birth?\\n\\nI have related the substance of several conversations I had with my\\nmaster during the greatest part of the time I had the honour to be in\\nhis service; but have, indeed, for brevity sake, omitted much more than\\nis here set down.\\n\\nWhen I had answered all his questions, and his curiosity seemed to be\\nfully satisfied, he sent for me one morning early, and commanded me to\\nsit down at some distance (an honour which he had never before\\nconferred upon me). He said, “he had been very seriously considering my\\nwhole story, as far as it related both to myself and my country; that\\nhe looked upon us as a sort of animals, to whose share, by what\\naccident he could not conjecture, some small pittance of reason had\\nfallen, whereof we made no other use, than by its assistance, to\\naggravate our natural corruptions, and to acquire new ones, which\\nnature had not given us; that we disarmed ourselves of the few\\nabilities she had bestowed; had been very successful in multiplying our\\noriginal wants, and seemed to spend our whole lives in vain endeavours\\nto supply them by our own inventions; that, as to myself, it was\\nmanifest I had neither the strength nor agility of a common _Yahoo_;\\nthat I walked infirmly on my hinder feet; had found out a contrivance\\nto make my claws of no use or defence, and to remove the hair from my\\nchin, which was intended as a shelter from the sun and the weather:\\nlastly, that I could neither run with speed, nor climb trees like my\\nbrethren,” as he called them, “the _Yahoos_ in his country.\\n\\n“That our institutions of government and law were plainly owing to our\\ngross defects in reason, and by consequence in virtue; because reason\\nalone is sufficient to govern a rational creature; which was,\\ntherefore, a character we had no pretence to challenge, even from the\\naccount I had given of my own people; although he manifestly perceived,\\nthat, in order to favour them, I had concealed many particulars, and\\noften said the thing which was not.\\n\\n“He was the more confirmed in this opinion, because, he observed, that\\nas I agreed in every feature of my body with other _Yahoos_, except\\nwhere it was to my real disadvantage in point of strength, speed, and\\nactivity, the shortness of my claws, and some other particulars where\\nnature had no part; so from the representation I had given him of our\\nlives, our manners, and our actions, he found as near a resemblance in\\nthe disposition of our minds.” He said, “the _Yahoos_ were known to\\nhate one another, more than they did any different species of animals;\\nand the reason usually assigned was, the odiousness of their own\\nshapes, which all could see in the rest, but not in themselves. He had\\ntherefore begun to think it not unwise in us to cover our bodies, and\\nby that invention conceal many of our deformities from each other,\\nwhich would else be hardly supportable. But he now found he had been\\nmistaken, and that the dissensions of those brutes in his country were\\nowing to the same cause with ours, as I had described them. For if,”\\nsaid he, “you throw among five _Yahoos_ as much food as would be\\nsufficient for fifty, they will, instead of eating peaceably, fall\\ntogether by the ears, each single one impatient to have all to itself;\\nand therefore a servant was usually employed to stand by while they\\nwere feeding abroad, and those kept at home were tied at a distance\\nfrom each other: that if a cow died of age or accident, before a\\n_Houyhnhnm_ could secure it for his own _Yahoos_, those in the\\nneighbourhood would come in herds to seize it, and then would ensue\\nsuch a battle as I had described, with terrible wounds made by their\\nclaws on both sides, although they seldom were able to kill one\\nanother, for want of such convenient instruments of death as we had\\ninvented. At other times, the like battles have been fought between the\\n_Yahoos_ of several neighbourhoods, without any visible cause; those of\\none district watching all opportunities to surprise the next, before\\nthey are prepared. But if they find their project has miscarried, they\\nreturn home, and, for want of enemies, engage in what I call a civil\\nwar among themselves.\\n\\n“That in some fields of his country there are certain shining stones of\\nseveral colours, whereof the _Yahoos_ are violently fond: and when part\\nof these stones is fixed in the earth, as it sometimes happens, they\\nwill dig with their claws for whole days to get them out; then carry\\nthem away, and hide them by heaps in their kennels; but still looking\\nround with great caution, for fear their comrades should find out their\\ntreasure.” My master said, “he could never discover the reason of this\\nunnatural appetite, or how these stones could be of any use to a\\n_Yahoo_; but now he believed it might proceed from the same principle\\nof avarice which I had ascribed to mankind. That he had once, by way of\\nexperiment, privately removed a heap of these stones from the place\\nwhere one of his _Yahoos_ had buried it; whereupon the sordid animal,\\nmissing his treasure, by his loud lamenting brought the whole herd to\\nthe place, there miserably howled, then fell to biting and tearing the\\nrest, began to pine away, would neither eat, nor sleep, nor work, till\\nhe ordered a servant privately to convey the stones into the same hole,\\nand hide them as before; which, when his _Yahoo_ had found, he\\npresently recovered his spirits and good humour, but took good care to\\nremove them to a better hiding place, and has ever since been a very\\nserviceable brute.”\\n\\nMy master further assured me, which I also observed myself, “that in\\nthe fields where the shining stones abound, the fiercest and most\\nfrequent battles are fought, occasioned by perpetual inroads of the\\nneighbouring _Yahoos_.”\\n\\nHe said, “it was common, when two _Yahoos_ discovered such a stone in a\\nfield, and were contending which of them should be the proprietor, a\\nthird would take the advantage, and carry it away from them both;”\\nwhich my master would needs contend to have some kind of resemblance\\nwith our suits at law; wherein I thought it for our credit not to\\nundeceive him; since the decision he mentioned was much more equitable\\nthan many decrees among us; because the plaintiff and defendant there\\nlost nothing beside the stone they contended for: whereas our courts of\\nequity would never have dismissed the cause, while either of them had\\nany thing left.\\n\\nMy master, continuing his discourse, said, “there was nothing that\\nrendered the _Yahoos_ more odious, than their undistinguishing appetite\\nto devour every thing that came in their way, whether herbs, roots,\\nberries, the corrupted flesh of animals, or all mingled together: and\\nit was peculiar in their temper, that they were fonder of what they\\ncould get by rapine or stealth, at a greater distance, than much better\\nfood provided for them at home. If their prey held out, they would eat\\ntill they were ready to burst; after which, nature had pointed out to\\nthem a certain root that gave them a general evacuation.\\n\\n“There was also another kind of root, very juicy, but somewhat rare and\\ndifficult to be found, which the _Yahoos_ sought for with much\\neagerness, and would suck it with great delight; it produced in them\\nthe same effects that wine has upon us. It would make them sometimes\\nhug, and sometimes tear one another; they would howl, and grin, and\\nchatter, and reel, and tumble, and then fall asleep in the mud.”\\n\\nI did indeed observe that the _Yahoos_ were the only animals in this\\ncountry subject to any diseases; which, however, were much fewer than\\nhorses have among us, and contracted, not by any ill-treatment they\\nmeet with, but by the nastiness and greediness of that sordid brute.\\nNeither has their language any more than a general appellation for\\nthose maladies, which is borrowed from the name of the beast, and\\ncalled _hnea-yahoo_, or _Yahoo’s evil_; and the cure prescribed is a\\nmixture of their own dung and urine, forcibly put down the _Yahoo’s_\\nthroat. This I have since often known to have been taken with success,\\nand do here freely recommend it to my countrymen for the public good,\\nas an admirable specific against all diseases produced by repletion.\\n\\n“As to learning, government, arts, manufactures, and the like,” my\\nmaster confessed, “he could find little or no resemblance between the\\n_Yahoos_ of that country and those in ours; for he only meant to\\nobserve what parity there was in our natures. He had heard, indeed,\\nsome curious _Houyhnhnms_ observe, that in most herds there was a sort\\nof ruling _Yahoo_ (as among us there is generally some leading or\\nprincipal stag in a park), who was always more deformed in body, and\\nmischievous in disposition, than any of the rest; that this leader had\\nusually a favourite as like himself as he could get, whose employment\\nwas to lick his master’s feet and posteriors, and drive the female\\n_Yahoos_ to his kennel; for which he was now and then rewarded with a\\npiece of ass’s flesh. This favourite is hated by the whole herd, and\\ntherefore, to protect himself, keeps always near the person of his\\nleader. He usually continues in office till a worse can be found; but\\nthe very moment he is discarded, his successor, at the head of all the\\n_Yahoos_ in that district, young and old, male and female, come in a\\nbody, and discharge their excrements upon him from head to foot. But\\nhow far this might be applicable to our courts, and favourites, and\\nministers of state, my master said I could best determine.”\\n\\nI durst make no return to this malicious insinuation, which debased\\nhuman understanding below the sagacity of a common hound, who has\\njudgment enough to distinguish and follow the cry of the ablest dog in\\nthe pack, without being ever mistaken.\\n\\nMy master told me, “there were some qualities remarkable in the\\n_Yahoos_, which he had not observed me to mention, or at least very\\nslightly, in the accounts I had given of humankind.” He said, “those\\nanimals, like other brutes, had their females in common; but in this\\nthey differed, that the she _Yahoo_ would admit the males while she was\\npregnant; and that the hes would quarrel and fight with the females, as\\nfiercely as with each other; both which practices were such degrees of\\ninfamous brutality, as no other sensitive creature ever arrived at.\\n\\n“Another thing he wondered at in the _Yahoos_, was their strange\\ndisposition to nastiness and dirt; whereas there appears to be a\\nnatural love of cleanliness in all other animals.” As to the two former\\naccusations, I was glad to let them pass without any reply, because I\\nhad not a word to offer upon them in defence of my species, which\\notherwise I certainly had done from my own inclinations. But I could\\nhave easily vindicated humankind from the imputation of singularity\\nupon the last article, if there had been any swine in that country (as\\nunluckily for me there were not), which, although it may be a sweeter\\nquadruped than a _Yahoo_, cannot, I humbly conceive, in justice,\\npretend to more cleanliness; and so his honour himself must have owned,\\nif he had seen their filthy way of feeding, and their custom of\\nwallowing and sleeping in the mud.\\n\\nMy master likewise mentioned another quality which his servants had\\ndiscovered in several Yahoos, and to him was wholly unaccountable. He\\nsaid, “a fancy would sometimes take a _Yahoo_ to retire into a corner,\\nto lie down, and howl, and groan, and spurn away all that came near\\nhim, although he were young and fat, wanted neither food nor water, nor\\ndid the servant imagine what could possibly ail him. And the only\\nremedy they found was, to set him to hard work, after which he would\\ninfallibly come to himself.” To this I was silent out of partiality to\\nmy own kind; yet here I could plainly discover the true seeds of\\nspleen, which only seizes on the lazy, the luxurious, and the rich;\\nwho, if they were forced to undergo the same regimen, I would undertake\\nfor the cure.\\n\\nHis honour had further observed, “that a female _Yahoo_ would often\\nstand behind a bank or a bush, to gaze on the young males passing by,\\nand then appear, and hide, using many antic gestures and grimaces, at\\nwhich time it was observed that she had a most offensive smell; and\\nwhen any of the males advanced, would slowly retire, looking often\\nback, and with a counterfeit show of fear, run off into some convenient\\nplace, where she knew the male would follow her.\\n\\n“At other times, if a female stranger came among them, three or four of\\nher own sex would get about her, and stare, and chatter, and grin, and\\nsmell her all over; and then turn off with gestures, that seemed to\\nexpress contempt and disdain.”\\n\\nPerhaps my master might refine a little in these speculations, which he\\nhad drawn from what he observed himself, or had been told him by\\nothers; however, I could not reflect without some amazement, and much\\nsorrow, that the rudiments of lewdness, coquetry, censure, and scandal,\\nshould have place by instinct in womankind.\\n\\nI expected every moment that my master would accuse the _Yahoos_ of\\nthose unnatural appetites in both sexes, so common among us. But\\nnature, it seems, has not been so expert a school-mistress; and these\\npoliter pleasures are entirely the productions of art and reason on our\\nside of the globe.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\nThe author relates several particulars of the _Yahoos_. The great\\nvirtues of the _Houyhnhnms_. The education and exercise of their youth.\\nTheir general assembly.\\n\\n\\nAs I ought to have understood human nature much better than I supposed\\nit possible for my master to do, so it was easy to apply the character\\nhe gave of the _Yahoos_ to myself and my countrymen; and I believed I\\ncould yet make further discoveries, from my own observation. I\\ntherefore often begged his honour to let me go among the herds of\\n_Yahoos_ in the neighbourhood; to which he always very graciously\\nconsented, being perfectly convinced that the hatred I bore these\\nbrutes would never suffer me to be corrupted by them; and his honour\\nordered one of his servants, a strong sorrel nag, very honest and\\ngood-natured, to be my guard; without whose protection I durst not\\nundertake such adventures. For I have already told the reader how much\\nI was pestered by these odious animals, upon my first arrival; and I\\nafterwards failed very narrowly, three or four times, of falling into\\ntheir clutches, when I happened to stray at any distance without my\\nhanger. And I have reason to believe they had some imagination that I\\nwas of their own species, which I often assisted myself by stripping up\\nmy sleeves, and showing my naked arms and breast in their sight, when\\nmy protector was with me. At which times they would approach as near as\\nthey durst, and imitate my actions after the manner of monkeys, but\\never with great signs of hatred; as a tame jackdaw with cap and\\nstockings is always persecuted by the wild ones, when he happens to be\\ngot among them.\\n\\nThey are prodigiously nimble from their infancy. However, I once caught\\na young male of three years old, and endeavoured, by all marks of\\ntenderness, to make it quiet; but the little imp fell a squalling and\\nscratching and biting with such violence, that I was forced to let it\\ngo; and it was high time, for a whole troop of old ones came about us\\nat the noise, but finding the cub was safe (for away it ran), and my\\nsorrel nag being by, they durst not venture near us. I observed the\\nyoung animal’s flesh to smell very rank, and the stink was somewhat\\nbetween a weasel and a fox, but much more disagreeable. I forgot\\nanother circumstance (and perhaps I might have the reader’s pardon if\\nit were wholly omitted), that while I held the odious vermin in my\\nhands, it voided its filthy excrements of a yellow liquid substance all\\nover my clothes; but by good fortune there was a small brook hard by,\\nwhere I washed myself as clean as I could; although I durst not come\\ninto my master’s presence until I were sufficiently aired.\\n\\nBy what I could discover, the _Yahoos_ appear to be the most\\nunteachable of all animals, their capacity never reaching higher than\\nto draw or carry burdens. Yet I am of opinion this defect arises\\nchiefly from a perverse, restive disposition; for they are cunning,\\nmalicious, treacherous, and revengeful. They are strong and hardy, but\\nof a cowardly spirit, and, by consequence, insolent, abject, and cruel.\\nIt is observed, that the red haired of both sexes are more libidinous\\nand mischievous than the rest, whom yet they much exceed in strength\\nand activity.\\n\\nThe _Houyhnhnms_ keep the _Yahoos_ for present use in huts not far from\\nthe house; but the rest are sent abroad to certain fields, where they\\ndig up roots, eat several kinds of herbs, and search about for carrion,\\nor sometimes catch weasels and _luhimuhs_ (a sort of wild rat), which\\nthey greedily devour. Nature has taught them to dig deep holes with\\ntheir nails on the side of a rising ground, wherein they lie by\\nthemselves; only the kennels of the females are larger, sufficient to\\nhold two or three cubs.\\n\\nThey swim from their infancy like frogs, and are able to continue long\\nunder water, where they often take fish, which the females carry home\\nto their young. And, upon this occasion, I hope the reader will pardon\\nmy relating an odd adventure.\\n\\nBeing one day abroad with my protector the sorrel nag, and the weather\\nexceeding hot, I entreated him to let me bathe in a river that was\\nnear. He consented, and I immediately stripped myself stark naked, and\\nwent down softly into the stream. It happened that a young female\\n_Yahoo_, standing behind a bank, saw the whole proceeding, and inflamed\\nby desire, as the nag and I conjectured, came running with all speed,\\nand leaped into the water, within five yards of the place where I\\nbathed. I was never in my life so terribly frightened. The nag was\\ngrazing at some distance, not suspecting any harm. She embraced me\\nafter a most fulsome manner. I roared as loud as I could, and the nag\\ncame galloping towards me, whereupon she quitted her grasp, with the\\nutmost reluctancy, and leaped upon the opposite bank, where she stood\\ngazing and howling all the time I was putting on my clothes.\\n\\nThis was a matter of diversion to my master and his family, as well as\\nof mortification to myself. For now I could no longer deny that I was a\\nreal _Yahoo_ in every limb and feature, since the females had a natural\\npropensity to me, as one of their own species. Neither was the hair of\\nthis brute of a red colour (which might have been some excuse for an\\nappetite a little irregular), but black as a sloe, and her countenance\\ndid not make an appearance altogether so hideous as the rest of her\\nkind; for I think she could not be above eleven years old.\\n\\nHaving lived three years in this country, the reader, I suppose, will\\nexpect that I should, like other travellers, give him some account of\\nthe manners and customs of its inhabitants, which it was indeed my\\nprincipal study to learn.\\n\\nAs these noble _Houyhnhnms_ are endowed by nature with a general\\ndisposition to all virtues, and have no conceptions or ideas of what is\\nevil in a rational creature, so their grand maxim is, to cultivate\\nreason, and to be wholly governed by it. Neither is reason among them a\\npoint problematical, as with us, where men can argue with plausibility\\non both sides of the question, but strikes you with immediate\\nconviction; as it must needs do, where it is not mingled, obscured, or\\ndiscoloured, by passion and interest. I remember it was with extreme\\ndifficulty that I could bring my master to understand the meaning of\\nthe word opinion, or how a point could be disputable; because reason\\ntaught us to affirm or deny only where we are certain; and beyond our\\nknowledge we cannot do either. So that controversies, wranglings,\\ndisputes, and positiveness, in false or dubious propositions, are evils\\nunknown among the _Houyhnhnms_. In the like manner, when I used to\\nexplain to him our several systems of natural philosophy, he would\\nlaugh, “that a creature pretending to reason, should value itself upon\\nthe knowledge of other people’s conjectures, and in things where that\\nknowledge, if it were certain, could be of no use.” Wherein he agreed\\nentirely with the sentiments of Socrates, as Plato delivers them; which\\nI mention as the highest honour I can do that prince of philosophers. I\\nhave often since reflected, what destruction such doctrine would make\\nin the libraries of Europe; and how many paths of fame would be then\\nshut up in the learned world.\\n\\nFriendship and benevolence are the two principal virtues among the\\n_Houyhnhnms_; and these not confined to particular objects, but\\nuniversal to the whole race; for a stranger from the remotest part is\\nequally treated with the nearest neighbour, and wherever he goes, looks\\nupon himself as at home. They preserve decency and civility in the\\nhighest degrees, but are altogether ignorant of ceremony. They have no\\nfondness for their colts or foals, but the care they take in educating\\nthem proceeds entirely from the dictates of reason. And I observed my\\nmaster to show the same affection to his neighbour’s issue, that he had\\nfor his own. They will have it that nature teaches them to love the\\nwhole species, and it is reason only that makes a distinction of\\npersons, where there is a superior degree of virtue.\\n\\nWhen the matron _Houyhnhnms_ have produced one of each sex, they no\\nlonger accompany with their consorts, except they lose one of their\\nissue by some casualty, which very seldom happens; but in such a case\\nthey meet again; or when the like accident befalls a person whose wife\\nis past bearing, some other couple bestow on him one of their own\\ncolts, and then go together again until the mother is pregnant. This\\ncaution is necessary, to prevent the country from being overburdened\\nwith numbers. But the race of inferior _Houyhnhnms_, bred up to be\\nservants, is not so strictly limited upon this article: these are\\nallowed to produce three of each sex, to be domestics in the noble\\nfamilies.\\n\\nIn their marriages, they are exactly careful to choose such colours as\\nwill not make any disagreeable mixture in the breed. Strength is\\nchiefly valued in the male, and comeliness in the female; not upon the\\naccount of love, but to preserve the race from degenerating; for where\\na female happens to excel in strength, a consort is chosen, with regard\\nto comeliness.\\n\\nCourtship, love, presents, jointures, settlements have no place in\\ntheir thoughts, or terms whereby to express them in their language. The\\nyoung couple meet, and are joined, merely because it is the\\ndetermination of their parents and friends; it is what they see done\\nevery day, and they look upon it as one of the necessary actions of a\\nreasonable being. But the violation of marriage, or any other\\nunchastity, was never heard of; and the married pair pass their lives\\nwith the same friendship and mutual benevolence, that they bear to all\\nothers of the same species who come in their way, without jealousy,\\nfondness, quarrelling, or discontent.\\n\\nIn educating the youth of both sexes, their method is admirable, and\\nhighly deserves our imitation. These are not suffered to taste a grain\\nof oats, except upon certain days, till eighteen years old; nor milk,\\nbut very rarely; and in summer they graze two hours in the morning, and\\nas many in the evening, which their parents likewise observe; but the\\nservants are not allowed above half that time, and a great part of\\ntheir grass is brought home, which they eat at the most convenient\\nhours, when they can be best spared from work.\\n\\nTemperance, industry, exercise, and cleanliness, are the lessons\\nequally enjoined to the young ones of both sexes: and my master thought\\nit monstrous in us, to give the females a different kind of education\\nfrom the males, except in some articles of domestic management;\\nwhereby, as he truly observed, one half of our natives were good for\\nnothing but bringing children into the world; and to trust the care of\\nour children to such useless animals, he said, was yet a greater\\ninstance of brutality.\\n\\nBut the _Houyhnhnms_ train up their youth to strength, speed, and\\nhardiness, by exercising them in running races up and down steep hills,\\nand over hard stony grounds; and when they are all in a sweat, they are\\nordered to leap over head and ears into a pond or river. Four times a\\nyear the youth of a certain district meet to show their proficiency in\\nrunning and leaping, and other feats of strength and agility; where the\\nvictor is rewarded with a song in his or her praise. On this festival,\\nthe servants drive a herd of _Yahoos_ into the field, laden with hay,\\nand oats, and milk, for a repast to the _Houyhnhnms_; after which,\\nthese brutes are immediately driven back again, for fear of being\\nnoisome to the assembly.\\n\\nEvery fourth year, at the vernal equinox, there is a representative\\ncouncil of the whole nation, which meets in a plain about twenty miles\\nfrom our house, and continues about five or six days. Here they inquire\\ninto the state and condition of the several districts; whether they\\nabound or be deficient in hay or oats, or cows, or _Yahoos_; and\\nwherever there is any want (which is but seldom) it is immediately\\nsupplied by unanimous consent and contribution. Here likewise the\\nregulation of children is settled: as for instance, if a _Houyhnhnm_\\nhas two males, he changes one of them with another that has two\\nfemales; and when a child has been lost by any casualty, where the\\nmother is past breeding, it is determined what family in the district\\nshall breed another to supply the loss.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\nA grand debate at the general assembly of the _Houyhnhnms_, and how it\\nwas determined. The learning of the _Houyhnhnms_. Their buildings.\\nTheir manner of burials. The defectiveness of their language.\\n\\n\\nOne of these grand assemblies was held in my time, about three months\\nbefore my departure, whither my master went as the representative of\\nour district. In this council was resumed their old debate, and indeed\\nthe only debate that ever happened in their country; whereof my master,\\nafter his return, gave me a very particular account.\\n\\nThe question to be debated was, “whether the _Yahoos_ should be\\nexterminated from the face of the earth?” One of the members for the\\naffirmative offered several arguments of great strength and weight,\\nalleging, “that as the _Yahoos_ were the most filthy, noisome, and\\ndeformed animals which nature ever produced, so they were the most\\nrestive and indocible, mischievous and malicious; they would privately\\nsuck the teats of the _Houyhnhnms’_ cows, kill and devour their cats,\\ntrample down their oats and grass, if they were not continually\\nwatched, and commit a thousand other extravagancies.” He took notice of\\na general tradition, “that _Yahoos_ had not been always in their\\ncountry; but that many ages ago, two of these brutes appeared together\\nupon a mountain; whether produced by the heat of the sun upon corrupted\\nmud and slime, or from the ooze and froth of the sea, was never known;\\nthat these _Yahoos_ engendered, and their brood, in a short time, grew\\nso numerous as to overrun and infest the whole nation; that the\\n_Houyhnhnms_, to get rid of this evil, made a general hunting, and at\\nlast enclosed the whole herd; and destroying the elder, every\\n_Houyhnhnm_ kept two young ones in a kennel, and brought them to such a\\ndegree of tameness, as an animal, so savage by nature, can be capable\\nof acquiring, using them for draught and carriage; that there seemed to\\nbe much truth in this tradition, and that those creatures could not be\\n_yinhniamshy_ (or _aborigines_ of the land), because of the violent\\nhatred the _Houyhnhnms_, as well as all other animals, bore them,\\nwhich, although their evil disposition sufficiently deserved, could\\nnever have arrived at so high a degree if they had been _aborigines_,\\nor else they would have long since been rooted out; that the\\ninhabitants, taking a fancy to use the service of the _Yahoos_, had,\\nvery imprudently, neglected to cultivate the breed of asses, which are\\na comely animal, easily kept, more tame and orderly, without any\\noffensive smell, strong enough for labour, although they yield to the\\nother in agility of body, and if their braying be no agreeable sound,\\nit is far preferable to the horrible howlings of the _Yahoos_.”\\n\\nSeveral others declared their sentiments to the same purpose, when my\\nmaster proposed an expedient to the assembly, whereof he had indeed\\nborrowed the hint from me. “He approved of the tradition mentioned by\\nthe honourable member who spoke before, and affirmed, that the two\\n_Yahoos_ said to be seen first among them, had been driven thither over\\nthe sea; that coming to land, and being forsaken by their companions,\\nthey retired to the mountains, and degenerating by degrees, became in\\nprocess of time much more savage than those of their own species in the\\ncountry whence these two originals came. The reason of this assertion\\nwas, that he had now in his possession a certain wonderful _Yahoo_\\n(meaning myself) which most of them had heard of, and many of them had\\nseen. He then related to them how he first found me; that my body was\\nall covered with an artificial composure of the skins and hairs of\\nother animals; that I spoke in a language of my own, and had thoroughly\\nlearned theirs; that I had related to him the accidents which brought\\nme thither; that when he saw me without my covering, I was an exact\\n_Yahoo_ in every part, only of a whiter colour, less hairy, and with\\nshorter claws. He added, how I had endeavoured to persuade him, that in\\nmy own and other countries, the _Yahoos_ acted as the governing,\\nrational animal, and held the _Houyhnhnms_ in servitude; that he\\nobserved in me all the qualities of a _Yahoo_, only a little more\\ncivilized by some tincture of reason, which, however, was in a degree\\nas far inferior to the _Houyhnhnm_ race, as the _Yahoos_ of their\\ncountry were to me; that, among other things, I mentioned a custom we\\nhad of castrating _Houyhnhnms_ when they were young, in order to render\\nthem tame; that the operation was easy and safe; that it was no shame\\nto learn wisdom from brutes, as industry is taught by the ant, and\\nbuilding by the swallow (for so I translate the word _lyhannh_,\\nalthough it be a much larger fowl); that this invention might be\\npractised upon the younger _Yahoos_ here, which besides rendering them\\ntractable and fitter for use, would in an age put an end to the whole\\nspecies, without destroying life; that in the mean time the\\n_Houyhnhnms_ should be exhorted to cultivate the breed of asses, which,\\nas they are in all respects more valuable brutes, so they have this\\nadvantage, to be fit for service at five years old, which the others\\nare not till twelve.”\\n\\nThis was all my master thought fit to tell me, at that time, of what\\npassed in the grand council. But he was pleased to conceal one\\nparticular, which related personally to myself, whereof I soon felt the\\nunhappy effect, as the reader will know in its proper place, and whence\\nI date all the succeeding misfortunes of my life.\\n\\nThe _Houyhnhnms_ have no letters, and consequently their knowledge is\\nall traditional. But there happening few events of any moment among a\\npeople so well united, naturally disposed to every virtue, wholly\\ngoverned by reason, and cut off from all commerce with other nations,\\nthe historical part is easily preserved without burdening their\\nmemories. I have already observed that they are subject to no diseases,\\nand therefore can have no need of physicians. However, they have\\nexcellent medicines, composed of herbs, to cure accidental bruises and\\ncuts in the pastern or frog of the foot, by sharp stones, as well as\\nother maims and hurts in the several parts of the body.\\n\\nThey calculate the year by the revolution of the sun and moon, but use\\nno subdivisions into weeks. They are well enough acquainted with the\\nmotions of those two luminaries, and understand the nature of eclipses;\\nand this is the utmost progress of their astronomy.\\n\\nIn poetry, they must be allowed to excel all other mortals; wherein the\\njustness of their similes, and the minuteness as well as exactness of\\ntheir descriptions, are indeed inimitable. Their verses abound very\\nmuch in both of these, and usually contain either some exalted notions\\nof friendship and benevolence or the praises of those who were victors\\nin races and other bodily exercises. Their buildings, although very\\nrude and simple, are not inconvenient, but well contrived to defend\\nthem from all injuries of cold and heat. They have a kind of tree,\\nwhich at forty years old loosens in the root, and falls with the first\\nstorm: it grows very straight, and being pointed like stakes with a\\nsharp stone (for the _Houyhnhnms_ know not the use of iron), they stick\\nthem erect in the ground, about ten inches asunder, and then weave in\\noat straw, or sometimes wattles, between them. The roof is made after\\nthe same manner, and so are the doors.\\n\\nThe _Houyhnhnms_ use the hollow part, between the pastern and the hoof\\nof their fore-foot, as we do our hands, and this with greater dexterity\\nthan I could at first imagine. I have seen a white mare of our family\\nthread a needle (which I lent her on purpose) with that joint. They\\nmilk their cows, reap their oats, and do all the work which requires\\nhands, in the same manner. They have a kind of hard flints, which, by\\ngrinding against other stones, they form into instruments, that serve\\ninstead of wedges, axes, and hammers. With tools made of these flints,\\nthey likewise cut their hay, and reap their oats, which there grow\\nnaturally in several fields; the _Yahoos_ draw home the sheaves in\\ncarriages, and the servants tread them in certain covered huts to get\\nout the grain, which is kept in stores. They make a rude kind of\\nearthen and wooden vessels, and bake the former in the sun.\\n\\nIf they can avoid casualties, they die only of old age, and are buried\\nin the obscurest places that can be found, their friends and relations\\nexpressing neither joy nor grief at their departure; nor does the dying\\nperson discover the least regret that he is leaving the world, any more\\nthan if he were upon returning home from a visit to one of his\\nneighbours. I remember my master having once made an appointment with a\\nfriend and his family to come to his house, upon some affair of\\nimportance: on the day fixed, the mistress and her two children came\\nvery late; she made two excuses, first for her husband, who, as she\\nsaid, happened that very morning to _shnuwnh_. The word is strongly\\nexpressive in their language, but not easily rendered into English; it\\nsignifies, “to retire to his first mother.” Her excuse for not coming\\nsooner, was, that her husband dying late in the morning, she was a good\\nwhile consulting her servants about a convenient place where his body\\nshould be laid; and I observed, she behaved herself at our house as\\ncheerfully as the rest. She died about three months after.\\n\\nThey live generally to seventy, or seventy-five years, very seldom to\\nfourscore. Some weeks before their death, they feel a gradual decay;\\nbut without pain. During this time they are much visited by their\\nfriends, because they cannot go abroad with their usual ease and\\nsatisfaction. However, about ten days before their death, which they\\nseldom fail in computing, they return the visits that have been made\\nthem by those who are nearest in the neighbourhood, being carried in a\\nconvenient sledge drawn by _Yahoos_; which vehicle they use, not only\\nupon this occasion, but when they grow old, upon long journeys, or when\\nthey are lamed by any accident: and therefore when the dying\\n_Houyhnhnms_ return those visits, they take a solemn leave of their\\nfriends, as if they were going to some remote part of the country,\\nwhere they designed to pass the rest of their lives.\\n\\nI know not whether it may be worth observing, that the _Houyhnhnms_\\nhave no word in their language to express any thing that is evil,\\nexcept what they borrow from the deformities or ill qualities of the\\n_Yahoos_. Thus they denote the folly of a servant, an omission of a\\nchild, a stone that cuts their feet, a continuance of foul or\\nunseasonable weather, and the like, by adding to each the epithet of\\n_Yahoo_. For instance, _hhnm Yahoo_; _whnaholm Yahoo_, _ynlhmndwihlma\\nYahoo_, and an ill-contrived house _ynholmhnmrohlnw Yahoo_.\\n\\nI could, with great pleasure, enlarge further upon the manners and\\nvirtues of this excellent people; but intending in a short time to\\npublish a volume by itself, expressly upon that subject, I refer the\\nreader thither; and, in the mean time, proceed to relate my own sad\\ncatastrophe.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\nThe author’s economy, and happy life among the Houyhnhnms. His great\\nimprovement in virtue by conversing with them. Their conversations. The\\nauthor has notice given him by his master, that he must depart from the\\ncountry. He falls into a swoon for grief; but submits. He contrives and\\nfinishes a canoe by the help of a fellow-servant, and puts to sea at a\\nventure.\\n\\n\\nI had settled my little economy to my own heart’s content. My master\\nhad ordered a room to be made for me, after their manner, about six\\nyards from the house: the sides and floors of which I plastered with\\nclay, and covered with rush-mats of my own contriving. I had beaten\\nhemp, which there grows wild, and made of it a sort of ticking; this I\\nfilled with the feathers of several birds I had taken with springes\\nmade of _Yahoos’_ hairs, and were excellent food. I had worked two\\nchairs with my knife, the sorrel nag helping me in the grosser and more\\nlaborious part. When my clothes were worn to rags, I made myself others\\nwith the skins of rabbits, and of a certain beautiful animal, about the\\nsame size, called _nnuhnoh_, the skin of which is covered with a fine\\ndown. Of these I also made very tolerable stockings. I soled my shoes\\nwith wood, which I cut from a tree, and fitted to the upper-leather;\\nand when this was worn out, I supplied it with the skins of _Yahoos_\\ndried in the sun. I often got honey out of hollow trees, which I\\nmingled with water, or ate with my bread. No man could more verify the\\ntruth of these two maxims, “That nature is very easily satisfied;” and,\\n“That necessity is the mother of invention.” I enjoyed perfect health\\nof body, and tranquillity of mind; I did not feel the treachery or\\ninconstancy of a friend, nor the injuries of a secret or open enemy. I\\nhad no occasion of bribing, flattering, or pimping, to procure the\\nfavour of any great man, or of his minion; I wanted no fence against\\nfraud or oppression: here was neither physician to destroy my body, nor\\nlawyer to ruin my fortune; no informer to watch my words and actions,\\nor forge accusations against me for hire: here were no gibers,\\ncensurers, backbiters, pickpockets, highwaymen, housebreakers,\\nattorneys, bawds, buffoons, gamesters, politicians, wits, splenetics,\\ntedious talkers, controvertists, ravishers, murderers, robbers,\\nvirtuosos; no leaders, or followers, of party and faction; no\\nencouragers to vice, by seducement or examples; no dungeon, axes,\\ngibbets, whipping-posts, or pillories; no cheating shopkeepers or\\nmechanics; no pride, vanity, or affectation; no fops, bullies,\\ndrunkards, strolling whores, or poxes; no ranting, lewd, expensive\\nwives; no stupid, proud pedants; no importunate, overbearing,\\nquarrelsome, noisy, roaring, empty, conceited, swearing companions; no\\nscoundrels raised from the dust upon the merit of their vices, or\\nnobility thrown into it on account of their virtues; no lords,\\nfiddlers, judges, or dancing-masters.\\n\\nI had the favour of being admitted to several _Houyhnhnms_, who came to\\nvisit or dine with my master; where his honour graciously suffered me\\nto wait in the room, and listen to their discourse. Both he and his\\ncompany would often descend to ask me questions, and receive my\\nanswers. I had also sometimes the honour of attending my master in his\\nvisits to others. I never presumed to speak, except in answer to a\\nquestion; and then I did it with inward regret, because it was a loss\\nof so much time for improving myself; but I was infinitely delighted\\nwith the station of an humble auditor in such conversations, where\\nnothing passed but what was useful, expressed in the fewest and most\\nsignificant words; where, as I have already said, the greatest decency\\nwas observed, without the least degree of ceremony; where no person\\nspoke without being pleased himself, and pleasing his companions; where\\nthere was no interruption, tediousness, heat, or difference of\\nsentiments. They have a notion, that when people are met together, a\\nshort silence does much improve conversation: this I found to be true;\\nfor during those little intermissions of talk, new ideas would arise in\\ntheir minds, which very much enlivened the discourse. Their subjects\\nare generally on friendship and benevolence, on order and economy;\\nsometimes upon the visible operations of nature, or ancient traditions;\\nupon the bounds and limits of virtue; upon the unerring rules of\\nreason, or upon some determinations to be taken at the next great\\nassembly: and often upon the various excellences of poetry. I may add,\\nwithout vanity, that my presence often gave them sufficient matter for\\ndiscourse, because it afforded my master an occasion of letting his\\nfriends into the history of me and my country, upon which they were all\\npleased to descant, in a manner not very advantageous to humankind: and\\nfor that reason I shall not repeat what they said; only I may be\\nallowed to observe, that his honour, to my great admiration, appeared\\nto understand the nature of _Yahoos_ much better than myself. He went\\nthrough all our vices and follies, and discovered many, which I had\\nnever mentioned to him, by only supposing what qualities a _Yahoo_ of\\ntheir country, with a small proportion of reason, might be capable of\\nexerting; and concluded, with too much probability, “how vile, as well\\nas miserable, such a creature must be.”\\n\\nI freely confess, that all the little knowledge I have of any value,\\nwas acquired by the lectures I received from my master, and from\\nhearing the discourses of him and his friends; to which I should be\\nprouder to listen, than to dictate to the greatest and wisest assembly\\nin Europe. I admired the strength, comeliness, and speed of the\\ninhabitants; and such a constellation of virtues, in such amiable\\npersons, produced in me the highest veneration. At first, indeed, I did\\nnot feel that natural awe, which the _Yahoos_ and all other animals\\nbear toward them; but it grew upon me by degrees, much sooner than I\\nimagined, and was mingled with a respectful love and gratitude, that\\nthey would condescend to distinguish me from the rest of my species.\\n\\nWhen I thought of my family, my friends, my countrymen, or the human\\nrace in general, I considered them, as they really were, _Yahoos_ in\\nshape and disposition, perhaps a little more civilized, and qualified\\nwith the gift of speech; but making no other use of reason, than to\\nimprove and multiply those vices whereof their brethren in this country\\nhad only the share that nature allotted them. When I happened to behold\\nthe reflection of my own form in a lake or fountain, I turned away my\\nface in horror and detestation of myself, and could better endure the\\nsight of a common _Yahoo_ than of my own person. By conversing with the\\n_Houyhnhnms_, and looking upon them with delight, I fell to imitate\\ntheir gait and gesture, which is now grown into a habit; and my friends\\noften tell me, in a blunt way, “that I trot like a horse;” which,\\nhowever, I take for a great compliment. Neither shall I disown, that in\\nspeaking I am apt to fall into the voice and manner of the\\n_Houyhnhnms_, and hear myself ridiculed on that account, without the\\nleast mortification.\\n\\nIn the midst of all this happiness, and when I looked upon myself to be\\nfully settled for life, my master sent for me one morning a little\\nearlier than his usual hour. I observed by his countenance that he was\\nin some perplexity, and at a loss how to begin what he had to speak.\\nAfter a short silence, he told me, “he did not know how I would take\\nwhat he was going to say: that in the last general assembly, when the\\naffair of the _Yahoos_ was entered upon, the representatives had taken\\noffence at his keeping a _Yahoo_ (meaning myself) in his family, more\\nlike a _Houyhnhnm_ than a brute animal; that he was known frequently to\\nconverse with me, as if he could receive some advantage or pleasure in\\nmy company; that such a practice was not agreeable to reason or nature,\\nor a thing ever heard of before among them; the assembly did therefore\\nexhort him either to employ me like the rest of my species, or command\\nme to swim back to the place whence I came: that the first of these\\nexpedients was utterly rejected by all the _Houyhnhnms_ who had ever\\nseen me at his house or their own; for they alleged, that because I had\\nsome rudiments of reason, added to the natural pravity of those\\nanimals, it was to be feared I might be able to seduce them into the\\nwoody and mountainous parts of the country, and bring them in troops by\\nnight to destroy the _Houyhnhnms’_ cattle, as being naturally of the\\nravenous kind, and averse from labour.”\\n\\nMy master added, “that he was daily pressed by the _Houyhnhnms_ of the\\nneighbourhood to have the assembly’s exhortation executed, which he\\ncould not put off much longer. He doubted it would be impossible for me\\nto swim to another country; and therefore wished I would contrive some\\nsort of vehicle, resembling those I had described to him, that might\\ncarry me on the sea; in which work I should have the assistance of his\\nown servants, as well as those of his neighbours.” He concluded, “that\\nfor his own part, he could have been content to keep me in his service\\nas long as I lived; because he found I had cured myself of some bad\\nhabits and dispositions, by endeavouring, as far as my inferior nature\\nwas capable, to imitate the _Houyhnhnms_.”\\n\\nI should here observe to the reader, that a decree of the general\\nassembly in this country is expressed by the word _hnhloayn_, which\\nsignifies an exhortation, as near as I can render it; for they have no\\nconception how a rational creature can be compelled, but only advised,\\nor exhorted; because no person can disobey reason, without giving up\\nhis claim to be a rational creature.\\n\\nI was struck with the utmost grief and despair at my master’s\\ndiscourse; and being unable to support the agonies I was under, I fell\\ninto a swoon at his feet. When I came to myself, he told me “that he\\nconcluded I had been dead;” for these people are subject to no such\\nimbecilities of nature. I answered in a faint voice, “that death would\\nhave been too great a happiness; that although I could not blame the\\nassembly’s exhortation, or the urgency of his friends; yet, in my weak\\nand corrupt judgment, I thought it might consist with reason to have\\nbeen less rigorous; that I could not swim a league, and probably the\\nnearest land to theirs might be distant above a hundred: that many\\nmaterials, necessary for making a small vessel to carry me off, were\\nwholly wanting in this country; which, however, I would attempt, in\\nobedience and gratitude to his honour, although I concluded the thing\\nto be impossible, and therefore looked on myself as already devoted to\\ndestruction; that the certain prospect of an unnatural death was the\\nleast of my evils; for, supposing I should escape with life by some\\nstrange adventure, how could I think with temper of passing my days\\namong _Yahoos_, and relapsing into my old corruptions, for want of\\nexamples to lead and keep me within the paths of virtue? That I knew\\ntoo well upon what solid reasons all the determinations of the wise\\n_Houyhnhnms_ were founded, not to be shaken by arguments of mine, a\\nmiserable _Yahoo_; and therefore, after presenting him with my humble\\nthanks for the offer of his servants’ assistance in making a vessel,\\nand desiring a reasonable time for so difficult a work, I told him I\\nwould endeavour to preserve a wretched being; and if ever I returned to\\nEngland, was not without hopes of being useful to my own species, by\\ncelebrating the praises of the renowned _Houyhnhnms_, and proposing\\ntheir virtues to the imitation of mankind.”\\n\\nMy master, in a few words, made me a very gracious reply; allowed me\\nthe space of two months to finish my boat; and ordered the sorrel nag,\\nmy fellow-servant (for so, at this distance, I may presume to call\\nhim), to follow my instruction; because I told my master, “that his\\nhelp would be sufficient, and I knew he had a tenderness for me.”\\n\\nIn his company, my first business was to go to that part of the coast\\nwhere my rebellious crew had ordered me to be set on shore. I got upon\\na height, and looking on every side into the sea, fancied I saw a small\\nisland toward the north-east. I took out my pocket glass, and could\\nthen clearly distinguish it above five leagues off, as I computed; but\\nit appeared to the sorrel nag to be only a blue cloud: for as he had no\\nconception of any country beside his own, so he could not be as expert\\nin distinguishing remote objects at sea, as we who so much converse in\\nthat element.\\n\\nAfter I had discovered this island, I considered no further; but\\nresolved it should, if possible, be the first place of my banishment,\\nleaving the consequence to fortune.\\n\\nI returned home, and consulting with the sorrel nag, we went into a\\ncopse at some distance, where I with my knife, and he with a sharp\\nflint, fastened very artificially after their manner, to a wooden\\nhandle, cut down several oak wattles, about the thickness of a\\nwalking-staff, and some larger pieces. But I shall not trouble the\\nreader with a particular description of my own mechanics; let it\\nsuffice to say, that in six weeks time with the help of the sorrel nag,\\nwho performed the parts that required most labour, I finished a sort of\\nIndian canoe, but much larger, covering it with the skins of _Yahoos_,\\nwell stitched together with hempen threads of my own making. My sail\\nwas likewise composed of the skins of the same animal; but I made use\\nof the youngest I could get, the older being too tough and thick; and I\\nlikewise provided myself with four paddles. I laid in a stock of boiled\\nflesh, of rabbits and fowls, and took with me two vessels, one filled\\nwith milk and the other with water.\\n\\nI tried my canoe in a large pond, near my master’s house, and then\\ncorrected in it what was amiss; stopping all the chinks with _Yahoos’_\\ntallow, till I found it staunch, and able to bear me and my freight;\\nand, when it was as complete as I could possibly make it, I had it\\ndrawn on a carriage very gently by _Yahoos_ to the sea-side, under the\\nconduct of the sorrel nag and another servant.\\n\\nWhen all was ready, and the day came for my departure, I took leave of\\nmy master and lady and the whole family, my eyes flowing with tears,\\nand my heart quite sunk with grief. But his honour, out of curiosity,\\nand, perhaps, (if I may speak without vanity,) partly out of kindness,\\nwas determined to see me in my canoe, and got several of his\\nneighbouring friends to accompany him. I was forced to wait above an\\nhour for the tide; and then observing the wind very fortunately bearing\\ntoward the island to which I intended to steer my course, I took a\\nsecond leave of my master; but as I was going to prostrate myself to\\nkiss his hoof, he did me the honour to raise it gently to my mouth. I\\nam not ignorant how much I have been censured for mentioning this last\\nparticular. Detractors are pleased to think it improbable, that so\\nillustrious a person should descend to give so great a mark of\\ndistinction to a creature so inferior as I. Neither have I forgotten\\nhow apt some travellers are to boast of extraordinary favours they have\\nreceived. But, if these censurers were better acquainted with the noble\\nand courteous disposition of the _Houyhnhnms_, they would soon change\\ntheir opinion.\\n\\nI paid my respects to the rest of the _Houyhnhnms_ in his honour’s\\ncompany; then getting into my canoe, I pushed off from shore.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\nThe author’s dangerous voyage. He arrives at New Holland, hoping to\\nsettle there. Is wounded with an arrow by one of the natives. Is seized\\nand carried by force into a Portuguese ship. The great civilities of\\nthe captain. The author arrives at England.\\n\\n\\nI began this desperate voyage on February 15, 1714–15, at nine o’clock\\nin the morning. The wind was very favourable; however, I made use at\\nfirst only of my paddles; but considering I should soon be weary, and\\nthat the wind might chop about, I ventured to set up my little sail;\\nand thus, with the help of the tide, I went at the rate of a league and\\na half an hour, as near as I could guess. My master and his friends\\ncontinued on the shore till I was almost out of sight; and I often\\nheard the sorrel nag (who always loved me) crying out, “_Hnuy illa\\nnyha_, _majah Yahoo_;” “Take care of thyself, gentle _Yahoo_.”\\n\\nMy design was, if possible, to discover some small island uninhabited,\\nyet sufficient, by my labour, to furnish me with the necessaries of\\nlife, which I would have thought a greater happiness, than to be first\\nminister in the politest court of Europe; so horrible was the idea I\\nconceived of returning to live in the society, and under the government\\nof _Yahoos_. For in such a solitude as I desired, I could at least\\nenjoy my own thoughts, and reflect with delight on the virtues of those\\ninimitable _Houyhnhnms_, without an opportunity of degenerating into\\nthe vices and corruptions of my own species.\\n\\nThe reader may remember what I related, when my crew conspired against\\nme, and confined me to my cabin; how I continued there several weeks\\nwithout knowing what course we took; and when I was put ashore in the\\nlong-boat, how the sailors told me, with oaths, whether true or false,\\n“that they knew not in what part of the world we were.” However, I did\\nthen believe us to be about 10 degrees southward of the Cape of Good\\nHope, or about 45 degrees southern latitude, as I gathered from some\\ngeneral words I overheard among them, being I supposed to the\\nsouth-east in their intended voyage to Madagascar. And although this\\nwere little better than conjecture, yet I resolved to steer my course\\neastward, hoping to reach the south-west coast of New Holland, and\\nperhaps some such island as I desired lying westward of it. The wind\\nwas full west, and by six in the evening I computed I had gone eastward\\nat least eighteen leagues; when I spied a very small island about half\\na league off, which I soon reached. It was nothing but a rock, with one\\ncreek naturally arched by the force of tempests. Here I put in my\\ncanoe, and climbing a part of the rock, I could plainly discover land\\nto the east, extending from south to north. I lay all night in my\\ncanoe; and repeating my voyage early in the morning, I arrived in seven\\nhours to the south-east point of New Holland. This confirmed me in the\\nopinion I have long entertained, that the maps and charts place this\\ncountry at least three degrees more to the east than it really is;\\nwhich thought I communicated many years ago to my worthy friend, Mr.\\nHerman Moll, and gave him my reasons for it, although he has rather\\nchosen to follow other authors.\\n\\nI saw no inhabitants in the place where I landed, and being unarmed, I\\nwas afraid of venturing far into the country. I found some shellfish on\\nthe shore, and ate them raw, not daring to kindle a fire, for fear of\\nbeing discovered by the natives. I continued three days feeding on\\noysters and limpets, to save my own provisions; and I fortunately found\\na brook of excellent water, which gave me great relief.\\n\\nOn the fourth day, venturing out early a little too far, I saw twenty\\nor thirty natives upon a height not above five hundred yards from me.\\nThey were stark naked, men, women, and children, round a fire, as I\\ncould discover by the smoke. One of them spied me, and gave notice to\\nthe rest; five of them advanced toward me, leaving the women and\\nchildren at the fire. I made what haste I could to the shore, and,\\ngetting into my canoe, shoved off: the savages, observing me retreat,\\nran after me; and before I could get far enough into the sea,\\ndischarged an arrow which wounded me deeply on the inside of my left\\nknee: I shall carry the mark to my grave. I apprehended the arrow might\\nbe poisoned, and paddling out of the reach of their darts (being a calm\\nday), I made a shift to suck the wound, and dress it as well as I\\ncould.\\n\\nI was at a loss what to do, for I durst not return to the same\\nlanding-place, but stood to the north, and was forced to paddle, for\\nthe wind, though very gentle, was against me, blowing north-west. As I\\nwas looking about for a secure landing-place, I saw a sail to the\\nnorth-north-east, which appearing every minute more visible, I was in\\nsome doubt whether I should wait for them or not; but at last my\\ndetestation of the _Yahoo_ race prevailed: and turning my canoe, I\\nsailed and paddled together to the south, and got into the same creek\\nwhence I set out in the morning, choosing rather to trust myself among\\nthese barbarians, than live with European _Yahoos_. I drew up my canoe\\nas close as I could to the shore, and hid myself behind a stone by the\\nlittle brook, which, as I have already said, was excellent water.\\n\\nThe ship came within half a league of this creek, and sent her\\nlong-boat with vessels to take in fresh water (for the place, it seems,\\nwas very well known); but I did not observe it, till the boat was\\nalmost on shore; and it was too late to seek another hiding-place. The\\nseamen at their landing observed my canoe, and rummaging it all over,\\neasily conjectured that the owner could not be far off. Four of them,\\nwell armed, searched every cranny and lurking-hole, till at last they\\nfound me flat on my face behind the stone. They gazed awhile in\\nadmiration at my strange uncouth dress; my coat made of skins, my\\nwooden-soled shoes, and my furred stockings; whence, however, they\\nconcluded, I was not a native of the place, who all go naked. One of\\nthe seamen, in Portuguese, bid me rise, and asked who I was. I\\nunderstood that language very well, and getting upon my feet, said, “I\\nwas a poor _Yahoo_ banished from the _Houyhnhnms_, and desired they\\nwould please to let me depart.” They admired to hear me answer them in\\ntheir own tongue, and saw by my complexion I must be a European; but\\nwere at a loss to know what I meant by _Yahoos_ and _Houyhnhnms_; and\\nat the same time fell a-laughing at my strange tone in speaking, which\\nresembled the neighing of a horse. I trembled all the while betwixt\\nfear and hatred. I again desired leave to depart, and was gently moving\\nto my canoe; but they laid hold of me, desiring to know, “what country\\nI was of? whence I came?” with many other questions. I told them “I was\\nborn in England, whence I came about five years ago, and then their\\ncountry and ours were at peace. I therefore hoped they would not treat\\nme as an enemy, since I meant them no harm, but was a poor _Yahoo_\\nseeking some desolate place where to pass the remainder of his\\nunfortunate life.”\\n\\nWhen they began to talk, I thought I never heard or saw any thing more\\nunnatural; for it appeared to me as monstrous as if a dog or a cow\\nshould speak in England, or a _Yahoo_ in _Houyhnhnmland_. The honest\\nPortuguese were equally amazed at my strange dress, and the odd manner\\nof delivering my words, which, however, they understood very well. They\\nspoke to me with great humanity, and said, “they were sure the captain\\nwould carry me _gratis_ to Lisbon, whence I might return to my own\\ncountry; that two of the seamen would go back to the ship, inform the\\ncaptain of what they had seen, and receive his orders; in the mean\\ntime, unless I would give my solemn oath not to fly, they would secure\\nme by force. I thought it best to comply with their proposal. They were\\nvery curious to know my story, but I gave them very little\\nsatisfaction, and they all conjectured that my misfortunes had impaired\\nmy reason. In two hours the boat, which went laden with vessels of\\nwater, returned, with the captain’s command to fetch me on board. I\\nfell on my knees to preserve my liberty; but all was in vain; and the\\nmen, having tied me with cords, heaved me into the boat, whence I was\\ntaken into the ship, and thence into the captain’s cabin.\\n\\nHis name was Pedro de Mendez; he was a very courteous and generous\\nperson. He entreated me to give some account of myself, and desired to\\nknow what I would eat or drink; said, “I should be used as well as\\nhimself;” and spoke so many obliging things, that I wondered to find\\nsuch civilities from a _Yahoo_. However, I remained silent and sullen;\\nI was ready to faint at the very smell of him and his men. At last I\\ndesired something to eat out of my own canoe; but he ordered me a\\nchicken, and some excellent wine, and then directed that I should be\\nput to bed in a very clean cabin. I would not undress myself, but lay\\non the bed-clothes, and in half an hour stole out, when I thought the\\ncrew was at dinner, and getting to the side of the ship, was going to\\nleap into the sea, and swim for my life, rather than continue among\\n_Yahoos_. But one of the seamen prevented me, and having informed the\\ncaptain, I was chained to my cabin.\\n\\nAfter dinner, Don Pedro came to me, and desired to know my reason for\\nso desperate an attempt; assured me, “he only meant to do me all the\\nservice he was able;” and spoke so very movingly, that at last I\\ndescended to treat him like an animal which had some little portion of\\nreason. I gave him a very short relation of my voyage; of the\\nconspiracy against me by my own men; of the country where they set me\\non shore, and of my five years residence there. All which he looked\\nupon as if it were a dream or a vision; whereat I took great offence;\\nfor I had quite forgot the faculty of lying, so peculiar to _Yahoos_,\\nin all countries where they preside, and, consequently, their\\ndisposition of suspecting truth in others of their own species. I asked\\nhim, “whether it were the custom in his country to say the thing which\\nwas not?” I assured him, “I had almost forgot what he meant by\\nfalsehood, and if I had lived a thousand years in _Houyhnhnmland_, I\\nshould never have heard a lie from the meanest servant; that I was\\naltogether indifferent whether he believed me or not; but, however, in\\nreturn for his favours, I would give so much allowance to the\\ncorruption of his nature, as to answer any objection he would please to\\nmake, and then he might easily discover the truth.”\\n\\nThe captain, a wise man, after many endeavours to catch me tripping in\\nsome part of my story, at last began to have a better opinion of my\\nveracity. But he added, “that since I professed so inviolable an\\nattachment to truth, I must give him my word and honour to bear him\\ncompany in this voyage, without attempting any thing against my life;\\nor else he would continue me a prisoner till we arrived at Lisbon.” I\\ngave him the promise he required; but at the same time protested, “that\\nI would suffer the greatest hardships, rather than return to live among\\n_Yahoos_.”\\n\\nOur voyage passed without any considerable accident. In gratitude to\\nthe captain, I sometimes sat with him, at his earnest request, and\\nstrove to conceal my antipathy against humankind, although it often\\nbroke out; which he suffered to pass without observation. But the\\ngreatest part of the day I confined myself to my cabin, to avoid seeing\\nany of the crew. The captain had often entreated me to strip myself of\\nmy savage dress, and offered to lend me the best suit of clothes he\\nhad. This I would not be prevailed on to accept, abhorring to cover\\nmyself with any thing that had been on the back of a _Yahoo_. I only\\ndesired he would lend me two clean shirts, which, having been washed\\nsince he wore them, I believed would not so much defile me. These I\\nchanged every second day, and washed them myself.\\n\\nWe arrived at Lisbon, Nov. 5, 1715. At our landing, the captain forced\\nme to cover myself with his cloak, to prevent the rabble from crowding\\nabout me. I was conveyed to his own house; and at my earnest request he\\nled me up to the highest room backwards. I conjured him “to conceal\\nfrom all persons what I had told him of the _Houyhnhnms_; because the\\nleast hint of such a story would not only draw numbers of people to see\\nme, but probably put me in danger of being imprisoned, or burnt by the\\nInquisition.” The captain persuaded me to accept a suit of clothes\\nnewly made; but I would not suffer the tailor to take my measure;\\nhowever, Don Pedro being almost of my size, they fitted me well enough.\\nHe accoutred me with other necessaries, all new, which I aired for\\ntwenty-four hours before I would use them.\\n\\nThe captain had no wife, nor above three servants, none of which were\\nsuffered to attend at meals; and his whole deportment was so obliging,\\nadded to very good human understanding, that I really began to tolerate\\nhis company. He gained so far upon me, that I ventured to look out of\\nthe back window. By degrees I was brought into another room, whence I\\npeeped into the street, but drew my head back in a fright. In a week’s\\ntime he seduced me down to the door. I found my terror gradually\\nlessened, but my hatred and contempt seemed to increase. I was at last\\nbold enough to walk the street in his company, but kept my nose well\\nstopped with rue, or sometimes with tobacco.\\n\\nIn ten days, Don Pedro, to whom I had given some account of my domestic\\naffairs, put it upon me, as a matter of honour and conscience, “that I\\nought to return to my native country, and live at home with my wife and\\nchildren.” He told me, “there was an English ship in the port just\\nready to sail, and he would furnish me with all things necessary.” It\\nwould be tedious to repeat his arguments, and my contradictions. He\\nsaid, “it was altogether impossible to find such a solitary island as I\\ndesired to live in; but I might command in my own house, and pass my\\ntime in a manner as recluse as I pleased.”\\n\\nI complied at last, finding I could not do better. I left Lisbon the\\n24th day of November, in an English merchantman, but who was the master\\nI never inquired. Don Pedro accompanied me to the ship, and lent me\\ntwenty pounds. He took kind leave of me, and embraced me at parting,\\nwhich I bore as well as I could. During this last voyage I had no\\ncommerce with the master or any of his men; but, pretending I was sick,\\nkept close in my cabin. On the fifth of December, 1715, we cast anchor\\nin the Downs, about nine in the morning, and at three in the afternoon\\nI got safe to my house at Rotherhith. [546]\\n\\nMy wife and family received me with great surprise and joy, because\\nthey concluded me certainly dead; but I must freely confess the sight\\nof them filled me only with hatred, disgust, and contempt; and the\\nmore, by reflecting on the near alliance I had to them. For although,\\nsince my unfortunate exile from the _Houyhnhnm_ country, I had\\ncompelled myself to tolerate the sight of _Yahoos_, and to converse\\nwith Don Pedro de Mendez, yet my memory and imagination were\\nperpetually filled with the virtues and ideas of those exalted\\n_Houyhnhnms_. And when I began to consider that, by copulating with one\\nof the _Yahoo_ species I had become a parent of more, it struck me with\\nthe utmost shame, confusion, and horror.\\n\\nAs soon as I entered the house, my wife took me in her arms, and kissed\\nme; at which, having not been used to the touch of that odious animal\\nfor so many years, I fell into a swoon for almost an hour. At the time\\nI am writing, it is five years since my last return to England. During\\nthe first year, I could not endure my wife or children in my presence;\\nthe very smell of them was intolerable; much less could I suffer them\\nto eat in the same room. To this hour they dare not presume to touch my\\nbread, or drink out of the same cup, neither was I ever able to let one\\nof them take me by the hand. The first money I laid out was to buy two\\nyoung stone-horses, which I keep in a good stable; and next to them,\\nthe groom is my greatest favourite, for I feel my spirits revived by\\nthe smell he contracts in the stable. My horses understand me tolerably\\nwell; I converse with them at least four hours every day. They are\\nstrangers to bridle or saddle; they live in great amity with me and\\nfriendship to each other.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\n\\nThe author’s veracity. His design in publishing this work. His censure\\nof those travellers who swerve from the truth. The author clears\\nhimself from any sinister ends in writing. An objection answered. The\\nmethod of planting colonies. His native country commended. The right of\\nthe crown to those countries described by the author is justified. The\\ndifficulty of conquering them. The author takes his last leave of the\\nreader; proposes his manner of living for the future; gives good\\nadvice, and concludes.\\n\\n\\nThus, gentle reader, I have given thee a faithful history of my travels\\nfor sixteen years and above seven months: wherein I have not been so\\nstudious of ornament as of truth. I could, perhaps, like others, have\\nastonished thee with strange improbable tales; but I rather chose to\\nrelate plain matter of fact, in the simplest manner and style; because\\nmy principal design was to inform, and not to amuse thee.\\n\\nIt is easy for us who travel into remote countries, which are seldom\\nvisited by Englishmen or other Europeans, to form descriptions of\\nwonderful animals both at sea and land. Whereas a traveller’s chief aim\\nshould be to make men wiser and better, and to improve their minds by\\nthe bad, as well as good, example of what they deliver concerning\\nforeign places.\\n\\nI could heartily wish a law was enacted, that every traveller, before\\nhe were permitted to publish his voyages, should be obliged to make\\noath before the Lord High Chancellor, that all he intended to print was\\nabsolutely true to the best of his knowledge; for then the world would\\nno longer be deceived, as it usually is, while some writers, to make\\ntheir works pass the better upon the public, impose the grossest\\nfalsities on the unwary reader. I have perused several books of travels\\nwith great delight in my younger days; but having since gone over most\\nparts of the globe, and been able to contradict many fabulous accounts\\nfrom my own observation, it has given me a great disgust against this\\npart of reading, and some indignation to see the credulity of mankind\\nso impudently abused. Therefore, since my acquaintance were pleased to\\nthink my poor endeavours might not be unacceptable to my country, I\\nimposed on myself, as a maxim never to be swerved from, that I would\\nstrictly adhere to truth; neither indeed can I be ever under the least\\ntemptation to vary from it, while I retain in my mind the lectures and\\nexample of my noble master and the other illustrious _Houyhnhnms_ of\\nwhom I had so long the honour to be an humble hearer.\\n\\n\\n_—Nec si miserum Fortuna Sinonem_\\n\\n_Finxit_, _vanum etiam_, _mendacemque improba finget_.\\n\\nI know very well, how little reputation is to be got by writings which\\nrequire neither genius nor learning, nor indeed any other talent,\\nexcept a good memory, or an exact journal. I know likewise, that\\nwriters of travels, like dictionary-makers, are sunk into oblivion by\\nthe weight and bulk of those who come last, and therefore lie\\nuppermost. And it is highly probable, that such travellers, who shall\\nhereafter visit the countries described in this work of mine, may, by\\ndetecting my errors (if there be any), and adding many new discoveries\\nof their own, jostle me out of vogue, and stand in my place, making the\\nworld forget that ever I was an author. This indeed would be too great\\na mortification, if I wrote for fame: but as my sole intention was the\\npublic good, I cannot be altogether disappointed. For who can read of\\nthe virtues I have mentioned in the glorious _Houyhnhnms_, without\\nbeing ashamed of his own vices, when he considers himself as the\\nreasoning, governing animal of his country? I shall say nothing of\\nthose remote nations where _Yahoos_ preside; among which the least\\ncorrupted are the _Brobdingnagians_; whose wise maxims in morality and\\ngovernment it would be our happiness to observe. But I forbear\\ndescanting further, and rather leave the judicious reader to his own\\nremarks and application.\\n\\nI am not a little pleased that this work of mine can possibly meet with\\nno censurers: for what objections can be made against a writer, who\\nrelates only plain facts, that happened in such distant countries,\\nwhere we have not the least interest, with respect either to trade or\\nnegotiations? I have carefully avoided every fault with which common\\nwriters of travels are often too justly charged. Besides, I meddle not\\nthe least with any party, but write without passion, prejudice, or\\nill-will against any man, or number of men, whatsoever. I write for the\\nnoblest end, to inform and instruct mankind; over whom I may, without\\nbreach of modesty, pretend to some superiority, from the advantages I\\nreceived by conversing so long among the most accomplished\\n_Houyhnhnms_. I write without any view to profit or praise. I never\\nsuffer a word to pass that may look like reflection, or possibly give\\nthe least offence, even to those who are most ready to take it. So that\\nI hope I may with justice pronounce myself an author perfectly\\nblameless; against whom the tribes of Answerers, Considerers,\\nObservers, Reflectors, Detectors, Remarkers, will never be able to find\\nmatter for exercising their talents.\\n\\nI confess, it was whispered to me, “that I was bound in duty, as a\\nsubject of England, to have given in a memorial to a secretary of state\\nat my first coming over; because, whatever lands are discovered by a\\nsubject belong to the crown.” But I doubt whether our conquests in the\\ncountries I treat of would be as easy as those of Ferdinando Cortez\\nover the naked Americans. The _Lilliputians_, I think, are hardly worth\\nthe charge of a fleet and army to reduce them; and I question whether\\nit might be prudent or safe to attempt the _Brobdingnagians_; or\\nwhether an English army would be much at their ease with the Flying\\nIsland over their heads. The _Houyhnhnms_ indeed appear not to be so\\nwell prepared for war, a science to which they are perfect strangers,\\nand especially against missive weapons. However, supposing myself to be\\na minister of state, I could never give my advice for invading them.\\nTheir prudence, unanimity, unacquaintedness with fear, and their love\\nof their country, would amply supply all defects in the military art.\\nImagine twenty thousand of them breaking into the midst of an European\\narmy, confounding the ranks, overturning the carriages, battering the\\nwarriors’ faces into mummy by terrible yerks from their hinder hoofs.\\nFor they would well deserve the character given to Augustus,\\n_Recalcitrat undique tutus_. But, instead of proposals for conquering\\nthat magnanimous nation, I rather wish they were in a capacity, or\\ndisposition, to send a sufficient number of their inhabitants for\\ncivilizing Europe, by teaching us the first principles of honour,\\njustice, truth, temperance, public spirit, fortitude, chastity,\\nfriendship, benevolence, and fidelity. The names of all which virtues\\nare still retained among us in most languages, and are to be met with\\nin modern, as well as ancient authors; which I am able to assert from\\nmy own small reading.\\n\\nBut I had another reason, which made me less forward to enlarge his\\nmajesty’s dominions by my discoveries. To say the truth, I had\\nconceived a few scruples with relation to the distributive justice of\\nprinces upon those occasions. For instance, a crew of pirates are\\ndriven by a storm they know not whither; at length a boy discovers land\\nfrom the topmast; they go on shore to rob and plunder, they see a\\nharmless people, are entertained with kindness; they give the country a\\nnew name; they take formal possession of it for their king; they set up\\na rotten plank, or a stone, for a memorial; they murder two or three\\ndozen of the natives, bring away a couple more, by force, for a sample;\\nreturn home, and get their pardon. Here commences a new dominion\\nacquired with a title by divine right. Ships are sent with the first\\nopportunity; the natives driven out or destroyed; their princes\\ntortured to discover their gold; a free license given to all acts of\\ninhumanity and lust, the earth reeking with the blood of its\\ninhabitants: and this execrable crew of butchers, employed in so pious\\nan expedition, is a modern colony, sent to convert and civilize an\\nidolatrous and barbarous people!\\n\\nBut this description, I confess, does by no means affect the British\\nnation, who may be an example to the whole world for their wisdom,\\ncare, and justice in planting colonies; their liberal endowments for\\nthe advancement of religion and learning; their choice of devout and\\nable pastors to propagate Christianity; their caution in stocking their\\nprovinces with people of sober lives and conversations from this the\\nmother kingdom; their strict regard to the distribution of justice, in\\nsupplying the civil administration through all their colonies with\\nofficers of the greatest abilities, utter strangers to corruption; and,\\nto crown all, by sending the most vigilant and virtuous governors, who\\nhave no other views than the happiness of the people over whom they\\npreside, and the honour of the king their master.\\n\\nBut as those countries which I have described do not appear to have any\\ndesire of being conquered and enslaved, murdered or driven out by\\ncolonies, nor abound either in gold, silver, sugar, or tobacco, I did\\nhumbly conceive, they were by no means proper objects of our zeal, our\\nvalour, or our interest. However, if those whom it more concerns think\\nfit to be of another opinion, I am ready to depose, when I shall be\\nlawfully called, that no European did ever visit those countries before\\nme. I mean, if the inhabitants ought to be believed, unless a dispute\\nmay arise concerning the two _Yahoos_, said to have been seen many\\nyears ago upon a mountain in _Houyhnhnmland_, from whence the opinion\\nis, that the race of those brutes hath descended; and these, for\\nanything I know, may have been English, which indeed I was apt to\\nsuspect from the lineaments of their posterity’s countenances, although\\nvery much defaced. But, how far that will go to make out a title, I\\nleave to the learned in colony-law.\\n\\nBut, as to the formality of taking possession in my sovereign’s name,\\nit never came once into my thoughts; and if it had, yet, as my affairs\\nthen stood, I should perhaps, in point of prudence and\\nself-preservation, have put it off to a better opportunity.\\n\\nHaving thus answered the only objection that can ever be raised against\\nme as a traveller, I here take a final leave of all my courteous\\nreaders, and return to enjoy my own speculations in my little garden at\\nRedriff; to apply those excellent lessons of virtue which I learned\\namong the _Houyhnhnms_; to instruct the _Yahoos_ of my own family, as\\nfar as I shall find them docible animals; to behold my figure often in\\na glass, and thus, if possible, habituate myself by time to tolerate\\nthe sight of a human creature; to lament the brutality to _Houyhnhnms_\\nin my own country, but always treat their persons with respect, for the\\nsake of my noble master, his family, his friends, and the whole\\n_Houyhnhnm_ race, whom these of ours have the honour to resemble in all\\ntheir lineaments, however their intellectuals came to degenerate.\\n\\nI began last week to permit my wife to sit at dinner with me, at the\\nfarthest end of a long table; and to answer (but with the utmost\\nbrevity) the few questions I asked her. Yet, the smell of a _Yahoo_\\ncontinuing very offensive, I always keep my nose well stopped with rue,\\nlavender, or tobacco leaves. And, although it be hard for a man late in\\nlife to remove old habits, I am not altogether out of hopes, in some\\ntime, to suffer a neighbour _Yahoo_ in my company, without the\\napprehensions I am yet under of his teeth or his claws.\\n\\nMy reconcilement to the _Yahoo_-kind in general might not be so\\ndifficult, if they would be content with those vices and follies only\\nwhich nature has entitled them to. I am not in the least provoked at\\nthe sight of a lawyer, a pickpocket, a colonel, a fool, a lord, a\\ngamester, a politician, a whoremonger, a physician, an evidence, a\\nsuborner, an attorney, a traitor, or the like; this is all according to\\nthe due course of things: but when I behold a lump of deformity and\\ndiseases, both in body and mind, smitten with pride, it immediately\\nbreaks all the measures of my patience; neither shall I be ever able to\\ncomprehend how such an animal, and such a vice, could tally together.\\nThe wise and virtuous _Houyhnhnms_, who abound in all excellences that\\ncan adorn a rational creature, have no name for this vice in their\\nlanguage, which has no terms to express any thing that is evil, except\\nthose whereby they describe the detestable qualities of their _Yahoos_,\\namong which they were not able to distinguish this of pride, for want\\nof thoroughly understanding human nature, as it shows itself in other\\ncountries where that animal presides. But I, who had more experience,\\ncould plainly observe some rudiments of it among the wild _Yahoos_.\\n\\n\\nBut the _Houyhnhnms_, who live under the government of reason, are no\\nmore proud of the good qualities they possess, than I should be for not\\nwanting a leg or an arm; which no man in his wits would boast of,\\nalthough he must be miserable without them. I dwell the longer upon\\nthis subject from the desire I have to make the society of an English\\n_Yahoo_ by any means not insupportable; and therefore I here entreat\\nthose who have any tincture of this absurd vice, that they will not\\npresume to come in my sight.\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n[301] A stang is a pole or perch; sixteen feet and a half.\\n\\n[330] An act of parliament has been since passed by which some breaches\\nof trust have been made capital.\\n\\n[454a] Britannia.—_Sir W.

At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste,\\nsomething eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which\\nnever found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these\\nsilent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in\\nthe acts of his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when he\\nwas alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the\\ntheatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had\\nan approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with\\nenvy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and\\nin any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. “I incline to\\nCain’s heresy,” he used to say quaintly: “I let my brother go to the\\ndevil in his own way.” In this character, it was frequently his fortune\\nto be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in\\nthe lives of downgoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came\\nabout his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.\\n\\nNo doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative\\nat the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar\\ncatholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept\\nhis friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that\\nwas the lawyer’s way. His friends were those of his own blood or those\\nwhom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the\\ngrowth of time, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt\\nthe bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman,\\nthe well-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for many, what\\nthese two could see in each other, or what subject they could find in\\ncommon. It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday\\nwalks, that they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail\\nwith obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two\\nmen put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief\\njewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but\\neven resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them\\nuninterrupted.\\n\\nIt chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a\\nby-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what is\\ncalled quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The\\ninhabitants were all doing well, it seemed, and all emulously hoping to\\ndo better still, and laying out the surplus of their gains in coquetry;\\nso that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of\\ninvitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday, when it\\nveiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage,\\nthe street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a fire\\nin a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished\\nbrasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught\\nand pleased the eye of the passenger.\\n\\nTwo doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was\\nbroken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain\\nsinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street. It\\nwas two storeys high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower\\nstorey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore\\nin every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence. The\\ndoor, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered\\nand distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on\\nthe panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried\\nhis knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had\\nappeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their\\nravages.\\n\\nMr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but\\nwhen they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and\\npointed.\\n\\n“Did you ever remark that door?” he asked; and when his companion had\\nreplied in the affirmative, “It is connected in my mind,” added he,\\n“with a very odd story.”\\n\\n“Indeed?” said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, “and what\\nwas that?”\\n\\n“Well, it was this way,” returned Mr. Enfield: “I was coming home from\\nsome place at the end of the world, about three o’clock of a black\\nwinter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was\\nliterally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all the\\nfolks asleep—street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession\\nand all as empty as a church—till at last I got into that state of mind\\nwhen a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a\\npoliceman. All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was\\nstumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe\\neight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross\\nstreet. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the\\ncorner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man\\ntrampled calmly over the child’s body and left her screaming on the\\nground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn’t\\nlike a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a few halloa,\\ntook to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where\\nthere was already quite a group about the screaming child. He was\\nperfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly\\nthat it brought out the sweat on me like running. The people who had\\nturned out were the girl’s own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for\\nwhom she had been sent, put in his appearance. Well, the child was not\\nmuch the worse, more frightened, according to the sawbones; and there\\nyou might have supposed would be an end to it. But there was one\\ncurious circumstance. I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first\\nsight. So had the child’s family, which was only natural. But the\\ndoctor’s case was what struck me. He was the usual cut and dry\\napothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh\\naccent and about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the\\nrest of us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that sawbones\\nturn sick and white with the desire to kill him. I knew what was in his\\nmind, just as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the\\nquestion, we did the next best. We told the man we could and would make\\nsuch a scandal out of this as should make his name stink from one end\\nof London to the other. If he had any friends or any credit, we\\nundertook that he should lose them. And all the time, as we were\\npitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we\\ncould for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw a circle of such\\nhateful faces; and there was the man in the middle, with a kind of\\nblack sneering coolness—frightened too, I could see that—but carrying\\nit off, sir, really like Satan. ‘If you choose to make capital out of\\nthis accident,’ said he, ‘I am naturally helpless. No gentleman but\\nwishes to avoid a scene,’ says he. ‘Name your figure.’ Well, we screwed\\nhim up to a hundred pounds for the child’s family; he would have\\nclearly liked to stick out; but there was something about the lot of us\\nthat meant mischief, and at last he struck. The next thing was to get\\nthe money; and where do you think he carried us but to that place with\\nthe door?—whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the\\nmatter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts’s,\\ndrawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can’t mention,\\nthough it’s one of the points of my story, but it was a name at least\\nvery well known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but the\\nsignature was good for more than that if it was only genuine. I took\\nthe liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business\\nlooked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into a\\ncellar door at four in the morning and come out with another man’s\\ncheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But he was quite easy and\\nsneering. ‘Set your mind at rest,’ says he, ‘I will stay with you till\\nthe banks open and cash the cheque myself.’ So we all set off, the\\ndoctor, and the child’s father, and our friend and myself, and passed\\nthe rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had\\nbreakfasted, went in a body to the bank. I gave in the cheque myself,\\nand said I had every reason to believe it was a forgery. Not a bit of\\nit. The cheque was genuine.”\\n\\n“Tut-tut!” said Mr. Utterson.\\n\\n“I see you feel as I do,” said Mr. Enfield. “Yes, it’s a bad story. For\\nmy man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really\\ndamnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of\\nthe proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of your\\nfellows who do what they call good. Blackmail, I suppose; an honest man\\npaying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth. Black Mail\\nHouse is what I call the place with the door, in consequence. Though\\neven that, you know, is far from explaining all,” he added, and with\\nthe words fell into a vein of musing.\\n\\nFrom this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly: “And\\nyou don’t know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?”\\n\\n“A likely place, isn’t it?” returned Mr. Enfield. “But I happen to have\\nnoticed his address; he lives in some square or other.”\\n\\n“And you never asked about the—place with the door?” said Mr. Utterson.\\n\\n“No, sir; I had a delicacy,” was the reply. “I feel very strongly about\\nputting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of\\njudgment. You start a question, and it’s like starting a stone. You sit\\nquietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone goes, starting others;\\nand presently some bland old bird (the last you would have thought of)\\nis knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have to\\nchange their name. No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks\\nlike Queer Street, the less I ask.”\\n\\n“A very good rule, too,” said the lawyer.\\n\\n“But I have studied the place for myself,” continued Mr. Enfield. “It\\nseems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes in or\\nout of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of my\\nadventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the first\\nfloor; none below; the windows are always shut but they’re clean. And\\nthen there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so somebody must\\nlive there. And yet it’s not so sure; for the buildings are so packed\\ntogether about the court, that it’s hard to say where one ends and\\nanother begins.”\\n\\nThe pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then “Enfield,”\\nsaid Mr. Utterson, “that’s a good rule of yours.”\\n\\n“Yes, I think it is,” returned Enfield.\\n\\n“But for all that,” continued the lawyer, “there’s one point I want to\\nask. I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child.”\\n\\n“Well,” said Mr. Enfield, “I can’t see what harm it would do. It was a\\nman of the name of Hyde.”\\n\\n“Hm,” said Mr. Utterson. “What sort of a man is he to see?”\\n\\n“He is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with his\\nappearance; something displeasing, something down-right detestable. I\\nnever saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must be\\ndeformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I\\ncouldn’t specify the point. He’s an extraordinary looking man, and yet\\nI really can name nothing out of the way. No, sir; I can make no hand\\nof it; I can’t describe him. And it’s not want of memory; for I declare\\nI can see him this moment.”\\n\\nMr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a\\nweight of consideration. “You are sure he used a key?” he inquired at\\nlast.\\n\\n“My dear sir...” began Enfield, surprised out of himself.\\n\\n“Yes, I know,” said Utterson; “I know it must seem strange. The fact\\nis, if I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is because I\\nknow it already. You see, Richard, your tale has gone home. If you have\\nbeen inexact in any point you had better correct it.”\\n\\n“I think you might have warned me,” returned the other with a touch of\\nsullenness. “But I have been pedantically exact, as you call it. The\\nfellow had a key; and what’s more, he has it still. I saw him use it\\nnot a week ago.”\\n\\nMr. Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young man\\npresently resumed. “Here is another lesson to say nothing,” said he. “I\\nam ashamed of my long tongue. Let us make a bargain never to refer to\\nthis again.”\\n\\n“With all my heart,” said the lawyer. “I shake hands on that, Richard.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSEARCH FOR MR. HYDE\\n\\nThat evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre\\nspirits and sat down to dinner without relish. It was his custom of a\\nSunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume of\\nsome dry divinity on his reading desk, until the clock of the\\nneighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would go\\nsoberly and gratefully to bed. On this night however, as soon as the\\ncloth was taken away, he took up a candle and went into his business\\nroom. There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it a\\ndocument endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll’s Will and sat down\\nwith a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was holograph, for\\nMr. Utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made, had\\nrefused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided\\nnot only that, in case of the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L.,\\nL.L.D., F.R.S., etc., all his possessions were to pass into the hands\\nof his “friend and benefactor Edward Hyde,” but that in case of Dr.\\nJekyll’s “disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding\\nthree calendar months,” the said Edward Hyde should step into the said\\nHenry Jekyll’s shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or\\nobligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the\\ndoctor’s household. This document had long been the lawyer’s eyesore.\\nIt offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and\\ncustomary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. And\\nhitherto it was his ignorance of Mr. Hyde that had swelled his\\nindignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was his knowledge. It was\\nalready bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could learn\\nno more. It was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestable\\nattributes; and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists that had so\\nlong baffled his eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite presentment\\nof a fiend.\\n\\n“I thought it was madness,” he said, as he replaced the obnoxious paper\\nin the safe, “and now I begin to fear it is disgrace.”\\n\\nWith that he blew out his candle, put on a greatcoat, and set forth in\\nthe direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of medicine, where his\\nfriend, the great Dr. Lanyon, had his house and received his crowding\\npatients. “If anyone knows, it will be Lanyon,” he had thought.\\n\\nThe solemn butler knew and welcomed him; he was subjected to no stage\\nof delay, but ushered direct from the door to the dining-room where Dr.\\nLanyon sat alone over his wine. This was a hearty, healthy, dapper,\\nred-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair prematurely white, and a\\nboisterous and decided manner. At sight of Mr. Utterson, he sprang up\\nfrom his chair and welcomed him with both hands. The geniality, as was\\nthe way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposed\\non genuine feeling. For these two were old friends, old mates both at\\nschool and college, both thorough respectors of themselves and of each\\nother, and what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed each\\nother’s company.\\n\\nAfter a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject which so\\ndisagreeably preoccupied his mind.\\n\\n“I suppose, Lanyon,” said he, “you and I must be the two oldest friends\\nthat Henry Jekyll has?”\\n\\n“I wish the friends were younger,” chuckled Dr. Lanyon. “But I suppose\\nwe are. And what of that? I see little of him now.”\\n\\n“Indeed?” said Utterson. “I thought you had a bond of common interest.”\\n\\n“We had,” was the reply. “But it is more than ten years since Henry\\nJekyll became too fanciful for me. He began to go wrong, wrong in mind;\\nand though of course I continue to take an interest in him for old\\nsake’s sake, as they say, I see and I have seen devilish little of the\\nman. Such unscientific balderdash,” added the doctor, flushing suddenly\\npurple, “would have estranged Damon and Pythias.”\\n\\nThis little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Utterson.\\n“They have only differed on some point of science,” he thought; and\\nbeing a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter of\\nconveyancing), he even added: “It is nothing worse than that!” He gave\\nhis friend a few seconds to recover his composure, and then approached\\nthe question he had come to put. “Did you ever come across a _protégé_\\nof his—one Hyde?” he asked.\\n\\n“Hyde?” repeated Lanyon. “No. Never heard of him. Since my time.”\\n\\nThat was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with\\nhim to the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and fro, until the\\nsmall hours of the morning began to grow large. It was a night of\\nlittle ease to his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness and besieged\\nby questions.\\n\\nSix o’clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently\\nnear to Mr. Utterson’s dwelling, and still he was digging at the\\nproblem. Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone;\\nbut now his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved; and as he\\nlay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained\\nroom, Mr. Enfield’s tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted\\npictures. He would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal\\ncity; then of the figure of a man walking swiftly; then of a child\\nrunning from the doctor’s; and then these met, and that human\\nJuggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams.\\nOr else he would see a room in a rich house, where his friend lay\\nasleep, dreaming and smiling at his dreams; and then the door of that\\nroom would be opened, the curtains of the bed plucked apart, the\\nsleeper recalled, and lo! there would stand by his side a figure to\\nwhom power was given, and even at that dead hour, he must rise and do\\nits bidding. The figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all\\nnight; and if at any time he dozed over, it was but to see it glide\\nmore stealthily through sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly and\\nstill the more swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of\\nlamplighted city, and at every street corner crush a child and leave\\nher screaming. And still the figure had no face by which he might know\\nit; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and\\nmelted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grew\\napace in the lawyer’s mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate,\\ncuriosity to behold the features of the real Mr. Hyde. If he could but\\nonce set eyes on him, he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps\\nroll altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well\\nexamined. He might see a reason for his friend’s strange preference or\\nbondage (call it which you please) and even for the startling clause of\\nthe will. At least it would be a face worth seeing: the face of a man\\nwho was without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show itself to\\nraise up, in the mind of the unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of\\nenduring hatred.\\n\\nFrom that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the\\nby-street of shops. In the morning before office hours, at noon when\\nbusiness was plenty and time scarce, at night under the face of the\\nfogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or\\nconcourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post.\\n\\n“If he be Mr. Hyde,” he had thought, “I shall be Mr. Seek.”\\n\\nAnd at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night; frost\\nin the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps,\\nunshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By\\nten o’clock, when the shops were closed, the by-street was very\\nsolitary and, in spite of the low growl of London from all round, very\\nsilent. Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses\\nwere clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of\\nthe approach of any passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson\\nhad been some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd light\\nfootstep drawing near. In the course of his nightly patrols, he had\\nlong grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of\\na single person, while he is still a great way off, suddenly spring out\\ndistinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet his attention\\nhad never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it was\\nwith a strong, superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into\\nthe entry of the court.\\n\\nThe steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as they\\nturned the end of the street. The lawyer, looking forth from the entry,\\ncould soon see what manner of man he had to deal with. He was small and\\nvery plainly dressed and the look of him, even at that distance, went\\nsomehow strongly against the watcher’s inclination. But he made\\nstraight for the door, crossing the roadway to save time; and as he\\ncame, he drew a key from his pocket like one approaching home.\\n\\nMr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed.\\n“Mr. Hyde, I think?”\\n\\nMr. Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath. But his fear\\nwas only momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in the face,\\nhe answered coolly enough: “That is my name. What do you want?”\\n\\n“I see you are going in,” returned the lawyer. “I am an old friend of\\nDr. Jekyll’s—Mr. Utterson of Gaunt Street—you must have heard of my\\nname; and meeting you so conveniently, I thought you might admit me.”\\n\\n“You will not find Dr. Jekyll; he is from home,” replied Mr. Hyde,\\nblowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up,\\n“How did you know me?” he asked.\\n\\n“On your side,” said Mr. Utterson “will you do me a favour?”\\n\\n“With pleasure,” replied the other. “What shall it be?”\\n\\n“Will you let me see your face?” asked the lawyer.\\n\\nMr. Hyde appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden\\nreflection, fronted about with an air of defiance; and the pair stared\\nat each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds. “Now I shall know you\\nagain,” said Mr. Utterson. “It may be useful.”\\n\\n“Yes,” returned Mr. Hyde, “it is as well we have met; and _à propos_,\\nyou should have my address.” And he gave a number of a street in Soho.\\n\\n“Good God!” thought Mr. Utterson, “can he, too, have been thinking of\\nthe will?” But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in\\nacknowledgment of the address.\\n\\n“And now,” said the other, “how did you know me?”\\n\\n“By description,” was the reply.\\n\\n“Whose description?”\\n\\n“We have common friends,” said Mr. Utterson.\\n\\n“Common friends,” echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely. “Who are they?”\\n\\n“Jekyll, for instance,” said the lawyer.\\n\\n“He never told you,” cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. “I did not\\nthink you would have lied.”\\n\\n“Come,” said Mr. Utterson, “that is not fitting language.”\\n\\nThe other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment, with\\nextraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and disappeared into\\nthe house.\\n\\nThe lawyer stood awhile when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture of\\ndisquietude. Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing every\\nstep or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mental\\nperplexity. The problem he was thus debating as he walked, was one of a\\nclass that is rarely solved. Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave an\\nimpression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had a\\ndispleasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of\\nmurderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky,\\nwhispering and somewhat broken voice; all these were points against\\nhim, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown\\ndisgust, loathing and fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him. “There\\nmust be something else,” said the perplexed gentleman. “There _is_\\nsomething more, if I could find a name for it. God bless me, the man\\nseems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say? or can it be\\nthe old story of Dr. Fell? or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul\\nthat thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent? The\\nlast, I think; for, O my poor old Harry Jekyll, if ever I read Satan’s\\nsignature upon a face, it is on that of your new friend.”\\n\\nRound the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient,\\nhandsome houses, now for the most part decayed from their high estate\\nand let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men;\\nmap-engravers, architects, shady lawyers and the agents of obscure\\nenterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was still\\noccupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great air of\\nwealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness except for\\nthe fanlight, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked. A well-dressed, elderly\\nservant opened the door.\\n\\n“Is Dr. Jekyll at home, Poole?” asked the lawyer.\\n\\n“I will see, Mr. Utterson,” said Poole, admitting the visitor, as he\\nspoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall paved with flags,\\nwarmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire,\\nand furnished with costly cabinets of oak. “Will you wait here by the\\nfire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the dining-room?”\\n\\n“Here, thank you,” said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on the\\ntall fender. This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a pet fancy\\nof his friend the doctor’s; and Utterson himself was wont to speak of\\nit as the pleasantest room in London. But tonight there was a shudder\\nin his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his memory; he felt (what\\nwas rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life; and in the gloom of\\nhis spirits, he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the\\nfirelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the\\nshadow on the roof. He was ashamed of his relief, when Poole presently\\nreturned to announce that Dr. Jekyll was gone out.\\n\\n“I saw Mr. Hyde go in by the old dissecting room, Poole,” he said. “Is\\nthat right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?”\\n\\n“Quite right, Mr. Utterson, sir,” replied the servant. “Mr. Hyde has a\\nkey.”\\n\\n“Your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man,\\nPoole,” resumed the other musingly.\\n\\n“Yes, sir, he does indeed,” said Poole. “We have all orders to obey\\nhim.”\\n\\n“I do not think I ever met Mr. Hyde?” asked Utterson.\\n\\n“O, dear no, sir. He never _dines_ here,” replied the butler. “Indeed\\nwe see very little of him on this side of the house; he mostly comes\\nand goes by the laboratory.”\\n\\n“Well, good-night, Poole.”\\n\\n“Good-night, Mr. Utterson.”\\n\\nAnd the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart. “Poor Harry\\nJekyll,” he thought, “my mind misgives me he is in deep waters! He was\\nwild when he was young; a long while ago to be sure; but in the law of\\nGod, there is no statute of limitations. Ay, it must be that; the ghost\\nof some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment\\ncoming, _pede claudo_, years after memory has forgotten and self-love\\ncondoned the fault.” And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded\\nawhile on his own past, groping in all the corners of memory, lest by\\nchance some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light\\nthere. His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of\\ntheir life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by\\nthe many ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and\\nfearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided.\\nAnd then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a spark of\\nhope. “This Master Hyde, if he were studied,” thought he, “must have\\nsecrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him; secrets compared\\nto which poor Jekyll’s worst would be like sunshine. Things cannot\\ncontinue as they are. It turns me cold to think of this creature\\nstealing like a thief to Harry’s bedside; poor Harry, what a wakening!\\nAnd the danger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the existence of the\\nwill, he may grow impatient to inherit. Ay, I must put my shoulders to\\nthe wheel—if Jekyll will but let me,” he added, “if Jekyll will only\\nlet me.” For once more he saw before his mind’s eye, as clear as\\ntransparency, the strange clauses of the will.\\n\\n\\n\\nDR. JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE\\n\\nA fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of\\nhis pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent,\\nreputable men and all judges of good wine; and Mr. Utterson so\\ncontrived that he remained behind after the others had departed. This\\nwas no new arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of\\ntimes. Where Utterson was liked, he was liked well. Hosts loved to\\ndetain the dry lawyer, when the light-hearted and loose-tongued had\\nalready their foot on the threshold; they liked to sit a while in his\\nunobtrusive company, practising for solitude, sobering their minds in\\nthe man’s rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety. To this\\nrule, Dr. Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite\\nside of the fire—a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with\\nsomething of a slyish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and\\nkindness—you could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr. Utterson\\na sincere and warm affection.\\n\\n“I have been wanting to speak to you, Jekyll,” began the latter. “You\\nknow that will of yours?”\\n\\nA close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful;\\nbut the doctor carried it off gaily. “My poor Utterson,” said he, “you\\nare unfortunate in such a client. I never saw a man so distressed as\\nyou were by my will; unless it were that hide-bound pedant, Lanyon, at\\nwhat he called my scientific heresies. O, I know he’s a good fellow—you\\nneedn’t frown—an excellent fellow, and I always mean to see more of\\nhim; but a hide-bound pedant for all that; an ignorant, blatant pedant.\\nI was never more disappointed in any man than Lanyon.”\\n\\n“You know I never approved of it,” pursued Utterson, ruthlessly\\ndisregarding the fresh topic.\\n\\n“My will? Yes, certainly, I know that,” said the doctor, a trifle\\nsharply. “You have told me so.”\\n\\n“Well, I tell you so again,” continued the lawyer. “I have been\\nlearning something of young Hyde.”\\n\\nThe large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and\\nthere came a blackness about his eyes. “I do not care to hear more,”\\nsaid he. “This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.”\\n\\n“What I heard was abominable,” said Utterson.\\n\\n“It can make no change. You do not understand my position,” returned\\nthe doctor, with a certain incoherency of manner. “I am painfully\\nsituated, Utterson; my position is a very strange—a very strange one.\\nIt is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.”\\n\\n“Jekyll,” said Utterson, “you know me: I am a man to be trusted. Make a\\nclean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get you\\nout of it.”\\n\\n“My good Utterson,” said the doctor, “this is very good of you, this is\\ndownright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in. I\\nbelieve you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before\\nmyself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn’t what you fancy;\\nit is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I\\nwill tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde.\\nI give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again; and I\\nwill just add one little word, Utterson, that I’m sure you’ll take in\\ngood part: this is a private matter, and I beg of you to let it sleep.”\\n\\nUtterson reflected a little, looking in the fire.\\n\\n“I have no doubt you are perfectly right,” he said at last, getting to\\nhis feet.\\n\\n“Well, but since we have touched upon this business, and for the last\\ntime I hope,” continued the doctor, “there is one point I should like\\nyou to understand. I have really a very great interest in poor Hyde. I\\nknow you have seen him; he told me so; and I fear he was rude. But I do\\nsincerely take a great, a very great interest in that young man; and if\\nI am taken away, Utterson, I wish you to promise me that you will bear\\nwith him and get his rights for him. I think you would, if you knew\\nall; and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise.”\\n\\n“I can’t pretend that I shall ever like him,” said the lawyer.\\n\\n“I don’t ask that,” pleaded Jekyll, laying his hand upon the other’s\\narm; “I only ask for justice; I only ask you to help him for my sake,\\nwhen I am no longer here.”\\n\\nUtterson heaved an irrepressible sigh. “Well,” said he, “I promise.”\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CAREW MURDER CASE\\n\\nNearly a year later, in the month of October, 18—, London was startled\\nby a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by\\nthe high position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A\\nmaid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone\\nupstairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled over the city in\\nthe small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the\\nlane, which the maid’s window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the\\nfull moon. It seems she was romantically given, for she sat down upon\\nher box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a\\ndream of musing. Never (she used to say, with streaming tears, when she\\nnarrated that experience), never had she felt more at peace with all\\nmen or thought more kindly of the world. And as she so sat she became\\naware of an aged beautiful gentleman with white hair, drawing near\\nalong the lane; and advancing to meet him, another and very small\\ngentleman, to whom at first she paid less attention. When they had come\\nwithin speech (which was just under the maid’s eyes) the older man\\nbowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness.\\nIt did not seem as if the subject of his address were of great\\nimportance; indeed, from his pointing, it sometimes appeared as if he\\nwere only inquiring his way; but the moon shone on his face as he\\nspoke, and the girl was pleased to watch it, it seemed to breathe such\\nan innocent and old-world kindness of disposition, yet with something\\nhigh too, as of a well-founded self-content. Presently her eye wandered\\nto the other, and she was surprised to recognise in him a certain Mr.\\nHyde, who had once visited her master and for whom she had conceived a\\ndislike. He had in his hand a heavy cane, with which he was trifling;\\nbut he answered never a word, and seemed to listen with an\\nill-contained impatience. And then all of a sudden he broke out in a\\ngreat flame of anger, stamping with his foot, brandishing the cane, and\\ncarrying on (as the maid described it) like a madman. The old gentleman\\ntook a step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle\\nhurt; and at that Mr. Hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to\\nthe earth. And next moment, with ape-like fury, he was trampling his\\nvictim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows, under which the\\nbones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway. At\\nthe horror of these sights and sounds, the maid fainted.\\n\\nIt was two o’clock when she came to herself and called for the police.\\nThe murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim in the middle\\nof the lane, incredibly mangled. The stick with which the deed had been\\ndone, although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood, had\\nbroken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty; and\\none splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter—the other,\\nwithout doubt, had been carried away by the murderer. A purse and gold\\nwatch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a\\nsealed and stamped envelope, which he had been probably carrying to the\\npost, and which bore the name and address of Mr. Utterson.\\n\\nThis was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before he was out of\\nbed; and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances, than\\nhe shot out a solemn lip. “I shall say nothing till I have seen the\\nbody,” said he; “this may be very serious. Have the kindness to wait\\nwhile I dress.” And with the same grave countenance he hurried through\\nhis breakfast and drove to the police station, whither the body had\\nbeen carried. As soon as he came into the cell, he nodded.\\n\\n“Yes,” said he, “I recognise him. I am sorry to say that this is Sir\\nDanvers Carew.”\\n\\n“Good God, sir,” exclaimed the officer, “is it possible?” And the next\\nmoment his eye lighted up with professional ambition. “This will make a\\ndeal of noise,” he said. “And perhaps you can help us to the man.” And\\nhe briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed the broken\\nstick.\\n\\nMr. Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when the\\nstick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and\\nbattered as it was, he recognised it for one that he had himself\\npresented many years before to Henry Jekyll.\\n\\n“Is this Mr. Hyde a person of small stature?” he inquired.\\n\\n“Particularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the maid\\ncalls him,” said the officer.\\n\\nMr. Utterson reflected; and then, raising his head, “If you will come\\nwith me in my cab,” he said, “I think I can take you to his house.”\\n\\nIt was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of the\\nseason. A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but the\\nwind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours; so\\nthat as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr. Utterson beheld a\\nmarvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight; for here it would be\\ndark like the back-end of evening; and there would be a glow of a rich,\\nlurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration; and here,\\nfor a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft of\\ndaylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths. The dismal\\nquarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses, with its muddy\\nways, and slatternly passengers, and its lamps, which had never been\\nextinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful\\nreinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer’s eyes, like a district\\nof some city in a nightmare. The thoughts of his mind, besides, were of\\nthe gloomiest dye; and when he glanced at the companion of his drive,\\nhe was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law’s\\nofficers, which may at times assail the most honest.\\n\\nAs the cab drew up before the address indicated, the fog lifted a\\nlittle and showed him a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French eating\\nhouse, a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads, many\\nragged children huddled in the doorways, and many women of many\\ndifferent nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a morning\\nglass; and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part,\\nas brown as umber, and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings.\\nThis was the home of Henry Jekyll’s favourite; of a man who was heir to\\na quarter of a million sterling.\\n\\nAn ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door. She had an\\nevil face, smoothed by hypocrisy: but her manners were excellent. Yes,\\nshe said, this was Mr. Hyde’s, but he was not at home; he had been in\\nthat night very late, but he had gone away again in less than an hour;\\nthere was nothing strange in that; his habits were very irregular, and\\nhe was often absent; for instance, it was nearly two months since she\\nhad seen him till yesterday.\\n\\n“Very well, then, we wish to see his rooms,” said the lawyer; and when\\nthe woman began to declare it was impossible, “I had better tell you\\nwho this person is,” he added. “This is Inspector Newcomen of Scotland\\nYard.”\\n\\nA flash of odious joy appeared upon the woman’s face. “Ah!” said she,\\n“he is in trouble! What has he done?”\\n\\nMr. Utterson and the inspector exchanged glances. “He don’t seem a very\\npopular character,” observed the latter. “And now, my good woman, just\\nlet me and this gentleman have a look about us.”\\n\\nIn the whole extent of the house, which but for the old woman remained\\notherwise empty, Mr. Hyde had only used a couple of rooms; but these\\nwere furnished with luxury and good taste. A closet was filled with\\nwine; the plate was of silver, the napery elegant; a good picture hung\\nupon the walls, a gift (as Utterson supposed) from Henry Jekyll, who\\nwas much of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of many plies and\\nagreeable in colour. At this moment, however, the rooms bore every mark\\nof having been recently and hurriedly ransacked; clothes lay about the\\nfloor, with their pockets inside out; lock-fast drawers stood open; and\\non the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes, as though many papers had\\nbeen burned. From these embers the inspector disinterred the butt end\\nof a green cheque book, which had resisted the action of the fire; the\\nother half of the stick was found behind the door; and as this clinched\\nhis suspicions, the officer declared himself delighted. A visit to the\\nbank, where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the\\nmurderer’s credit, completed his gratification.\\n\\n“You may depend upon it, sir,” he told Mr. Utterson: “I have him in my\\nhand. He must have lost his head, or he never would have left the stick\\nor, above all, burned the cheque book. Why, money’s life to the man. We\\nhave nothing to do but wait for him at the bank, and get out the\\nhandbills.”\\n\\nThis last, however, was not so easy of accomplishment; for Mr. Hyde had\\nnumbered few familiars—even the master of the servant maid had only\\nseen him twice; his family could nowhere be traced; he had never been\\nphotographed; and the few who could describe him differed widely, as\\ncommon observers will. Only on one point were they agreed; and that was\\nthe haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive\\nimpressed his beholders.\\n\\n\\n\\nINCIDENT OF THE LETTER\\n\\nIt was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Utterson found his way to Dr.\\nJekyll’s door, where he was at once admitted by Poole, and carried down\\nby the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden,\\nto the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or\\ndissecting rooms. The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a\\ncelebrated surgeon; and his own tastes being rather chemical than\\nanatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of\\nthe garden. It was the first time that the lawyer had been received in\\nthat part of his friend’s quarters; and he eyed the dingy, windowless\\nstructure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of\\nstrangeness as he crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager students\\nand now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical\\napparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing\\nstraw, and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At the\\nfurther end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red\\nbaize; and through this, Mr. Utterson was at last received into the\\ndoctor’s cabinet. It was a large room fitted round with glass presses,\\nfurnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and a business\\ntable, and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred\\nwith iron. The fire burned in the grate; a lamp was set lighted on the\\nchimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly; and\\nthere, close up to the warmth, sat Dr. Jekyll, looking deathly sick. He\\ndid not rise to meet his visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade him\\nwelcome in a changed voice.\\n\\n“And now,” said Mr. Utterson, as soon as Poole had left them, “you have\\nheard the news?”\\n\\nThe doctor shuddered. “They were crying it in the square,” he said. “I\\nheard them in my dining-room.”\\n\\n“One word,” said the lawyer. “Carew was my client, but so are you, and\\nI want to know what I am doing. You have not been mad enough to hide\\nthis fellow?”\\n\\n“Utterson, I swear to God,” cried the doctor, “I swear to God I will\\nnever set eyes on him again. I bind my honour to you that I am done\\nwith him in this world. It is all at an end. And indeed he does not\\nwant my help; you do not know him as I do; he is safe, he is quite\\nsafe; mark my words, he will never more be heard of.”\\n\\nThe lawyer listened gloomily; he did not like his friend’s feverish\\nmanner. “You seem pretty sure of him,” said he; “and for your sake, I\\nhope you may be right. If it came to a trial, your name might appear.”\\n\\n“I am quite sure of him,” replied Jekyll; “I have grounds for certainty\\nthat I cannot share with any one. But there is one thing on which you\\nmay advise me. I have—I have received a letter; and I am at a loss\\nwhether I should show it to the police. I should like to leave it in\\nyour hands, Utterson; you would judge wisely, I am sure; I have so\\ngreat a trust in you.”\\n\\n“You fear, I suppose, that it might lead to his detection?” asked the\\nlawyer.\\n\\n“No,” said the other. “I cannot say that I care what becomes of Hyde; I\\nam quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character, which this\\nhateful business has rather exposed.”\\n\\nUtterson ruminated awhile; he was surprised at his friend’s\\nselfishness, and yet relieved by it. “Well,” said he, at last, “let me\\nsee the letter.”\\n\\nThe letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed “Edward\\nHyde”: and it signified, briefly enough, that the writer’s benefactor,\\nDr. Jekyll, whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand\\ngenerosities, need labour under no alarm for his safety, as he had\\nmeans of escape on which he placed a sure dependence. The lawyer liked\\nthis letter well enough; it put a better colour on the intimacy than he\\nhad looked for; and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions.\\n\\n“Have you the envelope?” he asked.\\n\\n“I burned it,” replied Jekyll, “before I thought what I was about. But\\nit bore no postmark. The note was handed in.”\\n\\n“Shall I keep this and sleep upon it?” asked Utterson.\\n\\n“I wish you to judge for me entirely,” was the reply. “I have lost\\nconfidence in myself.”\\n\\n“Well, I shall consider,” returned the lawyer. “And now one word more:\\nit was Hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that\\ndisappearance?”\\n\\nThe doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness; he shut his mouth\\ntight and nodded.\\n\\n“I knew it,” said Utterson. “He meant to murder you. You had a fine\\nescape.”\\n\\n“I have had what is far more to the purpose,” returned the doctor\\nsolemnly: “I have had a lesson—O God, Utterson, what a lesson I have\\nhad!” And he covered his face for a moment with his hands.\\n\\nOn his way out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with Poole.\\n“By the bye,” said he, “there was a letter handed in to-day: what was\\nthe messenger like?” But Poole was positive nothing had come except by\\npost; “and only circulars by that,” he added.\\n\\nThis news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed. Plainly the\\nletter had come by the laboratory door; possibly, indeed, it had been\\nwritten in the cabinet; and if that were so, it must be differently\\njudged, and handled with the more caution. The newsboys, as he went,\\nwere crying themselves hoarse along the footways: “Special edition.\\nShocking murder of an M.P.” That was the funeral oration of one friend\\nand client; and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good\\nname of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal. It\\nwas, at least, a ticklish decision that he had to make; and\\nself-reliant as he was by habit, he began to cherish a longing for\\nadvice. It was not to be had directly; but perhaps, he thought, it\\nmight be fished for.\\n\\nPresently after, he sat on one side of his own hearth, with Mr. Guest,\\nhis head clerk, upon the other, and midway between, at a nicely\\ncalculated distance from the fire, a bottle of a particular old wine\\nthat had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his house. The fog\\nstill slept on the wing above the drowned city, where the lamps\\nglimmered like carbuncles; and through the muffle and smother of these\\nfallen clouds, the procession of the town’s life was still rolling in\\nthrough the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind. But the\\nroom was gay with firelight. In the bottle the acids were long ago\\nresolved; the imperial dye had softened with time, as the colour grows\\nricher in stained windows; and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on\\nhillside vineyards, was ready to be set free and to disperse the fogs\\nof London. Insensibly the lawyer melted. There was no man from whom he\\nkept fewer secrets than Mr. Guest; and he was not always sure that he\\nkept as many as he meant. Guest had often been on business to the\\ndoctor’s; he knew Poole; he could scarce have failed to hear of Mr.\\nHyde’s familiarity about the house; he might draw conclusions: was it\\nnot as well, then, that he should see a letter which put that mystery\\nto right? and above all since Guest, being a great student and critic\\nof handwriting, would consider the step natural and obliging? The\\nclerk, besides, was a man of counsel; he could scarce read so strange a\\ndocument without dropping a remark; and by that remark Mr. Utterson\\nmight shape his future course.\\n\\n“This is a sad business about Sir Danvers,” he said.\\n\\n“Yes, sir, indeed. It has elicited a great deal of public feeling,”\\nreturned Guest. “The man, of course, was mad.”\\n\\n“I should like to hear your views on that,” replied Utterson. “I have a\\ndocument here in his handwriting; it is between ourselves, for I scarce\\nknow what to do about it; it is an ugly business at the best. But there\\nit is; quite in your way: a murderer’s autograph.”\\n\\nGuest’s eyes brightened, and he sat down at once and studied it with\\npassion. “No sir,” he said: “not mad; but it is an odd hand.”\\n\\n“And by all accounts a very odd writer,” added the lawyer.\\n\\nJust then the servant entered with a note.\\n\\n“Is that from Dr. Jekyll, sir?” inquired the clerk. “I thought I knew\\nthe writing. Anything private, Mr. Utterson?”\\n\\n“Only an invitation to dinner. Why? Do you want to see it?”\\n\\n“One moment. I thank you, sir;” and the clerk laid the two sheets of\\npaper alongside and sedulously compared their contents. “Thank you,\\nsir,” he said at last, returning both; “it’s a very interesting\\nautograph.”\\n\\nThere was a pause, during which Mr. Utterson struggled with himself.\\n“Why did you compare them, Guest?” he inquired suddenly.\\n\\n“Well, sir,” returned the clerk, “there’s a rather singular\\nresemblance; the two hands are in many points identical: only\\ndifferently sloped.”\\n\\n“Rather quaint,” said Utterson.\\n\\n“It is, as you say, rather quaint,” returned Guest.\\n\\n“I wouldn’t speak of this note, you know,” said the master.\\n\\n“No, sir,” said the clerk. “I understand.”\\n\\nBut no sooner was Mr. Utterson alone that night, than he locked the\\nnote into his safe, where it reposed from that time forward. “What!” he\\nthought. “Henry Jekyll forge for a murderer!” And his blood ran cold in\\nhis veins.\\n\\n\\n\\nINCIDENT OF DR. LANYON\\n\\nTime ran on; thousands of pounds were offered in reward, for the death\\nof Sir Danvers was resented as a public injury; but Mr. Hyde had\\ndisappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never\\nexisted. Much of his past was unearthed, indeed, and all disreputable:\\ntales came out of the man’s cruelty, at once so callous and violent; of\\nhis vile life, of his strange associates, of the hatred that seemed to\\nhave surrounded his career; but of his present whereabouts, not a\\nwhisper. From the time he had left the house in Soho on the morning of\\nthe murder, he was simply blotted out; and gradually, as time drew on,\\nMr. Utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm, and to\\ngrow more at quiet with himself. The death of Sir Danvers was, to his\\nway of thinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of Mr. Hyde.\\nNow that that evil influence had been withdrawn, a new life began for\\nDr. Jekyll. He came out of his seclusion, renewed relations with his\\nfriends, became once more their familiar guest and entertainer; and\\nwhilst he had always been known for charities, he was now no less\\ndistinguished for religion. He was busy, he was much in the open air,\\nhe did good; his face seemed to open and brighten, as if with an inward\\nconsciousness of service; and for more than two months, the doctor was\\nat peace.\\n\\nOn the 8th of January Utterson had dined at the doctor’s with a small\\nparty; Lanyon had been there; and the face of the host had looked from\\none to the other as in the old days when the trio were inseparable\\nfriends. On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door was shut against\\nthe lawyer. “The doctor was confined to the house,” Poole said, “and\\nsaw no one.” On the 15th, he tried again, and was again refused; and\\nhaving now been used for the last two months to see his friend almost\\ndaily, he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits. The\\nfifth night he had in Guest to dine with him; and the sixth he betook\\nhimself to Dr. Lanyon’s.\\n\\nThere at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in, he\\nwas shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor’s\\nappearance. He had his death-warrant written legibly upon his face. The\\nrosy man had grown pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was visibly\\nbalder and older; and yet it was not so much these tokens of a swift\\nphysical decay that arrested the lawyer’s notice, as a look in the eye\\nand quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deep-seated terror\\nof the mind. It was unlikely that the doctor should fear death; and yet\\nthat was what Utterson was tempted to suspect. “Yes,” he thought; “he\\nis a doctor, he must know his own state and that his days are counted;\\nand the knowledge is more than he can bear.” And yet when Utterson\\nremarked on his ill looks, it was with an air of great firmness that\\nLanyon declared himself a doomed man.\\n\\n“I have had a shock,” he said, “and I shall never recover. It is a\\nquestion of weeks. Well, life has been pleasant; I liked it; yes, sir,\\nI used to like it. I sometimes think if we knew all, we should be more\\nglad to get away.”\\n\\n“Jekyll is ill, too,” observed Utterson. “Have you seen him?”\\n\\nBut Lanyon’s face changed, and he held up a trembling hand. “I wish to\\nsee or hear no more of Dr. Jekyll,” he said in a loud, unsteady voice.\\n“I am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any\\nallusion to one whom I regard as dead.”\\n\\n“Tut, tut!” said Mr. Utterson; and then after a considerable pause,\\n“Can’t I do anything?” he inquired. “We are three very old friends,\\nLanyon; we shall not live to make others.”\\n\\n“Nothing can be done,” returned Lanyon; “ask himself.”\\n\\n“He will not see me,” said the lawyer.\\n\\n“I am not surprised at that,” was the reply. “Some day, Utterson, after\\nI am dead, you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this. I\\ncannot tell you. And in the meantime, if you can sit and talk with me\\nof other things, for God’s sake, stay and do so; but if you cannot keep\\nclear of this accursed topic, then in God’s name, go, for I cannot bear\\nit.”\\n\\nAs soon as he got home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll,\\ncomplaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of\\nthis unhappy break with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a long\\nanswer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly mysterious\\nin drift. The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable. “I do not blame our\\nold friend,” Jekyll wrote, “but I share his view that we must never\\nmeet. I mean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion; you\\nmust not be surprised, nor must you doubt my friendship, if my door is\\noften shut even to you. You must suffer me to go my own dark way. I\\nhave brought on myself a punishment and a danger that I cannot name. If\\nI am the chief of sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also. I could\\nnot think that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors\\nso unmanning; and you can do but one thing, Utterson, to lighten this\\ndestiny, and that is to respect my silence.” Utterson was amazed; the\\ndark influence of Hyde had been withdrawn, the doctor had returned to\\nhis old tasks and amities; a week ago, the prospect had smiled with\\nevery promise of a cheerful and an honoured age; and now in a moment,\\nfriendship, and peace of mind, and the whole tenor of his life were\\nwrecked. So great and unprepared a change pointed to madness; but in\\nview of Lanyon’s manner and words, there must lie for it some deeper\\nground.\\n\\nA week afterwards Dr. Lanyon took to his bed, and in something less\\nthan a fortnight he was dead. The night after the funeral, at which he\\nhad been sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of his business room,\\nand sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out and set\\nbefore him an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the seal\\nof his dead friend. “PRIVATE: for the hands of G. J. Utterson ALONE,\\nand in case of his predecease _to be destroyed unread_,” so it was\\nemphatically superscribed; and the lawyer dreaded to behold the\\ncontents. “I have buried one friend to-day,” he thought: “what if this\\nshould cost me another?” And then he condemned the fear as a\\ndisloyalty, and broke the seal. Within there was another enclosure,\\nlikewise sealed, and marked upon the cover as “not to be opened till\\nthe death or disappearance of Dr. Henry Jekyll.” Utterson could not\\ntrust his eyes. Yes, it was disappearance; here again, as in the mad\\nwill which he had long ago restored to its author, here again were the\\nidea of a disappearance and the name of Henry Jekyll bracketted. But in\\nthe will, that idea had sprung from the sinister suggestion of the man\\nHyde; it was set there with a purpose all too plain and horrible.\\nWritten by the hand of Lanyon, what should it mean? A great curiosity\\ncame on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition and dive at once to\\nthe bottom of these mysteries; but professional honour and faith to his\\ndead friend were stringent obligations; and the packet slept in the\\ninmost corner of his private safe.\\n\\nIt is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and it may\\nbe doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the society of his\\nsurviving friend with the same eagerness. He thought of him kindly; but\\nhis thoughts were disquieted and fearful. He went to call indeed; but\\nhe was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance; perhaps, in his heart,\\nhe preferred to speak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by\\nthe air and sounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted into\\nthat house of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with its\\ninscrutable recluse. Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to\\ncommunicate. The doctor, it appeared, now more than ever confined\\nhimself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would sometimes\\neven sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very silent, he did not\\nread; it seemed as if he had something on his mind. Utterson became so\\nused to the unvarying character of these reports, that he fell off\\nlittle by little in the frequency of his visits.\\n\\n\\n\\nINCIDENT AT THE WINDOW\\n\\nIt chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk with Mr.\\nEnfield, that their way lay once again through the by-street; and that\\nwhen they came in front of the door, both stopped to gaze on it.\\n\\n“Well,” said Enfield, “that story’s at an end at least. We shall never\\nsee more of Mr. Hyde.”\\n\\n“I hope not,” said Utterson. “Did I ever tell you that I once saw him,\\nand shared your feeling of repulsion?”\\n\\n“It was impossible to do the one without the other,” returned Enfield.\\n“And by the way, what an ass you must have thought me, not to know that\\nthis was a back way to Dr. Jekyll’s! It was partly your own fault that\\nI found it out, even when I did.”\\n\\n“So you found it out, did you?” said Utterson. “But if that be so, we\\nmay step into the court and take a look at the windows. To tell you the\\ntruth, I am uneasy about poor Jekyll; and even outside, I feel as if\\nthe presence of a friend might do him good.”\\n\\nThe court was very cool and a little damp, and full of premature\\ntwilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright with\\nsunset. The middle one of the three windows was half-way open; and\\nsitting close beside it, taking the air with an infinite sadness of\\nmien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr. Jekyll.\\n\\n“What! Jekyll!” he cried. “I trust you are better.”\\n\\n“I am very low, Utterson,” replied the doctor drearily, “very low. It\\nwill not last long, thank God.”\\n\\n“You stay too much indoors,” said the lawyer. “You should be out,\\nwhipping up the circulation like Mr. Enfield and me. (This is my\\ncousin—Mr. Enfield—Dr. Jekyll.) Come now; get your hat and take a quick\\nturn with us.”\\n\\n“You are very good,” sighed the other. “I should like to very much; but\\nno, no, no, it is quite impossible; I dare not. But indeed, Utterson, I\\nam very glad to see you; this is really a great pleasure; I would ask\\nyou and Mr. Enfield up, but the place is really not fit.”\\n\\n“Why, then,” said the lawyer, good-naturedly, “the best thing we can do\\nis to stay down here and speak with you from where we are.”\\n\\n“That is just what I was about to venture to propose,” returned the\\ndoctor with a smile. But the words were hardly uttered, before the\\nsmile was struck out of his face and succeeded by an expression of such\\nabject terror and despair, as froze the very blood of the two gentlemen\\nbelow. They saw it but for a glimpse for the window was instantly\\nthrust down; but that glimpse had been sufficient, and they turned and\\nleft the court without a word. In silence, too, they traversed the\\nby-street; and it was not until they had come into a neighbouring\\nthoroughfare, where even upon a Sunday there were still some stirrings\\nof life, that Mr. Utterson at last turned and looked at his companion.\\nThey were both pale; and there was an answering horror in their eyes.\\n\\n“God forgive us, God forgive us,” said Mr. Utterson.\\n\\nBut Mr. Enfield only nodded his head very seriously, and walked on once\\nmore in silence.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE LAST NIGHT\\n\\nMr. Utterson was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner, when\\nhe was surprised to receive a visit from Poole.\\n\\n“Bless me, Poole, what brings you here?” he cried; and then taking a\\nsecond look at him, “What ails you?” he added; “is the doctor ill?”\\n\\n“Mr. Utterson,” said the man, “there is something wrong.”\\n\\n“Take a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you,” said the lawyer.\\n“Now, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want.”\\n\\n“You know the doctor’s ways, sir,” replied Poole, “and how he shuts\\nhimself up. Well, he’s shut up again in the cabinet; and I don’t like\\nit, sir—I wish I may die if I like it. Mr. Utterson, sir, I’m afraid.”\\n\\n“Now, my good man,” said the lawyer, “be explicit. What are you afraid\\nof?”\\n\\n“I’ve been afraid for about a week,” returned Poole, doggedly\\ndisregarding the question, “and I can bear it no more.”\\n\\nThe man’s appearance amply bore out his words; his manner was altered\\nfor the worse; and except for the moment when he had first announced\\nhis terror, he had not once looked the lawyer in the face. Even now, he\\nsat with the glass of wine untasted on his knee, and his eyes directed\\nto a corner of the floor. “I can bear it no more,” he repeated.\\n\\n“Come,” said the lawyer, “I see you have some good reason, Poole; I see\\nthere is something seriously amiss. Try to tell me what it is.”\\n\\n“I think there’s been foul play,” said Poole, hoarsely.\\n\\n“Foul play!” cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and rather\\ninclined to be irritated in consequence. “What foul play! What does the\\nman mean?”\\n\\n“I daren’t say, sir,” was the answer; “but will you come along with me\\nand see for yourself?”\\n\\nMr. Utterson’s only answer was to rise and get his hat and greatcoat;\\nbut he observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appeared\\nupon the butler’s face, and perhaps with no less, that the wine was\\nstill untasted when he set it down to follow.\\n\\nIt was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March, with a pale moon, lying\\non her back as though the wind had tilted her, and flying wrack of the\\nmost diaphanous and lawny texture. The wind made talking difficult, and\\nflecked the blood into the face. It seemed to have swept the streets\\nunusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. Utterson thought he had\\nnever seen that part of London so deserted. He could have wished it\\notherwise; never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish\\nto see and touch his fellow-creatures; for struggle as he might, there\\nwas borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity. The\\nsquare, when they got there, was full of wind and dust, and the thin\\ntrees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing. Poole,\\nwho had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the\\nmiddle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took off\\nhis hat and mopped his brow with a red pocket-handkerchief. But for all\\nthe hurry of his coming, these were not the dews of exertion that he\\nwiped away, but the moisture of some strangling anguish; for his face\\nwas white and his voice, when he spoke, harsh and broken.\\n\\n“Well, sir,” he said, “here we are, and God grant there be nothing\\nwrong.”\\n\\n“Amen, Poole,” said the lawyer.\\n\\nThereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner; the door was\\nopened on the chain; and a voice asked from within, “Is that you,\\nPoole?”\\n\\n“It’s all right,” said Poole. “Open the door.”\\n\\nThe hall, when they entered it, was brightly lighted up; the fire was\\nbuilt high; and about the hearth the whole of the servants, men and\\nwomen, stood huddled together like a flock of sheep. At the sight of\\nMr. Utterson, the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering; and the\\ncook, crying out “Bless God! it’s Mr. Utterson,” ran forward as if to\\ntake him in her arms.\\n\\n“What, what? Are you all here?” said the lawyer peevishly. “Very\\nirregular, very unseemly; your master would be far from pleased.”\\n\\n“They’re all afraid,” said Poole.\\n\\nBlank silence followed, no one protesting; only the maid lifted her\\nvoice and now wept loudly.\\n\\n“Hold your tongue!” Poole said to her, with a ferocity of accent that\\ntestified to his own jangled nerves; and indeed, when the girl had so\\nsuddenly raised the note of her lamentation, they had all started and\\nturned towards the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation. “And\\nnow,” continued the butler, addressing the knife-boy, “reach me a\\ncandle, and we’ll get this through hands at once.” And then he begged\\nMr. Utterson to follow him, and led the way to the back garden.\\n\\n“Now, sir,” said he, “you come as gently as you can. I want you to\\nhear, and I don’t want you to be heard. And see here, sir, if by any\\nchance he was to ask you in, don’t go.”\\n\\nMr. Utterson’s nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk\\nthat nearly threw him from his balance; but he recollected his courage\\nand followed the butler into the laboratory building through the\\nsurgical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to the foot of\\nthe stair. Here Poole motioned him to stand on one side and listen;\\nwhile he himself, setting down the candle and making a great and\\nobvious call on his resolution, mounted the steps and knocked with a\\nsomewhat uncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door.\\n\\n“Mr. Utterson, sir, asking to see you,” he called; and even as he did\\nso, once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear.\\n\\nA voice answered from within: “Tell him I cannot see anyone,” it said\\ncomplainingly.\\n\\n“Thank you, sir,” said Poole, with a note of something like triumph in\\nhis voice; and taking up his candle, he led Mr. Utterson back across\\nthe yard and into the great kitchen, where the fire was out and the\\nbeetles were leaping on the floor.\\n\\n“Sir,” he said, looking Mr. Utterson in the eyes, “Was that my master’s\\nvoice?”\\n\\n“It seems much changed,” replied the lawyer, very pale, but giving look\\nfor look.\\n\\n“Changed? Well, yes, I think so,” said the butler. “Have I been twenty\\nyears in this man’s house, to be deceived about his voice? No, sir;\\nmaster’s made away with; he was made away with eight days ago, when we\\nheard him cry out upon the name of God; and _who’s_ in there instead of\\nhim, and _why_ it stays there, is a thing that cries to Heaven, Mr.\\nUtterson!”\\n\\n“This is a very strange tale, Poole; this is rather a wild tale my\\nman,” said Mr. Utterson, biting his finger. “Suppose it were as you\\nsuppose, supposing Dr. Jekyll to have been—well, murdered, what could\\ninduce the murderer to stay? That won’t hold water; it doesn’t commend\\nitself to reason.”\\n\\n“Well, Mr. Utterson, you are a hard man to satisfy, but I’ll do it\\nyet,” said Poole. “All this last week (you must know) him, or it,\\nwhatever it is that lives in that cabinet, has been crying night and\\nday for some sort of medicine and cannot get it to his mind. It was\\nsometimes his way—the master’s, that is—to write his orders on a sheet\\nof paper and throw it on the stair. We’ve had nothing else this week\\nback; nothing but papers, and a closed door, and the very meals left\\nthere to be smuggled in when nobody was looking. Well, sir, every day,\\nay, and twice and thrice in the same day, there have been orders and\\ncomplaints, and I have been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists\\nin town. Every time I brought the stuff back, there would be another\\npaper telling me to return it, because it was not pure, and another\\norder to a different firm. This drug is wanted bitter bad, sir,\\nwhatever for.”\\n\\n“Have you any of these papers?” asked Mr. Utterson.\\n\\nPoole felt in his pocket and handed out a crumpled note, which the\\nlawyer, bending nearer to the candle, carefully examined. Its contents\\nran thus: “Dr. Jekyll presents his compliments to Messrs. Maw. He\\nassures them that their last sample is impure and quite useless for his\\npresent purpose. In the year 18—, Dr. J. purchased a somewhat large\\nquantity from Messrs. M. He now begs them to search with most sedulous\\ncare, and should any of the same quality be left, forward it to him at\\nonce. Expense is no consideration. The importance of this to Dr. J. can\\nhardly be exaggerated.” So far the letter had run composedly enough,\\nbut here with a sudden splutter of the pen, the writer’s emotion had\\nbroken loose. “For God’s sake,” he added, “find me some of the old.”\\n\\n“This is a strange note,” said Mr. Utterson; and then sharply, “How do\\nyou come to have it open?”\\n\\n“The man at Maw’s was main angry, sir, and he threw it back to me like\\nso much dirt,” returned Poole.\\n\\n“This is unquestionably the doctor’s hand, do you know?” resumed the\\nlawyer.\\n\\n“I thought it looked like it,” said the servant rather sulkily; and\\nthen, with another voice, “But what matters hand of write?” he said.\\n“I’ve seen him!”\\n\\n“Seen him?” repeated Mr. Utterson. “Well?”\\n\\n“That’s it!” said Poole. “It was this way. I came suddenly into the\\ntheatre from the garden. It seems he had slipped out to look for this\\ndrug or whatever it is; for the cabinet door was open, and there he was\\nat the far end of the room digging among the crates. He looked up when\\nI came in, gave a kind of cry, and whipped upstairs into the cabinet.\\nIt was but for one minute that I saw him, but the hair stood upon my\\nhead like quills. Sir, if that was my master, why had he a mask upon\\nhis face? If it was my master, why did he cry out like a rat, and run\\nfrom me? I have served him long enough. And then...” The man paused and\\npassed his hand over his face.\\n\\n“These are all very strange circumstances,” said Mr. Utterson, “but I\\nthink I begin to see daylight. Your master, Poole, is plainly seized\\nwith one of those maladies that both torture and deform the sufferer;\\nhence, for aught I know, the alteration of his voice; hence the mask\\nand the avoidance of his friends; hence his eagerness to find this\\ndrug, by means of which the poor soul retains some hope of ultimate\\nrecovery—God grant that he be not deceived! There is my explanation; it\\nis sad enough, Poole, ay, and appalling to consider; but it is plain\\nand natural, hangs well together, and delivers us from all exorbitant\\nalarms.”\\n\\n“Sir,” said the butler, turning to a sort of mottled pallor, “that\\nthing was not my master, and there’s the truth. My master”—here he\\nlooked round him and began to whisper—“is a tall, fine build of a man,\\nand this was more of a dwarf.” Utterson attempted to protest. “O, sir,”\\ncried Poole, “do you think I do not know my master after twenty years?\\nDo you think I do not know where his head comes to in the cabinet door,\\nwhere I saw him every morning of my life? No, sir, that thing in the\\nmask was never Dr. Jekyll—God knows what it was, but it was never Dr.\\nJekyll; and it is the belief of my heart that there was murder done.”\\n\\n“Poole,” replied the lawyer, “if you say that, it will become my duty\\nto make certain. Much as I desire to spare your master’s feelings, much\\nas I am puzzled by this note which seems to prove him to be still\\nalive, I shall consider it my duty to break in that door.”\\n\\n“Ah, Mr. Utterson, that’s talking!” cried the butler.\\n\\n“And now comes the second question,” resumed Utterson: “Who is going to\\ndo it?”\\n\\n“Why, you and me, sir,” was the undaunted reply.\\n\\n“That’s very well said,” returned the lawyer; “and whatever comes of\\nit, I shall make it my business to see you are no loser.”\\n\\n“There is an axe in the theatre,” continued Poole; “and you might take\\nthe kitchen poker for yourself.”\\n\\nThe lawyer took that rude but weighty instrument into his hand, and\\nbalanced it. “Do you know, Poole,” he said, looking up, “that you and I\\nare about to place ourselves in a position of some peril?”\\n\\n“You may say so, sir, indeed,” returned the butler.\\n\\n“It is well, then that we should be frank,” said the other. “We both\\nthink more than we have said; let us make a clean breast. This masked\\nfigure that you saw, did you recognise it?”\\n\\n“Well, sir, it went so quick, and the creature was so doubled up, that\\nI could hardly swear to that,” was the answer. “But if you mean, was it\\nMr. Hyde?—why, yes, I think it was! You see, it was much of the same\\nbigness; and it had the same quick, light way with it; and then who\\nelse could have got in by the laboratory door? You have not forgot,\\nsir, that at the time of the murder he had still the key with him? But\\nthat’s not all. I don’t know, Mr. Utterson, if you ever met this Mr.\\nHyde?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said the lawyer, “I once spoke with him.”\\n\\n“Then you must know as well as the rest of us that there was something\\nqueer about that gentleman—something that gave a man a turn—I don’t\\nknow rightly how to say it, sir, beyond this: that you felt in your\\nmarrow kind of cold and thin.”\\n\\n“I own I felt something of what you describe,” said Mr. Utterson.\\n\\n“Quite so, sir,” returned Poole. “Well, when that masked thing like a\\nmonkey jumped from among the chemicals and whipped into the cabinet, it\\nwent down my spine like ice. O, I know it’s not evidence, Mr. Utterson;\\nI’m book-learned enough for that; but a man has his feelings, and I\\ngive you my bible-word it was Mr. Hyde!”\\n\\n“Ay, ay,” said the lawyer. “My fears incline to the same point. Evil, I\\nfear, founded—evil was sure to come—of that connection. Ay truly, I\\nbelieve you; I believe poor Harry is killed; and I believe his murderer\\n(for what purpose, God alone can tell) is still lurking in his victim’s\\nroom. Well, let our name be vengeance. Call Bradshaw.”\\n\\nThe footman came at the summons, very white and nervous.\\n\\n“Pull yourself together, Bradshaw,” said the lawyer. “This suspense, I\\nknow, is telling upon all of you; but it is now our intention to make\\nan end of it. Poole, here, and I are going to force our way into the\\ncabinet. If all is well, my shoulders are broad enough to bear the\\nblame. Meanwhile, lest anything should really be amiss, or any\\nmalefactor seek to escape by the back, you and the boy must go round\\nthe corner with a pair of good sticks and take your post at the\\nlaboratory door. We give you ten minutes to get to your stations.”\\n\\nAs Bradshaw left, the lawyer looked at his watch. “And now, Poole, let\\nus get to ours,” he said; and taking the poker under his arm, led the\\nway into the yard. The scud had banked over the moon, and it was now\\nquite dark. The wind, which only broke in puffs and draughts into that\\ndeep well of building, tossed the light of the candle to and fro about\\ntheir steps, until they came into the shelter of the theatre, where\\nthey sat down silently to wait. London hummed solemnly all around; but\\nnearer at hand, the stillness was only broken by the sounds of a\\nfootfall moving to and fro along the cabinet floor.\\n\\n“So it will walk all day, sir,” whispered Poole; “ay, and the better\\npart of the night. Only when a new sample comes from the chemist,\\nthere’s a bit of a break. Ah, it’s an ill conscience that’s such an\\nenemy to rest! Ah, sir, there’s blood foully shed in every step of it!\\nBut hark again, a little closer—put your heart in your ears, Mr.\\nUtterson, and tell me, is that the doctor’s foot?”\\n\\nThe steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all they\\nwent so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread\\nof Henry Jekyll. Utterson sighed. “Is there never anything else?” he\\nasked.\\n\\nPoole nodded. “Once,” he said. “Once I heard it weeping!”\\n\\n“Weeping? how that?” said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill of\\nhorror.\\n\\n“Weeping like a woman or a lost soul,” said the butler. “I came away\\nwith that upon my heart, that I could have wept too.”\\n\\nBut now the ten minutes drew to an end. Poole disinterred the axe from\\nunder a stack of packing straw; the candle was set upon the nearest\\ntable to light them to the attack; and they drew near with bated breath\\nto where that patient foot was still going up and down, up and down, in\\nthe quiet of the night.\\n\\n“Jekyll,” cried Utterson, with a loud voice, “I demand to see you.” He\\npaused a moment, but there came no reply. “I give you fair warning, our\\nsuspicions are aroused, and I must and shall see you,” he resumed; “if\\nnot by fair means, then by foul—if not of your consent, then by brute\\nforce!”\\n\\n“Utterson,” said the voice, “for God’s sake, have mercy!”\\n\\n“Ah, that’s not Jekyll’s voice—it’s Hyde’s!” cried Utterson. “Down with\\nthe door, Poole!”\\n\\nPoole swung the axe over his shoulder; the blow shook the building, and\\nthe red baize door leaped against the lock and hinges. A dismal\\nscreech, as of mere animal terror, rang from the cabinet. Up went the\\naxe again, and again the panels crashed and the frame bounded; four\\ntimes the blow fell; but the wood was tough and the fittings were of\\nexcellent workmanship; and it was not until the fifth, that the lock\\nburst and the wreck of the door fell inwards on the carpet.\\n\\nThe besiegers, appalled by their own riot and the stillness that had\\nsucceeded, stood back a little and peered in. There lay the cabinet\\nbefore their eyes in the quiet lamplight, a good fire glowing and\\nchattering on the hearth, the kettle singing its thin strain, a drawer\\nor two open, papers neatly set forth on the business table, and nearer\\nthe fire, the things laid out for tea; the quietest room, you would\\nhave said, and, but for the glazed presses full of chemicals, the most\\ncommonplace that night in London.\\n\\nRight in the middle there lay the body of a man sorely contorted and\\nstill twitching. They drew near on tiptoe, turned it on its back and\\nbeheld the face of Edward Hyde. He was dressed in clothes far too large\\nfor him, clothes of the doctor’s bigness; the cords of his face still\\nmoved with a semblance of life, but life was quite gone; and by the\\ncrushed phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernels that hung\\nupon the air, Utterson knew that he was looking on the body of a\\nself-destroyer.\\n\\n“We have come too late,” he said sternly, “whether to save or punish.\\nHyde is gone to his account; and it only remains for us to find the\\nbody of your master.”\\n\\nThe far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theatre,\\nwhich filled almost the whole ground storey and was lighted from above,\\nand by the cabinet, which formed an upper storey at one end and looked\\nupon the court. A corridor joined the theatre to the door on the\\nby-street; and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a\\nsecond flight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and a\\nspacious cellar. All these they now thoroughly examined. Each closet\\nneeded but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell\\nfrom their doors, had stood long unopened. The cellar, indeed, was\\nfilled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon\\nwho was Jekyll’s predecessor; but even as they opened the door they\\nwere advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a\\nperfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance.\\nNowhere was there any trace of Henry Jekyll, dead or alive.\\n\\nPoole stamped on the flags of the corridor. “He must be buried here,”\\nhe said, hearkening to the sound.\\n\\n“Or he may have fled,” said Utterson, and he turned to examine the door\\nin the by-street. It was locked; and lying near by on the flags, they\\nfound the key, already stained with rust.\\n\\n“This does not look like use,” observed the lawyer.\\n\\n“Use!” echoed Poole. “Do you not see, sir, it is broken? much as if a\\nman had stamped on it.”\\n\\n“Ay,” continued Utterson, “and the fractures, too, are rusty.” The two\\nmen looked at each other with a scare. “This is beyond me, Poole,” said\\nthe lawyer. “Let us go back to the cabinet.”\\n\\nThey mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasional\\nawestruck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to examine\\nthe contents of the cabinet. At one table, there were traces of\\nchemical work, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on\\nglass saucers, as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had\\nbeen prevented.\\n\\n“That is the same drug that I was always bringing him,” said Poole; and\\neven as he spoke, the kettle with a startling noise boiled over.\\n\\nThis brought them to the fireside, where the easy-chair was drawn\\ncosily up, and the tea things stood ready to the sitter’s elbow, the\\nvery sugar in the cup. There were several books on a shelf; one lay\\nbeside the tea things open, and Utterson was amazed to find it a copy\\nof a pious work, for which Jekyll had several times expressed a great\\nesteem, annotated, in his own hand with startling blasphemies.\\n\\nNext, in the course of their review of the chamber, the searchers came\\nto the cheval-glass, into whose depths they looked with an involuntary\\nhorror. But it was so turned as to show them nothing but the rosy glow\\nplaying on the roof, the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions along\\nthe glazed front of the presses, and their own pale and fearful\\ncountenances stooping to look in.\\n\\n“This glass has seen some strange things, sir,” whispered Poole.\\n\\n“And surely none stranger than itself,” echoed the lawyer in the same\\ntones. “For what did Jekyll”—he caught himself up at the word with a\\nstart, and then conquering the weakness—“what could Jekyll want with\\nit?” he said.\\n\\n“You may say that!” said Poole.\\n\\nNext they turned to the business table. On the desk, among the neat\\narray of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the\\ndoctor’s hand, the name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, and\\nseveral enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn in\\nthe same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months\\nbefore, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift\\nin case of disappearance; but in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the\\nlawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of Gabriel John\\nUtterson. He looked at Poole, and then back at the paper, and last of\\nall at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet.\\n\\n“My head goes round,” he said. “He has been all these days in\\npossession; he had no cause to like me; he must have raged to see\\nhimself displaced; and he has not destroyed this document.”\\n\\nHe caught up the next paper; it was a brief note in the doctor’s hand\\nand dated at the top. “O Poole!” the lawyer cried, “he was alive and\\nhere this day. He cannot have been disposed of in so short a space; he\\nmust be still alive, he must have fled! And then, why fled? and how?\\nand in that case, can we venture to declare this suicide? O, we must be\\ncareful. I foresee that we may yet involve your master in some dire\\ncatastrophe.”\\n\\n“Why don’t you read it, sir?” asked Poole.\\n\\n“Because I fear,” replied the lawyer solemnly. “God grant I have no\\ncause for it!” And with that he brought the paper to his eyes and read\\nas follows:\\n\\n\\n“My dear Utterson,—When this shall fall into your hands, I shall have\\ndisappeared, under what circumstances I have not the penetration to\\nforesee, but my instinct and all the circumstances of my nameless\\nsituation tell me that the end is sure and must be early. Go then, and\\nfirst read the narrative which Lanyon warned me he was to place in your\\nhands; and if you care to hear more, turn to the confession of\\n\\n“Your unworthy and unhappy friend,\\n\\n“HENRY JEKYLL.”\\n\\n\\n“There was a third enclosure?” asked Utterson.\\n\\n“Here, sir,” said Poole, and gave into his hands a considerable packet\\nsealed in several places.\\n\\nThe lawyer put it in his pocket. “I would say nothing of this paper. If\\nyour master has fled or is dead, we may at least save his credit. It is\\nnow ten; I must go home and read these documents in quiet; but I shall\\nbe back before midnight, when we shall send for the police.”\\n\\nThey went out, locking the door of the theatre behind them; and\\nUtterson, once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire in the\\nhall, trudged back to his office to read the two narratives in which\\nthis mystery was now to be explained.\\n\\n\\n\\nDR. LANYON’S NARRATIVE\\n\\nOn the ninth of January, now four days ago, I received by the evening\\ndelivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of my colleague\\nand old school companion, Henry Jekyll. I was a good deal surprised by\\nthis; for we were by no means in the habit of correspondence; I had\\nseen the man, dined with him, indeed, the night before; and I could\\nimagine nothing in our intercourse that should justify formality of\\nregistration. The contents increased my wonder; for this is how the\\nletter ran:\\n\\n“10_th December_, 18—.\\n\\n\\n“Dear Lanyon,—You are one of my oldest friends; and although we may\\nhave differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot remember, at\\nleast on my side, any break in our affection. There was never a day\\nwhen, if you had said to me, ‘Jekyll, my life, my honour, my reason,\\ndepend upon you,’ I would not have sacrificed my left hand to help you.\\nLanyon, my life, my honour, my reason, are all at your mercy; if you\\nfail me to-night, I am lost. You might suppose, after this preface,\\nthat I am going to ask you for something dishonourable to grant. Judge\\nfor yourself.\\n\\n“I want you to postpone all other engagements for to-night—ay, even if\\nyou were summoned to the bedside of an emperor; to take a cab, unless\\nyour carriage should be actually at the door; and with this letter in\\nyour hand for consultation, to drive straight to my house. Poole, my\\nbutler, has his orders; you will find him waiting your arrival with a\\nlocksmith. The door of my cabinet is then to be forced; and you are to\\ngo in alone; to open the glazed press (letter E) on the left hand,\\nbreaking the lock if it be shut; and to draw out, _with all its\\ncontents as they stand_, the fourth drawer from the top or (which is\\nthe same thing) the third from the bottom. In my extreme distress of\\nmind, I have a morbid fear of misdirecting you; but even if I am in\\nerror, you may know the right drawer by its contents: some powders, a\\nphial and a paper book. This drawer I beg of you to carry back with you\\nto Cavendish Square exactly as it stands.\\n\\n“That is the first part of the service: now for the second. You should\\nbe back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this, long before\\nmidnight; but I will leave you that amount of margin, not only in the\\nfear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor\\nforeseen, but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be\\npreferred for what will then remain to do. At midnight, then, I have to\\nask you to be alone in your consulting room, to admit with your own\\nhand into the house a man who will present himself in my name, and to\\nplace in his hands the drawer that you will have brought with you from\\nmy cabinet. Then you will have played your part and earned my gratitude\\ncompletely. Five minutes afterwards, if you insist upon an explanation,\\nyou will have understood that these arrangements are of capital\\nimportance; and that by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as they\\nmust appear, you might have charged your conscience with my death or\\nthe shipwreck of my reason.\\n\\n“Confident as I am that you will not trifle with this appeal, my heart\\nsinks and my hand trembles at the bare thought of such a possibility.\\nThink of me at this hour, in a strange place, labouring under a\\nblackness of distress that no fancy can exaggerate, and yet well aware\\nthat, if you will but punctually serve me, my troubles will roll away\\nlike a story that is told. Serve me, my dear Lanyon and save\\n\\n“Your friend,\\n\\n\\n“H.J.\\n\\n\\n“P.S.—I had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck upon my\\nsoul. It is possible that the post-office may fail me, and this letter\\nnot come into your hands until to-morrow morning. In that case, dear\\nLanyon, do my errand when it shall be most convenient for you in the\\ncourse of the day; and once more expect my messenger at midnight. It\\nmay then already be too late; and if that night passes without event,\\nyou will know that you have seen the last of Henry Jekyll.”\\n\\n\\nUpon the reading of this letter, I made sure my colleague was insane;\\nbut till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt, I felt bound\\nto do as he requested. The less I understood of this farrago, the less\\nI was in a position to judge of its importance; and an appeal so worded\\ncould not be set aside without a grave responsibility. I rose\\naccordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to\\nJekyll’s house. The butler was awaiting my arrival; he had received by\\nthe same post as mine a registered letter of instruction, and had sent\\nat once for a locksmith and a carpenter. The tradesmen came while we\\nwere yet speaking; and we moved in a body to old Dr. Denman’s surgical\\ntheatre, from which (as you are doubtless aware) Jekyll’s private\\ncabinet is most conveniently entered. The door was very strong, the\\nlock excellent; the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and\\nhave to do much damage, if force were to be used; and the locksmith was\\nnear despair. But this last was a handy fellow, and after two hour’s\\nwork, the door stood open. The press marked E was unlocked; and I took\\nout the drawer, had it filled up with straw and tied in a sheet, and\\nreturned with it to Cavendish Square.\\n\\nHere I proceeded to examine its contents. The powders were neatly\\nenough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist; so\\nthat it was plain they were of Jekyll’s private manufacture; and when I\\nopened one of the wrappers I found what seemed to me a simple\\ncrystalline salt of a white colour. The phial, to which I next turned\\nmy attention, might have been about half full of a blood-red liquor,\\nwhich was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to me to\\ncontain phosphorus and some volatile ether. At the other ingredients I\\ncould make no guess. The book was an ordinary version book and\\ncontained little but a series of dates. These covered a period of many\\nyears, but I observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and\\nquite abruptly. Here and there a brief remark was appended to a date,\\nusually no more than a single word: “double” occurring perhaps six\\ntimes in a total of several hundred entries; and once very early in the\\nlist and followed by several marks of exclamation, “total failure!!!”\\nAll this, though it whetted my curiosity, told me little that was\\ndefinite. Here were a phial of some salt, and the record of a series of\\nexperiments that had led (like too many of Jekyll’s investigations) to\\nno end of practical usefulness. How could the presence of these\\narticles in my house affect either the honour, the sanity, or the life\\nof my flighty colleague? If his messenger could go to one place, why\\ncould he not go to another? And even granting some impediment, why was\\nthis gentleman to be received by me in secret? The more I reflected the\\nmore convinced I grew that I was dealing with a case of cerebral\\ndisease; and though I dismissed my servants to bed, I loaded an old\\nrevolver, that I might be found in some posture of self-defence.\\n\\nTwelve o’clock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker sounded\\nvery gently on the door. I went myself at the summons, and found a\\nsmall man crouching against the pillars of the portico.\\n\\n“Are you come from Dr. Jekyll?” I asked.\\n\\nHe told me “yes” by a constrained gesture; and when I had bidden him\\nenter, he did not obey me without a searching backward glance into the\\ndarkness of the square. There was a policeman not far off, advancing\\nwith his bull’s eye open; and at the sight, I thought my visitor\\nstarted and made greater haste.\\n\\nThese particulars struck me, I confess, disagreeably; and as I followed\\nhim into the bright light of the consulting room, I kept my hand ready\\non my weapon. Here, at last, I had a chance of clearly seeing him. I\\nhad never set eyes on him before, so much was certain. He was small, as\\nI have said; I was struck besides with the shocking expression of his\\nface, with his remarkable combination of great muscular activity and\\ngreat apparent debility of constitution, and—last but not least—with\\nthe odd, subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhood. This bore\\nsome resemblance to incipient rigour, and was accompanied by a marked\\nsinking of the pulse. At the time, I set it down to some idiosyncratic,\\npersonal distaste, and merely wondered at the acuteness of the\\nsymptoms; but I have since had reason to believe the cause to lie much\\ndeeper in the nature of man, and to turn on some nobler hinge than the\\nprinciple of hatred.\\n\\nThis person (who had thus, from the first moment of his entrance,\\nstruck in me what I can only describe as a disgustful curiosity) was\\ndressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary person laughable;\\nhis clothes, that is to say, although they were of rich and sober\\nfabric, were enormously too large for him in every measurement—the\\ntrousers hanging on his legs and rolled up to keep them from the\\nground, the waist of the coat below his haunches, and the collar\\nsprawling wide upon his shoulders. Strange to relate, this ludicrous\\naccoutrement was far from moving me to laughter. Rather, as there was\\nsomething abnormal and misbegotten in the very essence of the creature\\nthat now faced me—something seizing, surprising and revolting—this\\nfresh disparity seemed but to fit in with and to reinforce it; so that\\nto my interest in the man’s nature and character, there was added a\\ncuriosity as to his origin, his life, his fortune and status in the\\nworld.\\n\\nThese observations, though they have taken so great a space to be set\\ndown in, were yet the work of a few seconds. My visitor was, indeed, on\\nfire with sombre excitement.\\n\\n“Have you got it?” he cried. “Have you got it?” And so lively was his\\nimpatience that he even laid his hand upon my arm and sought to shake\\nme.\\n\\nI put him back, conscious at his touch of a certain icy pang along my\\nblood. “Come, sir,” said I. “You forget that I have not yet the\\npleasure of your acquaintance. Be seated, if you please.” And I showed\\nhim an example, and sat down myself in my customary seat and with as\\nfair an imitation of my ordinary manner to a patient, as the lateness\\nof the hour, the nature of my preoccupations, and the horror I had of\\nmy visitor, would suffer me to muster.\\n\\n“I beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon,” he replied civilly enough. “What you\\nsay is very well founded; and my impatience has shown its heels to my\\npoliteness. I come here at the instance of your colleague, Dr. Henry\\nJekyll, on a piece of business of some moment; and I understood...” He\\npaused and put his hand to his throat, and I could see, in spite of his\\ncollected manner, that he was wrestling against the approaches of the\\nhysteria—“I understood, a drawer...”\\n\\nBut here I took pity on my visitor’s suspense, and some perhaps on my\\nown growing curiosity.\\n\\n“There it is, sir,” said I, pointing to the drawer, where it lay on the\\nfloor behind a table and still covered with the sheet.\\n\\nHe sprang to it, and then paused, and laid his hand upon his heart; I\\ncould hear his teeth grate with the convulsive action of his jaws; and\\nhis face was so ghastly to see that I grew alarmed both for his life\\nand reason.\\n\\n“Compose yourself,” said I.\\n\\nHe turned a dreadful smile to me, and as if with the decision of\\ndespair, plucked away the sheet. At sight of the contents, he uttered\\none loud sob of such immense relief that I sat petrified. And the next\\nmoment, in a voice that was already fairly well under control, “Have\\nyou a graduated glass?” he asked.\\n\\nI rose from my place with something of an effort and gave him what he\\nasked.\\n\\nHe thanked me with a smiling nod, measured out a few minims of the red\\ntincture and added one of the powders. The mixture, which was at first\\nof a reddish hue, began, in proportion as the crystals melted, to\\nbrighten in colour, to effervesce audibly, and to throw off small fumes\\nof vapour. Suddenly and at the same moment, the ebullition ceased and\\nthe compound changed to a dark purple, which faded again more slowly to\\na watery green. My visitor, who had watched these metamorphoses with a\\nkeen eye, smiled, set down the glass upon the table, and then turned\\nand looked upon me with an air of scrutiny.\\n\\n“And now,” said he, “to settle what remains. Will you be wise? will you\\nbe guided? will you suffer me to take this glass in my hand and to go\\nforth from your house without further parley? or has the greed of\\ncuriosity too much command of you? Think before you answer, for it\\nshall be done as you decide. As you decide, you shall be left as you\\nwere before, and neither richer nor wiser, unless the sense of service\\nrendered to a man in mortal distress may be counted as a kind of riches\\nof the soul. Or, if you shall so prefer to choose, a new province of\\nknowledge and new avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you,\\nhere, in this room, upon the instant; and your sight shall be blasted\\nby a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan.”\\n\\n“Sir,” said I, affecting a coolness that I was far from truly\\npossessing, “you speak enigmas, and you will perhaps not wonder that I\\nhear you with no very strong impression of belief. But I have gone too\\nfar in the way of inexplicable services to pause before I see the end.”\\n\\n“It is well,” replied my visitor. “Lanyon, you remember your vows: what\\nfollows is under the seal of our profession. And now, you who have so\\nlong been bound to the most narrow and material views, you who have\\ndenied the virtue of transcendental medicine, you who have derided your\\nsuperiors—behold!”\\n\\nHe put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp. A cry followed; he\\nreeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, staring with\\ninjected eyes, gasping with open mouth; and as I looked there came, I\\nthought, a change—he seemed to swell—his face became suddenly black and\\nthe features seemed to melt and alter—and the next moment, I had sprung\\nto my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arms raised to shield\\nme from that prodigy, my mind submerged in terror.\\n\\n“O God!” I screamed, and “O God!” again and again; for there before my\\neyes—pale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before him with\\nhis hands, like a man restored from death—there stood Henry Jekyll!\\n\\nWhat he told me in the next hour, I cannot bring my mind to set on\\npaper. I saw what I saw, I heard what I heard, and my soul sickened at\\nit; and yet now when that sight has faded from my eyes, I ask myself if\\nI believe it, and I cannot answer. My life is shaken to its roots;\\nsleep has left me; the deadliest terror sits by me at all hours of the\\nday and night; and I feel that my days are numbered, and that I must\\ndie; and yet I shall die incredulous. As for the moral turpitude that\\nman unveiled to me, even with tears of penitence, I cannot, even in\\nmemory, dwell on it without a start of horror. I will say but one\\nthing, Utterson, and that (if you can bring your mind to credit it)\\nwill be more than enough. The creature who crept into my house that\\nnight was, on Jekyll’s own confession, known by the name of Hyde and\\nhunted for in every corner of the land as the murderer of Carew.\\n\\nHASTIE LANYON.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHENRY JEKYLL’S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE\\n\\nI was born in the year 18— to a large fortune, endowed besides with\\nexcellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect of\\nthe wise and good among my fellowmen, and thus, as might have been\\nsupposed, with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished\\nfuture. And indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatient\\ngaiety of disposition, such as has made the happiness of many, but such\\nas I found it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my\\nhead high, and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the\\npublic. Hence it came about that I concealed my pleasures; and that\\nwhen I reached years of reflection, and began to look round me and take\\nstock of my progress and position in the world, I stood already\\ncommitted to a profound duplicity of life. Many a man would have even\\nblazoned such irregularities as I was guilty of; but from the high\\nviews that I had set before me, I regarded and hid them with an almost\\nmorbid sense of shame. It was thus rather the exacting nature of my\\naspirations than any particular degradation in my faults, that made me\\nwhat I was, and, with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men,\\nsevered in me those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound\\nman’s dual nature. In this case, I was driven to reflect deeply and\\ninveterately on that hard law of life, which lies at the root of\\nreligion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress. Though\\nso profound a double-dealer, I was in no sense a hypocrite; both sides\\nof me were in dead earnest; I was no more myself when I laid aside\\nrestraint and plunged in shame, than when I laboured, in the eye of\\nday, at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and\\nsuffering. And it chanced that the direction of my scientific studies,\\nwhich led wholly towards the mystic and the transcendental, reacted and\\nshed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among my\\nmembers. With every day, and from both sides of my intelligence, the\\nmoral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth,\\nby whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful\\nshipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two. I say two, because\\nthe state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point. Others\\nwill follow, others will outstrip me on the same lines; and I hazard\\nthe guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of\\nmultifarious, incongruous and independent denizens. I, for my part,\\nfrom the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one direction and in\\none direction only. It was on the moral side, and in my own person,\\nthat I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man;\\nI saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my\\nconsciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was\\nonly because I was radically both; and from an early date, even before\\nthe course of my scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most\\nnaked possibility of such a miracle, I had learned to dwell with\\npleasure, as a beloved daydream, on the thought of the separation of\\nthese elements. If each, I told myself, could be housed in separate\\nidentities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable; the\\nunjust might go his way, delivered from the aspirations and remorse of\\nhis more upright twin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely\\non his upward path, doing the good things in which he found his\\npleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands\\nof this extraneous evil. It was the curse of mankind that these\\nincongruous faggots were thus bound together—that in the agonised womb\\nof consciousness, these polar twins should be continuously struggling.\\nHow, then were they dissociated?\\n\\nI was so far in my reflections when, as I have said, a side light began\\nto shine upon the subject from the laboratory table. I began to\\nperceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated, the trembling\\nimmateriality, the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid body\\nin which we walk attired. Certain agents I found to have the power to\\nshake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss\\nthe curtains of a pavilion. For two good reasons, I will not enter\\ndeeply into this scientific branch of my confession. First, because I\\nhave been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound\\nfor ever on man’s shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast it\\noff, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful\\npressure. Second, because, as my narrative will make, alas! too\\nevident, my discoveries were incomplete. Enough then, that I not only\\nrecognised my natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain\\nof the powers that made up my spirit, but managed to compound a drug by\\nwhich these powers should be dethroned from their supremacy, and a\\nsecond form and countenance substituted, none the less natural to me\\nbecause they were the expression, and bore the stamp, of lower elements\\nin my soul.\\n\\nI hesitated long before I put this theory to the test of practice. I\\nknew well that I risked death; for any drug that so potently controlled\\nand shook the very fortress of identity, might, by the least scruple of\\nan overdose or at the least inopportunity in the moment of exhibition,\\nutterly blot out that immaterial tabernacle which I looked to it to\\nchange. But the temptation of a discovery so singular and profound at\\nlast overcame the suggestions of alarm. I had long since prepared my\\ntincture; I purchased at once, from a firm of wholesale chemists, a\\nlarge quantity of a particular salt which I knew, from my experiments,\\nto be the last ingredient required; and late one accursed night, I\\ncompounded the elements, watched them boil and smoke together in the\\nglass, and when the ebullition had subsided, with a strong glow of\\ncourage, drank off the potion.\\n\\nThe most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones, deadly\\nnausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour\\nof birth or death. Then these agonies began swiftly to subside, and I\\ncame to myself as if out of a great sickness. There was something\\nstrange in my sensations, something indescribably new and, from its\\nvery novelty, incredibly sweet. I felt younger, lighter, happier in\\nbody; within I was conscious of a heady recklessness, a current of\\ndisordered sensual images running like a millrace in my fancy, a\\nsolution of the bonds of obligation, an unknown but not an innocent\\nfreedom of the soul. I knew myself, at the first breath of this new\\nlife, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to my\\noriginal evil; and the thought, in that moment, braced and delighted me\\nlike wine. I stretched out my hands, exulting in the freshness of these\\nsensations; and in the act, I was suddenly aware that I had lost in\\nstature.\\n\\nThere was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands beside\\nme as I write, was brought there later on and for the very purpose of\\nthese transformations. The night however, was far gone into the\\nmorning—the morning, black as it was, was nearly ripe for the\\nconception of the day—the inmates of my house were locked in the most\\nrigorous hours of slumber; and I determined, flushed as I was with hope\\nand triumph, to venture in my new shape as far as to my bedroom. I\\ncrossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down upon me, I\\ncould have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort that\\ntheir unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them; I stole through\\nthe corridors, a stranger in my own house; and coming to my room, I saw\\nfor the first time the appearance of Edward Hyde.\\n\\nI must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know, but\\nthat which I suppose to be most probable. The evil side of my nature,\\nto which I had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was less robust\\nand less developed than the good which I had just deposed. Again, in\\nthe course of my life, which had been, after all, nine tenths a life of\\neffort, virtue and control, it had been much less exercised and much\\nless exhausted. And hence, as I think, it came about that Edward Hyde\\nwas so much smaller, slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll. Even as\\ngood shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly\\nand plainly on the face of the other. Evil besides (which I must still\\nbelieve to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an imprint\\nof deformity and decay. And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in\\nthe glass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of\\nwelcome. This, too, was myself. It seemed natural and human. In my eyes\\nit bore a livelier image of the spirit, it seemed more express and\\nsingle, than the imperfect and divided countenance I had been hitherto\\naccustomed to call mine. And in so far I was doubtless right. I have\\nobserved that when I wore the semblance of Edward Hyde, none could come\\nnear to me at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh. This, as\\nI take it, was because all human beings, as we meet them, are\\ncommingled out of good and evil: and Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of\\nmankind, was pure evil.\\n\\nI lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive\\nexperiment had yet to be attempted; it yet remained to be seen if I had\\nlost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight from a\\nhouse that was no longer mine; and hurrying back to my cabinet, I once\\nmore prepared and drank the cup, once more suffered the pangs of\\ndissolution, and came to myself once more with the character, the\\nstature and the face of Henry Jekyll.\\n\\nThat night I had come to the fatal cross-roads. Had I approached my\\ndiscovery in a more noble spirit, had I risked the experiment while\\nunder the empire of generous or pious aspirations, all must have been\\notherwise, and from these agonies of death and birth, I had come forth\\nan angel instead of a fiend. The drug had no discriminating action; it\\nwas neither diabolical nor divine; it but shook the doors of the\\nprisonhouse of my disposition; and like the captives of Philippi, that\\nwhich stood within ran forth. At that time my virtue slumbered; my\\nevil, kept awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize the\\noccasion; and the thing that was projected was Edward Hyde. Hence,\\nalthough I had now two characters as well as two appearances, one was\\nwholly evil, and the other was still the old Henry Jekyll, that\\nincongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement I had already\\nlearned to despair. The movement was thus wholly toward the worse.\\n\\nEven at that time, I had not conquered my aversions to the dryness of a\\nlife of study. I would still be merrily disposed at times; and as my\\npleasures were (to say the least) undignified, and I was not only well\\nknown and highly considered, but growing towards the elderly man, this\\nincoherency of my life was daily growing more unwelcome. It was on this\\nside that my new power tempted me until I fell in slavery. I had but to\\ndrink the cup, to doff at once the body of the noted professor, and to\\nassume, like a thick cloak, that of Edward Hyde. I smiled at the\\nnotion; it seemed to me at the time to be humourous; and I made my\\npreparations with the most studious care. I took and furnished that\\nhouse in Soho, to which Hyde was tracked by the police; and engaged as\\na housekeeper a creature whom I knew well to be silent and\\nunscrupulous. On the other side, I announced to my servants that a Mr.\\nHyde (whom I described) was to have full liberty and power about my\\nhouse in the square; and to parry mishaps, I even called and made\\nmyself a familiar object, in my second character. I next drew up that\\nwill to which you so much objected; so that if anything befell me in\\nthe person of Dr. Jekyll, I could enter on that of Edward Hyde without\\npecuniary loss. And thus fortified, as I supposed, on every side, I\\nbegan to profit by the strange immunities of my position.\\n\\nMen have before hired bravos to transact their crimes, while their own\\nperson and reputation sat under shelter. I was the first that ever did\\nso for his pleasures. I was the first that could plod in the public eye\\nwith a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like a\\nschoolboy, strip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of\\nliberty. But for me, in my impenetrable mantle, the safety was\\ncomplete. Think of it—I did not even exist! Let me but escape into my\\nlaboratory door, give me but a second or two to mix and swallow the\\ndraught that I had always standing ready; and whatever he had done,\\nEdward Hyde would pass away like the stain of breath upon a mirror; and\\nthere in his stead, quietly at home, trimming the midnight lamp in his\\nstudy, a man who could afford to laugh at suspicion, would be Henry\\nJekyll.\\n\\nThe pleasures which I made haste to seek in my disguise were, as I have\\nsaid, undignified; I would scarce use a harder term. But in the hands\\nof Edward Hyde, they soon began to turn toward the monstrous. When I\\nwould come back from these excursions, I was often plunged into a kind\\nof wonder at my vicarious depravity. This familiar that I called out of\\nmy own soul, and sent forth alone to do his good pleasure, was a being\\ninherently malign and villainous; his every act and thought centered on\\nself; drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture\\nto another; relentless like a man of stone. Henry Jekyll stood at times\\naghast before the acts of Edward Hyde; but the situation was apart from\\nordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience. It was\\nHyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty. Jekyll was no worse;\\nhe woke again to his good qualities seemingly unimpaired; he would even\\nmake haste, where it was possible, to undo the evil done by Hyde. And\\nthus his conscience slumbered.\\n\\nInto the details of the infamy at which I thus connived (for even now I\\ncan scarce grant that I committed it) I have no design of entering; I\\nmean but to point out the warnings and the successive steps with which\\nmy chastisement approached. I met with one accident which, as it\\nbrought on no consequence, I shall no more than mention. An act of\\ncruelty to a child aroused against me the anger of a passer-by, whom I\\nrecognised the other day in the person of your kinsman; the doctor and\\nthe child’s family joined him; there were moments when I feared for my\\nlife; and at last, in order to pacify their too just resentment, Edward\\nHyde had to bring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque drawn in\\nthe name of Henry Jekyll. But this danger was easily eliminated from\\nthe future, by opening an account at another bank in the name of Edward\\nHyde himself; and when, by sloping my own hand backward, I had supplied\\nmy double with a signature, I thought I sat beyond the reach of fate.\\n\\nSome two months before the murder of Sir Danvers, I had been out for\\none of my adventures, had returned at a late hour, and woke the next\\nday in bed with somewhat odd sensations. It was in vain I looked about\\nme; in vain I saw the decent furniture and tall proportions of my room\\nin the square; in vain that I recognised the pattern of the bed\\ncurtains and the design of the mahogany frame; something still kept\\ninsisting that I was not where I was, that I had not wakened where I\\nseemed to be, but in the little room in Soho where I was accustomed to\\nsleep in the body of Edward Hyde. I smiled to myself, and in my\\npsychological way, began lazily to inquire into the elements of this\\nillusion, occasionally, even as I did so, dropping back into a\\ncomfortable morning doze. I was still so engaged when, in one of my\\nmore wakeful moments, my eyes fell upon my hand. Now the hand of Henry\\nJekyll (as you have often remarked) was professional in shape and size;\\nit was large, firm, white and comely. But the hand which I now saw,\\nclearly enough, in the yellow light of a mid-London morning, lying half\\nshut on the bedclothes, was lean, corded, knuckly, of a dusky pallor\\nand thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair. It was the hand of\\nEdward Hyde.\\n\\nI must have stared upon it for near half a minute, sunk as I was in the\\nmere stupidity of wonder, before terror woke up in my breast as sudden\\nand startling as the crash of cymbals; and bounding from my bed I\\nrushed to the mirror. At the sight that met my eyes, my blood was\\nchanged into something exquisitely thin and icy. Yes, I had gone to bed\\nHenry Jekyll, I had awakened Edward Hyde. How was this to be explained?\\nI asked myself; and then, with another bound of terror—how was it to be\\nremedied? It was well on in the morning; the servants were up; all my\\ndrugs were in the cabinet—a long journey down two pairs of stairs,\\nthrough the back passage, across the open court and through the\\nanatomical theatre, from where I was then standing horror-struck. It\\nmight indeed be possible to cover my face; but of what use was that,\\nwhen I was unable to conceal the alteration in my stature? And then\\nwith an overpowering sweetness of relief, it came back upon my mind\\nthat the servants were already used to the coming and going of my\\nsecond self. I had soon dressed, as well as I was able, in clothes of\\nmy own size: had soon passed through the house, where Bradshaw stared\\nand drew back at seeing Mr. Hyde at such an hour and in such a strange\\narray; and ten minutes later, Dr. Jekyll had returned to his own shape\\nand was sitting down, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of\\nbreakfasting.\\n\\nSmall indeed was my appetite. This inexplicable incident, this reversal\\nof my previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian finger on the\\nwall, to be spelling out the letters of my judgment; and I began to\\nreflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibilities\\nof my double existence. That part of me which I had the power of\\nprojecting, had lately been much exercised and nourished; it had seemed\\nto me of late as though the body of Edward Hyde had grown in stature,\\nas though (when I wore that form) I were conscious of a more generous\\ntide of blood; and I began to spy a danger that, if this were much\\nprolonged, the balance of my nature might be permanently overthrown,\\nthe power of voluntary change be forfeited, and the character of Edward\\nHyde become irrevocably mine. The power of the drug had not been always\\nequally displayed. Once, very early in my career, it had totally failed\\nme; since then I had been obliged on more than one occasion to double,\\nand once, with infinite risk of death, to treble the amount; and these\\nrare uncertainties had cast hitherto the sole shadow on my contentment.\\nNow, however, and in the light of that morning’s accident, I was led to\\nremark that whereas, in the beginning, the difficulty had been to throw\\noff the body of Jekyll, it had of late gradually but decidedly\\ntransferred itself to the other side. All things therefore seemed to\\npoint to this; that I was slowly losing hold of my original and better\\nself, and becoming slowly incorporated with my second and worse.\\n\\nBetween these two, I now felt I had to choose. My two natures had\\nmemory in common, but all other faculties were most unequally shared\\nbetween them. Jekyll (who was composite) now with the most sensitive\\napprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and shared in the\\npleasures and adventures of Hyde; but Hyde was indifferent to Jekyll,\\nor but remembered him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in\\nwhich he conceals himself from pursuit. Jekyll had more than a father’s\\ninterest; Hyde had more than a son’s indifference. To cast in my lot\\nwith Jekyll, was to die to those appetites which I had long secretly\\nindulged and had of late begun to pamper. To cast it in with Hyde, was\\nto die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to become, at a\\nblow and forever, despised and friendless. The bargain might appear\\nunequal; but there was still another consideration in the scales; for\\nwhile Jekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, Hyde\\nwould be not even conscious of all that he had lost. Strange as my\\ncircumstances were, the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace\\nas man; much the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any\\ntempted and trembling sinner; and it fell out with me, as it falls with\\nso vast a majority of my fellows, that I chose the better part and was\\nfound wanting in the strength to keep to it.\\n\\nYes, I preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded by\\nfriends and cherishing honest hopes; and bade a resolute farewell to\\nthe liberty, the comparative youth, the light step, leaping impulses\\nand secret pleasures, that I had enjoyed in the disguise of Hyde. I\\nmade this choice perhaps with some unconscious reservation, for I\\nneither gave up the house in Soho, nor destroyed the clothes of Edward\\nHyde, which still lay ready in my cabinet. For two months, however, I\\nwas true to my determination; for two months, I led a life of such\\nseverity as I had never before attained to, and enjoyed the\\ncompensations of an approving conscience. But time began at last to\\nobliterate the freshness of my alarm; the praises of conscience began\\nto grow into a thing of course; I began to be tortured with throes and\\nlongings, as of Hyde struggling after freedom; and at last, in an hour\\nof moral weakness, I once again compounded and swallowed the\\ntransforming draught.\\n\\nI do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with himself upon his\\nvice, he is once out of five hundred times affected by the dangers that\\nhe runs through his brutish, physical insensibility; neither had I,\\nlong as I had considered my position, made enough allowance for the\\ncomplete moral insensibility and insensate readiness to evil, which\\nwere the leading characters of Edward Hyde. Yet it was by these that I\\nwas punished. My devil had been long caged, he came out roaring. I was\\nconscious, even when I took the draught, of a more unbridled, a more\\nfurious propensity to ill. It must have been this, I suppose, that\\nstirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to\\nthe civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God,\\nno man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so\\npitiful a provocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit\\nthan that in which a sick child may break a plaything. But I had\\nvoluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which\\neven the worst of us continues to walk with some degree of steadiness\\namong temptations; and in my case, to be tempted, however slightly, was\\nto fall.\\n\\nInstantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged. With a transport of\\nglee, I mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight from every blow;\\nand it was not till weariness had begun to succeed, that I was\\nsuddenly, in the top fit of my delirium, struck through the heart by a\\ncold thrill of terror. A mist dispersed; I saw my life to be forfeit;\\nand fled from the scene of these excesses, at once glorying and\\ntrembling, my lust of evil gratified and stimulated, my love of life\\nscrewed to the topmost peg. I ran to the house in Soho, and (to make\\nassurance doubly sure) destroyed my papers; thence I set out through\\nthe lamplit streets, in the same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating on\\nmy crime, light-headedly devising others in the future, and yet still\\nhastening and still hearkening in my wake for the steps of the avenger.\\nHyde had a song upon his lips as he compounded the draught, and as he\\ndrank it, pledged the dead man. The pangs of transformation had not\\ndone tearing him, before Henry Jekyll, with streaming tears of\\ngratitude and remorse, had fallen upon his knees and lifted his clasped\\nhands to God. The veil of self-indulgence was rent from head to foot. I\\nsaw my life as a whole: I followed it up from the days of childhood,\\nwhen I had walked with my father’s hand, and through the self-denying\\ntoils of my professional life, to arrive again and again, with the same\\nsense of unreality, at the damned horrors of the evening. I could have\\nscreamed aloud; I sought with tears and prayers to smother down the\\ncrowd of hideous images and sounds with which my memory swarmed against\\nme; and still, between the petitions, the ugly face of my iniquity\\nstared into my soul. As the acuteness of this remorse began to die\\naway, it was succeeded by a sense of joy. The problem of my conduct was\\nsolved. Hyde was thenceforth impossible; whether I would or not, I was\\nnow confined to the better part of my existence; and O, how I rejoiced\\nto think of it! with what willing humility I embraced anew the\\nrestrictions of natural life! with what sincere renunciation I locked\\nthe door by which I had so often gone and come, and ground the key\\nunder my heel!\\n\\nThe next day, came the news that the murder had not been overlooked,\\nthat the guilt of Hyde was patent to the world, and that the victim was\\na man high in public estimation. It was not only a crime, it had been a\\ntragic folly. I think I was glad to know it; I think I was glad to have\\nmy better impulses thus buttressed and guarded by the terrors of the\\nscaffold. Jekyll was now my city of refuge; let but Hyde peep out an\\ninstant, and the hands of all men would be raised to take and slay him.\\n\\nI resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past; and I can say with\\nhonesty that my resolve was fruitful of some good. You know yourself\\nhow earnestly, in the last months of the last year, I laboured to\\nrelieve suffering; you know that much was done for others, and that the\\ndays passed quietly, almost happily for myself. Nor can I truly say\\nthat I wearied of this beneficent and innocent life; I think instead\\nthat I daily enjoyed it more completely; but I was still cursed with my\\nduality of purpose; and as the first edge of my penitence wore off, the\\nlower side of me, so long indulged, so recently chained down, began to\\ngrowl for licence. Not that I dreamed of resuscitating Hyde; the bare\\nidea of that would startle me to frenzy: no, it was in my own person\\nthat I was once more tempted to trifle with my conscience; and it was\\nas an ordinary secret sinner that I at last fell before the assaults of\\ntemptation.\\n\\nThere comes an end to all things; the most capacious measure is filled\\nat last; and this brief condescension to my evil finally destroyed the\\nbalance of my soul. And yet I was not alarmed; the fall seemed natural,\\nlike a return to the old days before I had made my discovery. It was a\\nfine, clear, January day, wet under foot where the frost had melted,\\nbut cloudless overhead; and the Regent’s Park was full of winter\\nchirrupings and sweet with spring odours. I sat in the sun on a bench;\\nthe animal within me licking the chops of memory; the spiritual side a\\nlittle drowsed, promising subsequent penitence, but not yet moved to\\nbegin. After all, I reflected, I was like my neighbours; and then I\\nsmiled, comparing myself with other men, comparing my active good-will\\nwith the lazy cruelty of their neglect. And at the very moment of that\\nvainglorious thought, a qualm came over me, a horrid nausea and the\\nmost deadly shuddering. These passed away, and left me faint; and then\\nas in its turn faintness subsided, I began to be aware of a change in\\nthe temper of my thoughts, a greater boldness, a contempt of danger, a\\nsolution of the bonds of obligation. I looked down; my clothes hung\\nformlessly on my shrunken limbs; the hand that lay on my knee was\\ncorded and hairy. I was once more Edward Hyde. A moment before I had\\nbeen safe of all men’s respect, wealthy, beloved—the cloth laying for\\nme in the dining-room at home; and now I was the common quarry of\\nmankind, hunted, houseless, a known murderer, thrall to the gallows.\\n\\nMy reason wavered, but it did not fail me utterly. I have more than\\nonce observed that in my second character, my faculties seemed\\nsharpened to a point and my spirits more tensely elastic; thus it came\\nabout that, where Jekyll perhaps might have succumbed, Hyde rose to the\\nimportance of the moment. My drugs were in one of the presses of my\\ncabinet; how was I to reach them? That was the problem that (crushing\\nmy temples in my hands) I set myself to solve. The laboratory door I\\nhad closed. If I sought to enter by the house, my own servants would\\nconsign me to the gallows. I saw I must employ another hand, and\\nthought of Lanyon. How was he to be reached? how persuaded? Supposing\\nthat I escaped capture in the streets, how was I to make my way into\\nhis presence? and how should I, an unknown and displeasing visitor,\\nprevail on the famous physician to rifle the study of his colleague,\\nDr. Jekyll? Then I remembered that of my original character, one part\\nremained to me: I could write my own hand; and once I had conceived\\nthat kindling spark, the way that I must follow became lighted up from\\nend to end.\\n\\nThereupon, I arranged my clothes as best I could, and summoning a\\npassing hansom, drove to an hotel in Portland Street, the name of which\\nI chanced to remember. At my appearance (which was indeed comical\\nenough, however tragic a fate these garments covered) the driver could\\nnot conceal his mirth. I gnashed my teeth upon him with a gust of\\ndevilish fury; and the smile withered from his face—happily for him—yet\\nmore happily for myself, for in another instant I had certainly dragged\\nhim from his perch. At the inn, as I entered, I looked about me with so\\nblack a countenance as made the attendants tremble; not a look did they\\nexchange in my presence; but obsequiously took my orders, led me to a\\nprivate room, and brought me wherewithal to write. Hyde in danger of\\nhis life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate anger, strung\\nto the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain. Yet the creature was\\nastute; mastered his fury with a great effort of the will; composed his\\ntwo important letters, one to Lanyon and one to Poole; and that he\\nmight receive actual evidence of their being posted, sent them out with\\ndirections that they should be registered. Thenceforward, he sat all\\nday over the fire in the private room, gnawing his nails; there he\\ndined, sitting alone with his fears, the waiter visibly quailing before\\nhis eye; and thence, when the night was fully come, he set forth in the\\ncorner of a closed cab, and was driven to and fro about the streets of\\nthe city. He, I say—I cannot say, I. That child of Hell had nothing\\nhuman; nothing lived in him but fear and hatred. And when at last,\\nthinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious, he discharged the cab\\nand ventured on foot, attired in his misfitting clothes, an object\\nmarked out for observation, into the midst of the nocturnal passengers,\\nthese two base passions raged within him like a tempest. He walked\\nfast, hunted by his fears, chattering to himself, skulking through the\\nless frequented thoroughfares, counting the minutes that still divided\\nhim from midnight. Once a woman spoke to him, offering, I think, a box\\nof lights. He smote her in the face, and she fled.\\n\\nWhen I came to myself at Lanyon’s, the horror of my old friend perhaps\\naffected me somewhat: I do not know; it was at least but a drop in the\\nsea to the abhorrence with which I looked back upon these hours. A\\nchange had come over me. It was no longer the fear of the gallows, it\\nwas the horror of being Hyde that racked me. I received Lanyon’s\\ncondemnation partly in a dream; it was partly in a dream that I came\\nhome to my own house and got into bed. I slept after the prostration of\\nthe day, with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the\\nnightmares that wrung me could avail to break. I awoke in the morning\\nshaken, weakened, but refreshed. I still hated and feared the thought\\nof the brute that slept within me, and I had not of course forgotten\\nthe appalling dangers of the day before; but I was once more at home,\\nin my own house and close to my drugs; and gratitude for my escape\\nshone so strong in my soul that it almost rivalled the brightness of\\nhope.\\n\\nI was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast, drinking the\\nchill of the air with pleasure, when I was seized again with those\\nindescribable sensations that heralded the change; and I had but the\\ntime to gain the shelter of my cabinet, before I was once again raging\\nand freezing with the passions of Hyde. It took on this occasion a\\ndouble dose to recall me to myself; and alas! six hours after, as I sat\\nlooking sadly in the fire, the pangs returned, and the drug had to be\\nre-administered. In short, from that day forth it seemed only by a\\ngreat effort as of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulation\\nof the drug, that I was able to wear the countenance of Jekyll. At all\\nhours of the day and night, I would be taken with the premonitory\\nshudder; above all, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair,\\nit was always as Hyde that I awakened. Under the strain of this\\ncontinually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which I now\\ncondemned myself, ay, even beyond what I had thought possible to man, I\\nbecame, in my own person, a creature eaten up and emptied by fever,\\nlanguidly weak both in body and mind, and solely occupied by one\\nthought: the horror of my other self. But when I slept, or when the\\nvirtue of the medicine wore off, I would leap almost without transition\\n(for the pangs of transformation grew daily less marked) into the\\npossession of a fancy brimming with images of terror, a soul boiling\\nwith causeless hatreds, and a body that seemed not strong enough to\\ncontain the raging energies of life. The powers of Hyde seemed to have\\ngrown with the sickliness of Jekyll. And certainly the hate that now\\ndivided them was equal on each side. With Jekyll, it was a thing of\\nvital instinct. He had now seen the full deformity of that creature\\nthat shared with him some of the phenomena of consciousness, and was\\nco-heir with him to death: and beyond these links of community, which\\nin themselves made the most poignant part of his distress, he thought\\nof Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of something not only hellish\\nbut inorganic. This was the shocking thing; that the slime of the pit\\nseemed to utter cries and voices; that the amorphous dust gesticulated\\nand sinned; that what was dead, and had no shape, should usurp the\\noffices of life. And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit to\\nhim closer than a wife, closer than an eye; lay caged in his flesh,\\nwhere he heard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born; and at every\\nhour of weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed against\\nhim, and deposed him out of life. The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was of\\na different order. His terror of the gallows drove him continually to\\ncommit temporary suicide, and return to his subordinate station of a\\npart instead of a person; but he loathed the necessity, he loathed the\\ndespondency into which Jekyll was now fallen, and he resented the\\ndislike with which he was himself regarded. Hence the ape-like tricks\\nthat he would play me, scrawling in my own hand blasphemies on the\\npages of my books, burning the letters and destroying the portrait of\\nmy father; and indeed, had it not been for his fear of death, he would\\nlong ago have ruined himself in order to involve me in the ruin. But\\nhis love of life is wonderful; I go further: I, who sicken and freeze at\\nthe mere thought of him, when I recall the abjection and passion of\\nthis attachment, and when I know how he fears my power to cut him off\\nby suicide, I find it in my heart to pity him.\\n\\nIt is useless, and the time awfully fails me, to prolong this\\ndescription; no one has ever suffered such torments, let that suffice;\\nand yet even to these, habit brought—no, not alleviation—but a certain\\ncallousness of soul, a certain acquiescence of despair; and my\\npunishment might have gone on for years, but for the last calamity\\nwhich has now fallen, and which has finally severed me from my own face\\nand nature. My provision of the salt, which had never been renewed\\nsince the date of the first experiment, began to run low. I sent out\\nfor a fresh supply and mixed the draught; the ebullition followed, and\\nthe first change of colour, not the second; I drank it and it was\\nwithout efficiency. You will learn from Poole how I have had London\\nransacked; it was in vain; and I am now persuaded that my first supply\\nwas impure, and that it was that unknown impurity which lent efficacy\\nto the draught.\\n\\nAbout a week has passed, and I am now finishing this statement under\\nthe influence of the last of the old powders. This, then, is the last\\ntime, short of a miracle, that Henry Jekyll can think his own thoughts\\nor see his own face (now how sadly altered!) in the glass. Nor must I\\ndelay too long to bring my writing to an end; for if my narrative has\\nhitherto escaped destruction, it has been by a combination of great\\nprudence and great good luck. Should the throes of change take me in\\nthe act of writing it, Hyde will tear it in pieces; but if some time\\nshall have elapsed after I have laid it by, his wonderful selfishness\\nand circumscription to the moment will probably save it once again from\\nthe action of his ape-like spite. And indeed the doom that is closing\\non us both has already changed and crushed him. Half an hour from now,\\nwhen I shall again and forever reindue that hated personality, I know\\nhow I shall sit shuddering and weeping in my chair, or continue, with\\nthe most strained and fearstruck ecstasy of listening, to pace up and\\ndown this room (my last earthly refuge) and give ear to every sound of\\nmenace. Will Hyde die upon the scaffold? or will he find courage to\\nrelease himself at the last moment? God knows; I am careless; this is\\nmy true hour of death, and what is to follow concerns another than\\nmyself. Here then, as I lay down the pen and proceed to seal up my\\nconfession, I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end.\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 43 ***\"}\n",

Frank Baum\\nChicago, April, 1900.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter I\\nThe Cyclone\\n\\n\\nDorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle\\nHenry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer’s wife. Their\\nhouse was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon\\nmany miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one\\nroom; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for\\nthe dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry\\nand Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in\\nanother corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar—except a\\nsmall hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family\\ncould go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to\\ncrush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the\\nmiddle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark\\nhole.\\n\\nWhen Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see\\nnothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a\\nhouse broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of\\nthe sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a\\ngray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was\\nnot green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until\\nthey were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had\\nbeen painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it\\naway, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.\\n\\nWhen Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun\\nand wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes\\nand left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and\\nlips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled\\nnow. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had\\nbeen so startled by the child’s laughter that she would scream and\\npress her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy’s merry voice reached\\nher ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she\\ncould find anything to laugh at.\\n\\nUncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and\\ndid not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his\\nrough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.\\n\\nIt was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray\\nas her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little black\\ndog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on\\neither side of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and\\nDorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.\\n\\nToday, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the\\ndoorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than\\nusual. Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at\\nthe sky too. Aunt Em was washing the dishes.\\n\\nFrom the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry\\nand Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the\\ncoming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the\\nsouth, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the\\ngrass coming from that direction also.\\n\\nSuddenly Uncle Henry stood up.\\n\\n“There’s a cyclone coming, Em,” he called to his wife. “I’ll go look\\nafter the stock.” Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and\\nhorses were kept.\\n\\nAunt Em dropped her work and came to the door. One glance told her of\\nthe danger close at hand.\\n\\n“Quick, Dorothy!” she screamed. “Run for the cellar!”\\n\\nToto jumped out of Dorothy’s arms and hid under the bed, and the girl\\nstarted to get him. Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap door\\nin the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark hole.\\nDorothy caught Toto at last and started to follow her aunt. When she\\nwas halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the wind,\\nand the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down\\nsuddenly upon the floor.\\n\\nThen a strange thing happened.\\n\\nThe house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the\\nair. Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.\\n\\nThe north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the\\nexact center of the cyclone. In the middle of a cyclone the air is\\ngenerally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of\\nthe house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very top\\nof the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and miles\\naway as easily as you could carry a feather.\\n\\nIt was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy\\nfound she was riding quite easily. After the first few whirls around,\\nand one other time when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were\\nbeing rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle.\\n\\nToto did not like it. He ran about the room, now here, now there,\\nbarking loudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to\\nsee what would happen.\\n\\nOnce Toto got too near the open trap door, and fell in; and at first\\nthe little girl thought she had lost him. But soon she saw one of his\\nears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air\\nwas keeping him up so that he could not fall. She crept to the hole,\\ncaught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the room again, afterward\\nclosing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen.\\n\\nHour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright;\\nbut she felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about\\nher that she nearly became deaf. At first she had wondered if she would\\nbe dashed to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours passed\\nand nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and resolved to\\nwait calmly and see what the future would bring. At last she crawled\\nover the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it; and Toto\\nfollowed and lay down beside her.\\n\\nIn spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind,\\nDorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter II\\nThe Council with the Munchkins\\n\\n\\nShe was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had\\nnot been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt. As it was, the\\njar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened; and Toto\\nput his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally. Dorothy sat\\nup and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it dark, for the\\nbright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the little room. She\\nsprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran and opened the door.\\n\\nThe little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes\\ngrowing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw.\\n\\nThe cyclone had set the house down very gently—for a cyclone—in the\\nmidst of a country of marvelous beauty. There were lovely patches of\\ngreensward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious\\nfruits. Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with\\nrare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes.\\nA little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling along between\\ngreen banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl\\nwho had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.\\n\\nWhile she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights,\\nshe noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had\\never seen. They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been\\nused to; but neither were they very small. In fact, they seemed about\\nas tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although\\nthey were, so far as looks go, many years older.\\n\\nThree were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They wore\\nround hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with\\nlittle bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The\\nhats of the men were blue; the little woman’s hat was white, and she\\nwore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders. Over it were\\nsprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds. The men\\nwere dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore\\nwell-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops. The men,\\nDorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had\\nbeards. But the little woman was doubtless much older. Her face was\\ncovered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather\\nstiffly.\\n\\nWhen these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the\\ndoorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to\\ncome farther. But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low\\nbow and said, in a sweet voice:\\n\\n“You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins.\\nWe are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the\\nEast, and for setting our people free from bondage.”\\n\\nDorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little\\nwoman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had\\nkilled the Wicked Witch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless\\nlittle girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home;\\nand she had never killed anything in all her life.\\n\\nBut the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said,\\nwith hesitation, “You are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I\\nhave not killed anything.”\\n\\n“Your house did, anyway,” replied the little old woman, with a laugh,\\n“and that is the same thing. See!” she continued, pointing to the\\ncorner of the house. “There are her two feet, still sticking out from\\nunder a block of wood.”\\n\\nDorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright. There, indeed, just\\nunder the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were\\nsticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.\\n\\n“Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in\\ndismay. “The house must have fallen on her. Whatever shall we do?”\\n\\n“There is nothing to be done,” said the little woman calmly.\\n\\n“But who was she?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,” answered the little\\nwoman. “She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years,\\nmaking them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set free, and\\nare grateful to you for the favor.”\\n\\n“Who are the Munchkins?” inquired Dorothy.\\n\\n“They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked\\nWitch ruled.”\\n\\n“Are you a Munchkin?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.\\nWhen they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift\\nmessenger to me, and I came at once. I am the Witch of the North.”\\n\\n“Oh, gracious!” cried Dorothy. “Are you a real witch?”\\n\\n“Yes, indeed,” answered the little woman. “But I am a good witch, and\\nthe people love me. I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was who\\nruled here, or I should have set the people free myself.”\\n\\n“But I thought all witches were wicked,” said the girl, who was half\\nfrightened at facing a real witch.\\n\\n“Oh, no, that is a great mistake. There were only four witches in all\\nthe Land of Oz, and two of them, those who live in the North and the\\nSouth, are good witches. I know this is true, for I am one of them\\nmyself, and cannot be mistaken. Those who dwelt in the East and the\\nWest were, indeed, wicked witches; but now that you have killed one of\\nthem, there is but one Wicked Witch in all the Land of Oz—the one who\\nlives in the West.”\\n\\n“But,” said Dorothy, after a moment’s thought, “Aunt Em has told me\\nthat the witches were all dead—years and years ago.”\\n\\n“Who is Aunt Em?” inquired the little old woman.\\n\\n“She is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from.”\\n\\nThe Witch of the North seemed to think for a time, with her head bowed\\nand her eyes upon the ground. Then she looked up and said, “I do not\\nknow where Kansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned\\nbefore. But tell me, is it a civilized country?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes,” replied Dorothy.\\n\\n“Then that accounts for it. In the civilized countries I believe there\\nare no witches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians. But,\\nyou see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off\\nfrom all the rest of the world. Therefore we still have witches and\\nwizards amongst us.”\\n\\n“Who are the wizards?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“Oz himself is the Great Wizard,” answered the Witch, sinking her voice\\nto a whisper. “He is more powerful than all the rest of us together. He\\nlives in the City of Emeralds.”\\n\\nDorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins,\\nwho had been standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the\\ncorner of the house where the Wicked Witch had been lying.\\n\\n“What is it?” asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to\\nlaugh. The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and nothing\\nwas left but the silver shoes.\\n\\n“She was so old,” explained the Witch of the North, “that she dried up\\nquickly in the sun. That is the end of her. But the silver shoes are\\nyours, and you shall have them to wear.” She reached down and picked up\\nthe shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to\\nDorothy.\\n\\n“The Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes,” said one of\\nthe Munchkins, “and there is some charm connected with them; but what\\nit is we never knew.”\\n\\nDorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table.\\nThen she came out again to the Munchkins and said:\\n\\n“I am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they will\\nworry about me. Can you help me find my way?”\\n\\nThe Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at\\nDorothy, and then shook their heads.\\n\\n“At the East, not far from here,” said one, “there is a great desert,\\nand none could live to cross it.”\\n\\n“It is the same at the South,” said another, “for I have been there and\\nseen it. The South is the country of the Quadlings.”\\n\\n“I am told,” said the third man, “that it is the same at the West. And\\nthat country, where the Winkies live, is ruled by the Wicked Witch of\\nthe West, who would make you her slave if you passed her way.”\\n\\n“The North is my home,” said the old lady, “and at its edge is the same\\ngreat desert that surrounds this Land of Oz. I’m afraid, my dear, you\\nwill have to live with us.”\\n\\nDorothy began to sob at this, for she felt lonely among all these\\nstrange people. Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins,\\nfor they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep\\nalso. As for the little old woman, she took off her cap and balanced\\nthe point on the end of her nose, while she counted “One, two, three”\\nin a solemn voice. At once the cap changed to a slate, on which was\\nwritten in big, white chalk marks:\\n\\n“LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS”\\n\\n\\nThe little old woman took the slate from her nose, and having read the\\nwords on it, asked, “Is your name Dorothy, my dear?”\\n\\n“Yes,” answered the child, looking up and drying her tears.\\n\\n“Then you must go to the City of Emeralds. Perhaps Oz will help you.”\\n\\n“Where is this city?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“It is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, the\\nGreat Wizard I told you of.”\\n\\n“Is he a good man?” inquired the girl anxiously.\\n\\n“He is a good Wizard. Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I\\nhave never seen him.”\\n\\n“How can I get there?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“You must walk. It is a long journey, through a country that is\\nsometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible. However, I will use\\nall the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm.”\\n\\n“Won’t you go with me?” pleaded the girl, who had begun to look upon\\nthe little old woman as her only friend.\\n\\n“No, I cannot do that,” she replied, “but I will give you my kiss, and\\nno one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of\\nthe North.”\\n\\nShe came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead. Where\\nher lips touched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as Dorothy\\nfound out soon after.\\n\\n“The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick,” said the\\nWitch, “so you cannot miss it. When you get to Oz do not be afraid of\\nhim, but tell your story and ask him to help you. Good-bye, my dear.”\\n\\nThe three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey,\\nafter which they walked away through the trees. The Witch gave Dorothy\\na friendly little nod, whirled around on her left heel three times, and\\nstraightway disappeared, much to the surprise of little Toto, who\\nbarked after her loudly enough when she had gone, because he had been\\nafraid even to growl while she stood by.\\n\\nBut Dorothy, knowing her to be a witch, had expected her to disappear\\nin just that way, and was not surprised in the least.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter III\\nHow Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow\\n\\n\\nWhen Dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry. So she went to\\nthe cupboard and cut herself some bread, which she spread with butter.\\nShe gave some to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it\\ndown to the little brook and filled it with clear, sparkling water.\\nToto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting\\nthere. Dorothy went to get him, and saw such delicious fruit hanging\\nfrom the branches that she gathered some of it, finding it just what\\nshe wanted to help out her breakfast.\\n\\nThen she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to\\na good drink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready for\\nthe journey to the City of Emeralds.\\n\\nDorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was\\nhanging on a peg beside her bed. It was gingham, with checks of white\\nand blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings,\\nit was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed\\nherself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head.\\nShe took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard,\\nlaying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and\\nnoticed how old and worn her shoes were.\\n\\n“They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,” she said. And\\nToto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his\\ntail to show he knew what she meant.\\n\\nAt that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had\\nbelonged to the Witch of the East.\\n\\n“I wonder if they will fit me,” she said to Toto. “They would be just\\nthe thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.”\\n\\nShe took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which\\nfitted her as well as if they had been made for her.\\n\\nFinally she picked up her basket.\\n\\n“Come along, Toto,” she said. “We will go to the Emerald City and ask\\nthe Great Oz how to get back to Kansas again.”\\n\\nShe closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the pocket\\nof her dress. And so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind her, she\\nstarted on her journey.\\n\\nThere were several roads nearby, but it did not take her long to find\\nthe one paved with yellow bricks. Within a short time she was walking\\nbriskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on\\nthe hard, yellow road-bed. The sun shone bright and the birds sang\\nsweetly, and Dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a\\nlittle girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own\\ncountry and set down in the midst of a strange land.\\n\\nShe was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country\\nwas about her. There were neat fences at the sides of the road, painted\\na dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and\\nvegetables in abundance. Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and\\nable to raise large crops. Once in a while she would pass a house, and\\nthe people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by; for\\neveryone knew she had been the means of destroying the Wicked Witch and\\nsetting them free from bondage. The houses of the Munchkins were\\nodd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a roof.\\nAll were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was the\\nfavorite color.\\n\\nToward evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to\\nwonder where she should pass the night, she came to a house rather\\nlarger than the rest. On the green lawn before it many men and women\\nwere dancing. Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible, and\\nthe people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was\\nloaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other\\ngood things to eat.\\n\\nThe people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her to supper and to\\npass the night with them; for this was the home of one of the richest\\nMunchkins in the land, and his friends were gathered with him to\\ncelebrate their freedom from the bondage of the Wicked Witch.\\n\\nDorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin\\nhimself, whose name was Boq. Then she sat upon a settee and watched the\\npeople dance.\\n\\nWhen Boq saw her silver shoes he said, “You must be a great sorceress.”\\n\\n“Why?” asked the girl.\\n\\n“Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch.\\nBesides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses\\nwear white.”\\n\\n“My dress is blue and white checked,” said Dorothy, smoothing out the\\nwrinkles in it.\\n\\n“It is kind of you to wear that,” said Boq. “Blue is the color of the\\nMunchkins, and white is the witch color. So we know you are a friendly\\nwitch.”\\n\\nDorothy did not know what to say to this, for all the people seemed to\\nthink her a witch, and she knew very well she was only an ordinary\\nlittle girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange\\nland.\\n\\nWhen she had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her into the house,\\nwhere he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it. The sheets were made\\nof blue cloth, and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning, with\\nToto curled up on the blue rug beside her.\\n\\nShe ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a wee Munchkin baby, who played\\nwith Toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that\\ngreatly amused Dorothy. Toto was a fine curiosity to all the people,\\nfor they had never seen a dog before.\\n\\n“How far is it to the Emerald City?” the girl asked.\\n\\n“I do not know,” answered Boq gravely, “for I have never been there. It\\nis better for people to keep away from Oz, unless they have business\\nwith him. But it is a long way to the Emerald City, and it will take\\nyou many days. The country here is rich and pleasant, but you must pass\\nthrough rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your\\njourney.”\\n\\nThis worried Dorothy a little, but she knew that only the Great Oz\\ncould help her get to Kansas again, so she bravely resolved not to turn\\nback.\\n\\nShe bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of\\nyellow brick. When she had gone several miles she thought she would\\nstop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road\\nand sat down. There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far\\naway she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from\\nthe ripe corn.\\n\\nDorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the\\nScarecrow. Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes,\\nnose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue\\nhat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and\\nthe rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded,\\nwhich had also been stuffed with straw. On the feet were some old boots\\nwith blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure\\nwas raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its\\nback.\\n\\nWhile Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the\\nScarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her.\\nShe thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the\\nscarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its\\nhead to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and\\nwalked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.\\n\\n“Good day,” said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice.\\n\\n“Did you speak?” asked the girl, in wonder.\\n\\n“Certainly,” answered the Scarecrow. “How do you do?”\\n\\n“I’m pretty well, thank you,” replied Dorothy politely. “How do you\\ndo?”\\n\\n“I’m not feeling well,” said the Scarecrow, with a smile, “for it is\\nvery tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.”\\n\\n“Can’t you get down?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“No, for this pole is stuck up my back. If you will please take away\\nthe pole I shall be greatly obliged to you.”\\n\\nDorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole, for,\\nbeing stuffed with straw, it was quite light.\\n\\n“Thank you very much,” said the Scarecrow, when he had been set down on\\nthe ground. “I feel like a new man.”\\n\\nDorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man\\nspeak, and to see him bow and walk along beside her.\\n\\n“Who are you?” asked the Scarecrow when he had stretched himself and\\nyawned. “And where are you going?”\\n\\n“My name is Dorothy,” said the girl, “and I am going to the Emerald\\nCity, to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas.”\\n\\n“Where is the Emerald City?” he inquired. “And who is Oz?”\\n\\n“Why, don’t you know?” she returned, in surprise.\\n\\n“No, indeed. I don’t know anything. You see, I am stuffed, so I have no\\nbrains at all,” he answered sadly.\\n\\n“Oh,” said Dorothy, “I’m awfully sorry for you.”\\n\\n“Do you think,” he asked, “if I go to the Emerald City with you, that\\nOz would give me some brains?”\\n\\n“I cannot tell,” she returned, “but you may come with me, if you like.\\nIf Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you\\nare now.”\\n\\n“That is true,” said the Scarecrow. “You see,” he continued\\nconfidentially, “I don’t mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed,\\nbecause I cannot get hurt. If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin\\ninto me, it doesn’t matter, for I can’t feel it. But I do not want\\npeople to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw\\ninstead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?”\\n\\n“I understand how you feel,” said the little girl, who was truly sorry\\nfor him. “If you will come with me I’ll ask Oz to do all he can for\\nyou.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” he answered gratefully.\\n\\nThey walked back to the road. Dorothy helped him over the fence, and\\nthey started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City.\\n\\nToto did not like this addition to the party at first. He smelled\\naround the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats\\nin the straw, and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the\\nScarecrow.\\n\\n“Don’t mind Toto,” said Dorothy to her new friend. “He never bites.”\\n\\n“Oh, I’m not afraid,” replied the Scarecrow. “He can’t hurt the straw.\\nDo let me carry that basket for you. I shall not mind it, for I can’t\\nget tired. I’ll tell you a secret,” he continued, as he walked along.\\n“There is only one thing in the world I am afraid of.”\\n\\n“What is that?” asked Dorothy; “the Munchkin farmer who made you?”\\n\\n“No,” answered the Scarecrow; “it’s a lighted match.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter IV\\nThe Road Through the Forest\\n\\n\\nAfter a few hours the road began to be rough, and the walking grew so\\ndifficult that the Scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks,\\nwhich were here very uneven. Sometimes, indeed, they were broken or\\nmissing altogether, leaving holes that Toto jumped across and Dorothy\\nwalked around. As for the Scarecrow, having no brains, he walked\\nstraight ahead, and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length\\non the hard bricks. It never hurt him, however, and Dorothy would pick\\nhim up and set him upon his feet again, while he joined her in laughing\\nmerrily at his own mishap.\\n\\nThe farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther\\nback. There were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees, and the farther\\nthey went the more dismal and lonesome the country became.\\n\\nAt noon they sat down by the roadside, near a little brook, and Dorothy\\nopened her basket and got out some bread. She offered a piece to the\\nScarecrow, but he refused.\\n\\n“I am never hungry,” he said, “and it is a lucky thing I am not, for my\\nmouth is only painted, and if I should cut a hole in it so I could eat,\\nthe straw I am stuffed with would come out, and that would spoil the\\nshape of my head.”\\n\\nDorothy saw at once that this was true, so she only nodded and went on\\neating her bread.\\n\\n“Tell me something about yourself and the country you came from,” said\\nthe Scarecrow, when she had finished her dinner. So she told him all\\nabout Kansas, and how gray everything was there, and how the cyclone\\nhad carried her to this queer Land of Oz.\\n\\nThe Scarecrow listened carefully, and said, “I cannot understand why\\nyou should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry,\\ngray place you call Kansas.”\\n\\n“That is because you have no brains” answered the girl. “No matter how\\ndreary and gray our homes are, we people of flesh and blood would\\nrather live there than in any other country, be it ever so beautiful.\\nThere is no place like home.”\\n\\nThe Scarecrow sighed.\\n\\n“Of course I cannot understand it,” he said. “If your heads were\\nstuffed with straw, like mine, you would probably all live in the\\nbeautiful places, and then Kansas would have no people at all. It is\\nfortunate for Kansas that you have brains.”\\n\\n“Won’t you tell me a story, while we are resting?” asked the child.\\n\\nThe Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully, and answered:\\n\\n“My life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever. I was\\nonly made day before yesterday. What happened in the world before that\\ntime is all unknown to me. Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one\\nof the first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what\\nwas going on. There was another Munchkin with him, and the first thing\\nI heard was the farmer saying, ‘How do you like those ears?’\\n\\n“‘They aren’t straight,’” answered the other.\\n\\n“‘Never mind,’” said the farmer. “‘They are ears just the same,’” which\\nwas true enough.\\n\\n“‘Now I’ll make the eyes,’” said the farmer. So he painted my right\\neye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and\\nat everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was my\\nfirst glimpse of the world.\\n\\n“‘That’s a rather pretty eye,’” remarked the Munchkin who was watching\\nthe farmer. “‘Blue paint is just the color for eyes.’\\n\\n“‘I think I’ll make the other a little bigger,’” said the farmer. And\\nwhen the second eye was done I could see much better than before. Then\\nhe made my nose and my mouth. But I did not speak, because at that time\\nI didn’t know what a mouth was for. I had the fun of watching them make\\nmy body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my head, at\\nlast, I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a man as\\nanyone.\\n\\n“‘This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,’ said the farmer. ‘He\\nlooks just like a man.’\\n\\n“‘Why, he is a man,’ said the other, and I quite agreed with him. The\\nfarmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a\\ntall stick, where you found me. He and his friend soon after walked\\naway and left me alone.\\n\\n“I did not like to be deserted this way. So I tried to walk after them.\\nBut my feet would not touch the ground, and I was forced to stay on\\nthat pole. It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think of,\\nhaving been made such a little while before. Many crows and other birds\\nflew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they flew away\\nagain, thinking I was a Munchkin; and this pleased me and made me feel\\nthat I was quite an important person. By and by an old crow flew near\\nme, and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and\\nsaid:\\n\\n“‘I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner. Any\\ncrow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw.’ Then he\\nhopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted. The other birds,\\nseeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too, so in a short\\ntime there was a great flock of them about me.\\n\\n“I felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow\\nafter all; but the old crow comforted me, saying, ‘If you only had\\nbrains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a\\nbetter man than some of them. Brains are the only things worth having\\nin this world, no matter whether one is a crow or a man.’\\n\\n“After the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would try\\nhard to get some brains. By good luck you came along and pulled me off\\nthe stake, and from what you say I am sure the Great Oz will give me\\nbrains as soon as we get to the Emerald City.”\\n\\n“I hope so,” said Dorothy earnestly, “since you seem anxious to have\\nthem.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes; I am anxious,” returned the Scarecrow. “It is such an\\nuncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool.”\\n\\n“Well,” said the girl, “let us go.” And she handed the basket to the\\nScarecrow.\\n\\nThere were no fences at all by the roadside now, and the land was rough\\nand untilled. Toward evening they came to a great forest, where the\\ntrees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the\\nroad of yellow brick. It was almost dark under the trees, for the\\nbranches shut out the daylight; but the travelers did not stop, and\\nwent on into the forest.\\n\\n“If this road goes in, it must come out,” said the Scarecrow, “and as\\nthe Emerald City is at the other end of the road, we must go wherever\\nit leads us.”\\n\\n“Anyone would know that,” said Dorothy.\\n\\n“Certainly; that is why I know it,” returned the Scarecrow. “If it\\nrequired brains to figure it out, I never should have said it.”\\n\\nAfter an hour or so the light faded away, and they found themselves\\nstumbling along in the darkness. Dorothy could not see at all, but Toto\\ncould, for some dogs see very well in the dark; and the Scarecrow\\ndeclared he could see as well as by day. So she took hold of his arm\\nand managed to get along fairly well.\\n\\n“If you see any house, or any place where we can pass the night,” she\\nsaid, “you must tell me; for it is very uncomfortable walking in the\\ndark.”\\n\\nSoon after the Scarecrow stopped.\\n\\n“I see a little cottage at the right of us,” he said, “built of logs\\nand branches. Shall we go there?”\\n\\n“Yes, indeed,” answered the child. “I am all tired out.”\\n\\nSo the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the\\ncottage, and Dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one\\ncorner. She lay down at once, and with Toto beside her soon fell into a\\nsound sleep. The Scarecrow, who was never tired, stood up in another\\ncorner and waited patiently until morning came.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter V\\nThe Rescue of the Tin Woodman\\n\\n\\nWhen Dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and Toto had\\nlong been out chasing birds around him and squirrels. She sat up and\\nlooked around her. There was the Scarecrow, still standing patiently in\\nhis corner, waiting for her.\\n\\n“We must go and search for water,” she said to him.\\n\\n“Why do you want water?” he asked.\\n\\n“To wash my face clean after the dust of the road, and to drink, so the\\ndry bread will not stick in my throat.”\\n\\n“It must be inconvenient to be made of flesh,” said the Scarecrow\\nthoughtfully, “for you must sleep, and eat and drink. However, you have\\nbrains, and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly.”\\n\\nThey left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a\\nlittle spring of clear water, where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate\\nher breakfast. She saw there was not much bread left in the basket, and\\nthe girl was thankful the Scarecrow did not have to eat anything, for\\nthere was scarcely enough for herself and Toto for the day.\\n\\nWhen she had finished her meal, and was about to go back to the road of\\nyellow brick, she was startled to hear a deep groan near by.\\n\\n“What was that?” she asked timidly.\\n\\n“I cannot imagine,” replied the Scarecrow; “but we can go and see.”\\n\\nJust then another groan reached their ears, and the sound seemed to\\ncome from behind them. They turned and walked through the forest a few\\nsteps, when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine\\nthat fell between the trees. She ran to the place and then stopped\\nshort, with a little cry of surprise.\\n\\nOne of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing\\nbeside it, with an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely\\nof tin. His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he\\nstood perfectly motionless, as if he could not stir at all.\\n\\nDorothy looked at him in amazement, and so did the Scarecrow, while\\nToto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs, which hurt his\\nteeth.\\n\\n“Did you groan?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“Yes,” answered the tin man, “I did. I’ve been groaning for more than a\\nyear, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me.”\\n\\n“What can I do for you?” she inquired softly, for she was moved by the\\nsad voice in which the man spoke.\\n\\n“Get an oil-can and oil my joints,” he answered. “They are rusted so\\nbadly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon\\nbe all right again. You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage.”\\n\\nDorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then\\nshe returned and asked anxiously, “Where are your joints?”\\n\\n“Oil my neck, first,” replied the Tin Woodman. So she oiled it, and as\\nit was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and\\nmoved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the\\nman could turn it himself.\\n\\n“Now oil the joints in my arms,” he said. And Dorothy oiled them and\\nthe Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust\\nand as good as new.\\n\\nThe Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe, which\\nhe leaned against the tree.\\n\\n“This is a great comfort,” he said. “I have been holding that axe in\\nthe air ever since I rusted, and I’m glad to be able to put it down at\\nlast. Now, if you will oil the joints of my legs, I shall be all right\\nonce more.”\\n\\nSo they oiled his legs until he could move them freely; and he thanked\\nthem again and again for his release, for he seemed a very polite\\ncreature, and very grateful.\\n\\n“I might have stood there always if you had not come along,” he said;\\n“so you have certainly saved my life. How did you happen to be here?”\\n\\n“We are on our way to the Emerald City to see the Great Oz,” she\\nanswered, “and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night.”\\n\\n“Why do you wish to see Oz?” he asked.\\n\\n“I want him to send me back to Kansas, and the Scarecrow wants him to\\nput a few brains into his head,” she replied.\\n\\nThe Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment. Then he said:\\n\\n“Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart?”\\n\\n“Why, I guess so,” Dorothy answered. “It would be as easy as to give\\nthe Scarecrow brains.”\\n\\n“True,” the Tin Woodman returned. “So, if you will allow me to join\\nyour party, I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me.”\\n\\n“Come along,” said the Scarecrow heartily, and Dorothy added that she\\nwould be pleased to have his company. So the Tin Woodman shouldered his\\naxe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road\\nthat was paved with yellow brick.\\n\\nThe Tin Woodman had asked Dorothy to put the oil-can in her basket.\\n“For,” he said, “if I should get caught in the rain, and rust again, I\\nwould need the oil-can badly.”\\n\\nIt was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party, for\\nsoon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place\\nwhere the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the\\ntravelers could not pass. But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe\\nand chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire\\nparty.\\n\\nDorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not\\nnotice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the\\nside of the road. Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up\\nagain.\\n\\n“Why didn’t you walk around the hole?” asked the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“I don’t know enough,” replied the Scarecrow cheerfully. “My head is\\nstuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to Oz to ask\\nhim for some brains.”\\n\\n“Oh, I see,” said the Tin Woodman. “But, after all, brains are not the\\nbest things in the world.”\\n\\n“Have you any?” inquired the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“No, my head is quite empty,” answered the Woodman. “But once I had\\nbrains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much\\nrather have a heart.”\\n\\n“And why is that?” asked the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“I will tell you my story, and then you will know.”\\n\\nSo, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told\\nthe following story:\\n\\n“I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest\\nand sold the wood for a living. When I grew up, I too became a\\nwood-chopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as\\nlong as she lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone\\nI would marry, so that I might not become lonely.\\n\\n“There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon\\ngrew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised to marry\\nme as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for\\nher; so I set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived with an old\\nwoman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she\\nwished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the\\nhousework. So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and\\npromised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage.\\nThereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping\\naway at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my\\nwife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my\\nleft leg.\\n\\n“This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man\\ncould not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tinsmith and\\nhad him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I\\nwas used to it. But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for\\nshe had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin\\ngirl. When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right\\nleg. Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of\\ntin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other;\\nbut, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones. The Wicked\\nWitch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I\\nthought that was the end of me. But the tinsmith happened to come\\nalong, and he made me a new head out of tin.\\n\\n“I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than\\never; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a\\nnew way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my\\naxe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into\\ntwo halves. Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body\\nof tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of\\njoints, so that I could move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had\\nnow no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did\\nnot care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is still living\\nwith the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.\\n\\n“My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and\\nit did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There\\nwas only one danger—that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in\\nmy cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However,\\nthere came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a\\nrainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I\\nwas left to stand in the woods until you came to help me. It was a\\nterrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time\\nto think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart.\\nWhile I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can\\nlove who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me\\none. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her.”\\n\\nBoth Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story\\nof the Tin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a\\nnew heart.\\n\\n“All the same,” said the Scarecrow, “I shall ask for brains instead of\\na heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had\\none.”\\n\\n“I shall take the heart,” returned the Tin Woodman; “for brains do not\\nmake one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world.”\\n\\nDorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her\\ntwo friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to\\nKansas and Aunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had\\nno brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.\\n\\nWhat worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another\\nmeal for herself and Toto would empty the basket. To be sure, neither\\nthe Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever ate anything, but she was not made\\nof tin nor straw, and could not live unless she was fed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VI\\nThe Cowardly Lion\\n\\n\\nAll this time Dorothy and her companions had been walking through the\\nthick woods. The road was still paved with yellow brick, but these were\\nmuch covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees, and the\\nwalking was not at all good.\\n\\nThere were few birds in this part of the forest, for birds love the\\nopen country where there is plenty of sunshine. But now and then there\\ncame a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees. These\\nsounds made the little girl’s heart beat fast, for she did not know\\nwhat made them; but Toto knew, and he walked close to Dorothy’s side,\\nand did not even bark in return.\\n\\n“How long will it be,” the child asked of the Tin Woodman, “before we\\nare out of the forest?”\\n\\n“I cannot tell,” was the answer, “for I have never been to the Emerald\\nCity. But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he said it\\nwas a long journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the\\ncity where Oz dwells the country is beautiful. But I am not afraid so\\nlong as I have my oil-can, and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow, while\\nyou bear upon your forehead the mark of the Good Witch’s kiss, and that\\nwill protect you from harm.”\\n\\n“But Toto!” said the girl anxiously. “What will protect him?”\\n\\n“We must protect him ourselves if he is in danger,” replied the Tin\\nWoodman.\\n\\nJust as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar, and the\\nnext moment a great Lion bounded into the road. With one blow of his\\npaw he sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the\\nroad, and then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws. But,\\nto the Lion’s surprise, he could make no impression on the tin,\\nalthough the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still.\\n\\nLittle Toto, now that he had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the\\nLion, and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog, when\\nDorothy, fearing Toto would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed\\nforward and slapped the Lion upon his nose as hard as she could, while\\nshe cried out:\\n\\n“Don’t you dare to bite Toto! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a\\nbig beast like you, to bite a poor little dog!”\\n\\n“I didn’t bite him,” said the Lion, as he rubbed his nose with his paw\\nwhere Dorothy had hit it.\\n\\n“No, but you tried to,” she retorted. “You are nothing but a big\\ncoward.”\\n\\n“I know it,” said the Lion, hanging his head in shame. “I’ve always\\nknown it. But how can I help it?”\\n\\n“I don’t know, I’m sure. To think of your striking a stuffed man, like\\nthe poor Scarecrow!”\\n\\n“Is he stuffed?” asked the Lion in surprise, as he watched her pick up\\nthe Scarecrow and set him upon his feet, while she patted him into\\nshape again.\\n\\n“Of course he’s stuffed,” replied Dorothy, who was still angry.\\n\\n“That’s why he went over so easily,” remarked the Lion. “It astonished\\nme to see him whirl around so. Is the other one stuffed also?”\\n\\n“No,” said Dorothy, “he’s made of tin.” And she helped the Woodman up\\nagain.\\n\\n“That’s why he nearly blunted my claws,” said the Lion. “When they\\nscratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back. What\\nis that little animal you are so tender of?”\\n\\n“He is my dog, Toto,” answered Dorothy.\\n\\n“Is he made of tin, or stuffed?” asked the Lion.\\n\\n“Neither. He’s a—a—a meat dog,” said the girl.\\n\\n“Oh! He’s a curious animal and seems remarkably small, now that I look\\nat him. No one would think of biting such a little thing, except a\\ncoward like me,” continued the Lion sadly.\\n\\n“What makes you a coward?” asked Dorothy, looking at the great beast in\\nwonder, for he was as big as a small horse.\\n\\n“It’s a mystery,” replied the Lion. “I suppose I was born that way. All\\nthe other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave, for\\nthe Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts. I learned that\\nif I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out\\nof my way. Whenever I’ve met a man I’ve been awfully scared; but I just\\nroared at him, and he has always run away as fast as he could go. If\\nthe elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me,\\nI should have run myself—I’m such a coward; but just as soon as they\\nhear me roar they all try to get away from me, and of course I let them\\ngo.”\\n\\n“But that isn’t right. The King of Beasts shouldn’t be a coward,” said\\nthe Scarecrow.\\n\\n“I know it,” returned the Lion, wiping a tear from his eye with the tip\\nof his tail. “It is my great sorrow, and makes my life very unhappy.\\nBut whenever there is danger, my heart begins to beat fast.”\\n\\n“Perhaps you have heart disease,” said the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“It may be,” said the Lion.\\n\\n“If you have,” continued the Tin Woodman, “you ought to be glad, for it\\nproves you have a heart. For my part, I have no heart; so I cannot have\\nheart disease.”\\n\\n“Perhaps,” said the Lion thoughtfully, “if I had no heart I should not\\nbe a coward.”\\n\\n“Have you brains?” asked the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“I suppose so. I’ve never looked to see,” replied the Lion.\\n\\n“I am going to the Great Oz to ask him to give me some,” remarked the\\nScarecrow, “for my head is stuffed with straw.”\\n\\n“And I am going to ask him to give me a heart,” said the Woodman.\\n\\n“And I am going to ask him to send Toto and me back to Kansas,” added\\nDorothy.\\n\\n“Do you think Oz could give me courage?” asked the Cowardly Lion.\\n\\n“Just as easily as he could give me brains,” said the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“Or give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“Or send me back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.\\n\\n“Then, if you don’t mind, I’ll go with you,” said the Lion, “for my\\nlife is simply unbearable without a bit of courage.”\\n\\n“You will be very welcome,” answered Dorothy, “for you will help to\\nkeep away the other wild beasts. It seems to me they must be more\\ncowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily.”\\n\\n“They really are,” said the Lion, “but that doesn’t make me any braver,\\nand as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy.”\\n\\nSo once more the little company set off upon the journey, the Lion\\nwalking with stately strides at Dorothy’s side. Toto did not approve of\\nthis new comrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he had\\nbeen crushed between the Lion’s great jaws. But after a time he became\\nmore at ease, and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be\\ngood friends.\\n\\nDuring the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the\\npeace of their journey. Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a\\nbeetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little\\nthing. This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always\\ncareful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept\\nseveral tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran slowly down his\\nface and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted. When\\nDorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open\\nhis mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together. He became greatly\\nfrightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, but\\nshe could not understand. The Lion was also puzzled to know what was\\nwrong. But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy’s basket and\\noiled the Woodman’s jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as\\nwell as before.\\n\\n“This will serve me a lesson,” said he, “to look where I step. For if I\\nshould kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and crying\\nrusts my jaws so that I cannot speak.”\\n\\nThereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and\\nwhen he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to\\nharm it. The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart, and therefore\\nhe took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything.\\n\\n“You people with hearts,” he said, “have something to guide you, and\\nneed never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very\\ncareful. When Oz gives me a heart of course I needn’t mind so much.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VII\\nThe Journey to the Great Oz\\n\\n\\nThey were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the\\nforest, for there were no houses near. The tree made a good, thick\\ncovering to protect them from the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a\\ngreat pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that\\nwarmed her and made her feel less lonely. She and Toto ate the last of\\ntheir bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast.\\n\\n“If you wish,” said the Lion, “I will go into the forest and kill a\\ndeer for you. You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so\\npeculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very\\ngood breakfast.”\\n\\n“Don’t! Please don’t,” begged the Tin Woodman. “I should certainly weep\\nif you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again.”\\n\\nBut the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no\\none ever knew what it was, for he didn’t mention it. And the Scarecrow\\nfound a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy’s basket with them, so\\nthat she would not be hungry for a long time. She thought this was very\\nkind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the\\nawkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts. His padded\\nhands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost\\nas many as he put in the basket. But the Scarecrow did not mind how\\nlong it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away\\nfrom the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn\\nhim up. So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came\\nnear to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep. These\\nkept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning.\\n\\nWhen it was daylight, the girl bathed her face in a little rippling\\nbrook, and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City.\\n\\nThis was to be an eventful day for the travelers. They had hardly been\\nwalking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed\\nthe road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either\\nside. It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and\\nlooked into it they could see it was also very deep, and there were\\nmany big, jagged rocks at the bottom. The sides were so steep that none\\nof them could climb down, and for a moment it seemed that their journey\\nmust end.\\n\\n“What shall we do?” asked Dorothy despairingly.\\n\\n“I haven’t the faintest idea,” said the Tin Woodman, and the Lion shook\\nhis shaggy mane and looked thoughtful.\\n\\nBut the Scarecrow said, “We cannot fly, that is certain. Neither can we\\nclimb down into this great ditch. Therefore, if we cannot jump over it,\\nwe must stop where we are.”\\n\\n“I think I could jump over it,” said the Cowardly Lion, after measuring\\nthe distance carefully in his mind.\\n\\n“Then we are all right,” answered the Scarecrow, “for you can carry us\\nall over on your back, one at a time.”\\n\\n“Well, I’ll try it,” said the Lion. “Who will go first?”\\n\\n“I will,” declared the Scarecrow, “for, if you found that you could not\\njump over the gulf, Dorothy would be killed, or the Tin Woodman badly\\ndented on the rocks below. But if I am on your back it will not matter\\nso much, for the fall would not hurt me at all.”\\n\\n“I am terribly afraid of falling, myself,” said the Cowardly Lion, “but\\nI suppose there is nothing to do but try it. So get on my back and we\\nwill make the attempt.”\\n\\nThe Scarecrow sat upon the Lion’s back, and the big beast walked to the\\nedge of the gulf and crouched down.\\n\\n“Why don’t you run and jump?” asked the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“Because that isn’t the way we Lions do these things,” he replied. Then\\ngiving a great spring, he shot through the air and landed safely on the\\nother side. They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it,\\nand after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion sprang\\nacross the ditch again.\\n\\nDorothy thought she would go next; so she took Toto in her arms and\\nclimbed on the Lion’s back, holding tightly to his mane with one hand.\\nThe next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air; and\\nthen, before she had time to think about it, she was safe on the other\\nside. The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman, and then\\nthey all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest,\\nfor his great leaps had made his breath short, and he panted like a big\\ndog that has been running too long.\\n\\nThey found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark and\\ngloomy. After the Lion had rested they started along the road of yellow\\nbrick, silently wondering, each in his own mind, if ever they would\\ncome to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again. To\\nadd to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in the depths\\nof the forest, and the Lion whispered to them that it was in this part\\nof the country that the Kalidahs lived.\\n\\n“What are the Kalidahs?” asked the girl.\\n\\n“They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like\\ntigers,” replied the Lion, “and with claws so long and sharp that they\\ncould tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto. I’m terribly\\nafraid of the Kalidahs.”\\n\\n“I’m not surprised that you are,” returned Dorothy. “They must be\\ndreadful beasts.”\\n\\nThe Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf\\nacross the road. But this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew\\nat once he could not leap across it.\\n\\nSo they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious\\nthought the Scarecrow said:\\n\\n“Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch. If the Tin Woodman\\ncan chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk\\nacross it easily.”\\n\\n“That is a first-rate idea,” said the Lion. “One would almost suspect\\nyou had brains in your head, instead of straw.”\\n\\nThe Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree\\nwas soon chopped nearly through. Then the Lion put his strong front\\nlegs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big\\ntree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top\\nbranches on the other side.\\n\\nThey had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl\\nmade them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them\\ntwo great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers.\\n\\n“They are the Kalidahs!” said the Cowardly Lion, beginning to tremble.\\n\\n“Quick!” cried the Scarecrow. “Let us cross over.”\\n\\nSo Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms, the Tin Woodman\\nfollowed, and the Scarecrow came next. The Lion, although he was\\ncertainly afraid, turned to face the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud\\nand terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over\\nbackward, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him\\nin surprise.\\n\\nBut, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there\\nwere two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed\\nforward, and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they\\nwould do next. Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began\\nto cross the tree. And the Lion said to Dorothy:\\n\\n“We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp\\nclaws. But stand close behind me, and I will fight them as long as I am\\nalive.”\\n\\n“Wait a minute!” called the Scarecrow. He had been thinking what was\\nbest to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of\\nthe tree that rested on their side of the ditch. The Tin Woodman began\\nto use his axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were nearly\\nacross, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly,\\nsnarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp\\nrocks at the bottom.\\n\\n“Well,” said the Cowardly Lion, drawing a long breath of relief, “I see\\nwe are going to live a little while longer, and I am glad of it, for it\\nmust be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive. Those creatures\\nfrightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet.”\\n\\n“Ah,” said the Tin Woodman sadly, “I wish I had a heart to beat.”\\n\\nThis adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of\\nthe forest, and they walked so fast that Dorothy became tired, and had\\nto ride on the Lion’s back. To their great joy the trees became thinner\\nthe farther they advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon\\na broad river, flowing swiftly just before them. On the other side of\\nthe water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a\\nbeautiful country, with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and\\nall the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits. They\\nwere greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them.\\n\\n“How shall we cross the river?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“That is easily done,” replied the Scarecrow. “The Tin Woodman must\\nbuild us a raft, so we can float to the other side.”\\n\\nSo the Woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make\\na raft, and while he was busy at this the Scarecrow found on the\\nriverbank a tree full of fine fruit. This pleased Dorothy, who had\\neaten nothing but nuts all day, and she made a hearty meal of the ripe\\nfruit.\\n\\nBut it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as industrious and\\nuntiring as the Tin Woodman, and when night came the work was not done.\\nSo they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until\\nthe morning; and Dorothy dreamed of the Emerald City, and of the good\\nWizard Oz, who would soon send her back to her own home again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VIII\\nThe Deadly Poppy Field\\n\\n\\nOur little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and\\nfull of hope, and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and\\nplums from the trees beside the river. Behind them was the dark forest\\nthey had passed safely through, although they had suffered many\\ndiscouragements; but before them was a lovely, sunny country that\\nseemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City.\\n\\nTo be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land.\\nBut the raft was nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few\\nmore logs and fastened them together with wooden pins, they were ready\\nto start. Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held Toto in\\nher arms. When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly,\\nfor he was big and heavy; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood\\nupon the other end to steady it, and they had long poles in their hands\\nto push the raft through the water.\\n\\nThey got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of\\nthe river the swift current swept the raft downstream, farther and\\nfarther away from the road of yellow brick. And the water grew so deep\\nthat the long poles would not touch the bottom.\\n\\n“This is bad,” said the Tin Woodman, “for if we cannot get to the land\\nwe shall be carried into the country of the Wicked Witch of the West,\\nand she will enchant us and make us her slaves.”\\n\\n“And then I should get no brains,” said the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“And I should get no courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.\\n\\n“And I should get no heart,” said the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“And I should never get back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.\\n\\n“We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can,” the Scarecrow\\ncontinued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in\\nthe mud at the bottom of the river. Then, before he could pull it out\\nagain—or let go—the raft was swept away, and the poor Scarecrow was\\nleft clinging to the pole in the middle of the river.\\n\\n“Good-bye!” he called after them, and they were very sorry to leave\\nhim. Indeed, the Tin Woodman began to cry, but fortunately remembered\\nthat he might rust, and so dried his tears on Dorothy’s apron.\\n\\nOf course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“I am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy,” he thought. “Then,\\nI was stuck on a pole in a cornfield, where I could make-believe scare\\nthe crows, at any rate. But surely there is no use for a Scarecrow\\nstuck on a pole in the middle of a river. I am afraid I shall never\\nhave any brains, after all!”\\n\\nDown the stream the raft floated, and the poor Scarecrow was left far\\nbehind. Then the Lion said:\\n\\n“Something must be done to save us. I think I can swim to the shore and\\npull the raft after me, if you will only hold fast to the tip of my\\ntail.”\\n\\nSo he sprang into the water, and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of\\nhis tail. Then the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the\\nshore. It was hard work, although he was so big; but by and by they\\nwere drawn out of the current, and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman’s\\nlong pole and helped push the raft to the land.\\n\\nThey were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped\\noff upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had\\ncarried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the\\nEmerald City.\\n\\n“What shall we do now?” asked the Tin Woodman, as the Lion lay down on\\nthe grass to let the sun dry him.\\n\\n“We must get back to the road, in some way,” said Dorothy.\\n\\n“The best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the\\nroad again,” remarked the Lion.\\n\\nSo, when they were rested, Dorothy picked up her basket and they\\nstarted along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had\\ncarried them. It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit\\ntrees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry for\\nthe poor Scarecrow, they could have been very happy.\\n\\nThey walked along as fast as they could, Dorothy only stopping once to\\npick a beautiful flower; and after a time the Tin Woodman cried out:\\n“Look!”\\n\\nThen they all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched upon\\nhis pole in the middle of the water, looking very lonely and sad.\\n\\n“What can we do to save him?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\nThe Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads, for they did not know.\\nSo they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow\\nuntil a Stork flew by, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the\\nwater’s edge.\\n\\n“Who are you and where are you going?” asked the Stork.\\n\\n“I am Dorothy,” answered the girl, “and these are my friends, the Tin\\nWoodman and the Cowardly Lion; and we are going to the Emerald City.”\\n\\n“This isn’t the road,” said the Stork, as she twisted her long neck and\\nlooked sharply at the queer party.\\n\\n“I know it,” returned Dorothy, “but we have lost the Scarecrow, and are\\nwondering how we shall get him again.”\\n\\n“Where is he?” asked the Stork.\\n\\n“Over there in the river,” answered the little girl.\\n\\n“If he wasn’t so big and heavy I would get him for you,” remarked the\\nStork.\\n\\n“He isn’t heavy a bit,” said Dorothy eagerly, “for he is stuffed with\\nstraw; and if you will bring him back to us, we shall thank you ever\\nand ever so much.”\\n\\n“Well, I’ll try,” said the Stork, “but if I find he is too heavy to\\ncarry I shall have to drop him in the river again.”\\n\\nSo the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to\\nwhere the Scarecrow was perched upon his pole. Then the Stork with her\\ngreat claws grabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into\\nthe air and back to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin\\nWoodman and Toto were sitting.\\n\\nWhen the Scarecrow found himself among his friends again, he was so\\nhappy that he hugged them all, even the Lion and Toto; and as they\\nwalked along he sang “Tol-de-ri-de-oh!” at every step, he felt so gay.\\n\\n“I was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever,” he said,\\n“but the kind Stork saved me, and if I ever get any brains I shall find\\nthe Stork again and do her some kindness in return.”\\n\\n“That’s all right,” said the Stork, who was flying along beside them.\\n“I always like to help anyone in trouble. But I must go now, for my\\nbabies are waiting in the nest for me. I hope you will find the Emerald\\nCity and that Oz will help you.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” replied Dorothy, and then the kind Stork flew into the air\\nand was soon out of sight.\\n\\nThey walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored\\nbirds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that\\nthe ground was carpeted with them. There were big yellow and white and\\nblue and purple blossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies,\\nwhich were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled Dorothy’s eyes.\\n\\n“Aren’t they beautiful?” the girl asked, as she breathed in the spicy\\nscent of the bright flowers.\\n\\n“I suppose so,” answered the Scarecrow. “When I have brains, I shall\\nprobably like them better.”\\n\\n“If I only had a heart, I should love them,” added the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“I always did like flowers,” said the Lion. “They seem so helpless and\\nfrail. But there are none in the forest so bright as these.”\\n\\nThey now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer\\nand fewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the\\nmidst of a great meadow of poppies. Now it is well known that when\\nthere are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that\\nanyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried\\naway from the scent of the flowers, he sleeps on and on forever. But\\nDorothy did not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red\\nflowers that were everywhere about; so presently her eyes grew heavy\\nand she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep.\\n\\nBut the Tin Woodman would not let her do this.\\n\\n“We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark,”\\nhe said; and the Scarecrow agreed with him. So they kept walking until\\nDorothy could stand no longer. Her eyes closed in spite of herself and\\nshe forgot where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep.\\n\\n“What shall we do?” asked the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“If we leave her here she will die,” said the Lion. “The smell of the\\nflowers is killing us all. I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open, and\\nthe dog is asleep already.”\\n\\nIt was true; Toto had fallen down beside his little mistress. But the\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman, not being made of flesh, were not\\ntroubled by the scent of the flowers.\\n\\n“Run fast,” said the Scarecrow to the Lion, “and get out of this deadly\\nflower bed as soon as you can. We will bring the little girl with us,\\nbut if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried.”\\n\\nSo the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go.\\nIn a moment he was out of sight.\\n\\n“Let us make a chair with our hands and carry her,” said the Scarecrow.\\nSo they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy’s lap, and then they\\nmade a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms\\nand carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers.\\n\\nOn and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly\\nflowers that surrounded them would never end. They followed the bend of\\nthe river, and at last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast\\nasleep among the poppies. The flowers had been too strong for the huge\\nbeast and he had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance\\nfrom the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in\\nbeautiful green fields before them.\\n\\n“We can do nothing for him,” said the Tin Woodman, sadly; “for he is\\nmuch too heavy to lift. We must leave him here to sleep on forever, and\\nperhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last.”\\n\\n“I’m sorry,” said the Scarecrow. “The Lion was a very good comrade for\\none so cowardly. But let us go on.”\\n\\nThey carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far\\nenough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the\\npoison of the flowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft grass\\nand waited for the fresh breeze to waken her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter IX\\nThe Queen of the Field Mice\\n\\n\\n“We cannot be far from the road of yellow brick, now,” remarked the\\nScarecrow, as he stood beside the girl, “for we have come nearly as far\\nas the river carried us away.”\\n\\nThe Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and\\nturning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a strange\\nbeast come bounding over the grass toward them. It was, indeed, a great\\nyellow Wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something,\\nfor its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open,\\nshowing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed like balls of\\nfire. As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the\\nbeast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no heart he\\nknew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty,\\nharmless creature.\\n\\nSo the Woodman raised his axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a\\nquick blow that cut the beast’s head clean off from its body, and it\\nrolled over at his feet in two pieces.\\n\\nThe field mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short;\\nand coming slowly up to the Woodman it said, in a squeaky little voice:\\n\\n“Oh, thank you! Thank you ever so much for saving my life.”\\n\\n“Don’t speak of it, I beg of you,” replied the Woodman. “I have no\\nheart, you know, so I am careful to help all those who may need a\\nfriend, even if it happens to be only a mouse.”\\n\\n“Only a mouse!” cried the little animal, indignantly. “Why, I am a\\nQueen—the Queen of all the Field Mice!”\\n\\n“Oh, indeed,” said the Woodman, making a bow.\\n\\n“Therefore you have done a great deed, as well as a brave one, in\\nsaving my life,” added the Queen.\\n\\nAt that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their\\nlittle legs could carry them, and when they saw their Queen they\\nexclaimed:\\n\\n“Oh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed! How did you manage\\nto escape the great Wildcat?” They all bowed so low to the little Queen\\nthat they almost stood upon their heads.\\n\\n“This funny tin man,” she answered, “killed the Wildcat and saved my\\nlife. So hereafter you must all serve him, and obey his slightest\\nwish.”\\n\\n“We will!” cried all the mice, in a shrill chorus. And then they\\nscampered in all directions, for Toto had awakened from his sleep, and\\nseeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped\\nright into the middle of the group. Toto had always loved to chase mice\\nwhen he lived in Kansas, and he saw no harm in it.\\n\\nBut the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight,\\nwhile he called to the mice, “Come back! Come back! Toto shall not hurt\\nyou.”\\n\\nAt this the Queen of the Mice stuck her head out from underneath a\\nclump of grass and asked, in a timid voice, “Are you sure he will not\\nbite us?”\\n\\n“I will not let him,” said the Woodman; “so do not be afraid.”\\n\\nOne by one the mice came creeping back, and Toto did not bark again,\\nalthough he tried to get out of the Woodman’s arms, and would have\\nbitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin. Finally one\\nof the biggest mice spoke.\\n\\n“Is there anything we can do,” it asked, “to repay you for saving the\\nlife of our Queen?”\\n\\n“Nothing that I know of,” answered the Woodman; but the Scarecrow, who\\nhad been trying to think, but could not because his head was stuffed\\nwith straw, said, quickly, “Oh, yes; you can save our friend, the\\nCowardly Lion, who is asleep in the poppy bed.”\\n\\n“A Lion!” cried the little Queen. “Why, he would eat us all up.”\\n\\n“Oh, no,” declared the Scarecrow; “this Lion is a coward.”\\n\\n“Really?” asked the Mouse.\\n\\n“He says so himself,” answered the Scarecrow, “and he would never hurt\\nanyone who is our friend. If you will help us to save him I promise\\nthat he shall treat you all with kindness.”\\n\\n“Very well,” said the Queen, “we trust you. But what shall we do?”\\n\\n“Are there many of these mice which call you Queen and are willing to\\nobey you?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes; there are thousands,” she replied.\\n\\n“Then send for them all to come here as soon as possible, and let each\\none bring a long piece of string.”\\n\\nThe Queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at\\nonce and get all her people. As soon as they heard her orders they ran\\naway in every direction as fast as possible.\\n\\n“Now,” said the Scarecrow to the Tin Woodman, “you must go to those\\ntrees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the Lion.”\\n\\nSo the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work; and he soon\\nmade a truck out of the limbs of trees, from which he chopped away all\\nthe leaves and branches. He fastened it together with wooden pegs and\\nmade the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk. So fast\\nand so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the\\ntruck was all ready for them.\\n\\nThey came from all directions, and there were thousands of them: big\\nmice and little mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a\\npiece of string in his mouth. It was about this time that Dorothy woke\\nfrom her long sleep and opened her eyes. She was greatly astonished to\\nfind herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice standing\\naround and looking at her timidly. But the Scarecrow told her about\\neverything, and turning to the dignified little Mouse, he said:\\n\\n“Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen.”\\n\\nDorothy nodded gravely and the Queen made a curtsy, after which she\\nbecame quite friendly with the little girl.\\n\\nThe Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the\\ntruck, using the strings they had brought. One end of a string was tied\\naround the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck. Of course\\nthe truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to\\ndraw it; but when all the mice had been harnessed, they were able to\\npull it quite easily. Even the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman could sit\\non it, and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place\\nwhere the Lion lay asleep.\\n\\nAfter a great deal of hard work, for the Lion was heavy, they managed\\nto get him up on the truck. Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people\\nthe order to start, for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies\\ntoo long they also would fall asleep.\\n\\nAt first the little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir\\nthe heavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed\\nfrom behind, and they got along better. Soon they rolled the Lion out\\nof the poppy bed to the green fields, where he could breathe the sweet,\\nfresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers.\\n\\nDorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving\\nher companion from death. She had grown so fond of the big Lion she was\\nglad he had been rescued.\\n\\nThen the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away\\nthrough the grass to their homes. The Queen of the Mice was the last to\\nleave.\\n\\n“If ever you need us again,” she said, “come out into the field and\\ncall, and we shall hear you and come to your assistance. Good-bye!”\\n\\n“Good-bye!” they all answered, and away the Queen ran, while Dorothy\\nheld Toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her.\\n\\nAfter this they sat down beside the Lion until he should awaken; and\\nthe Scarecrow brought Dorothy some fruit from a tree near by, which she\\nate for her dinner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter X\\nThe Guardian of the Gate\\n\\n\\nIt was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened, for he had lain\\namong the poppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance;\\nbut when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad\\nto find himself still alive.\\n\\n“I ran as fast as I could,” he said, sitting down and yawning, “but the\\nflowers were too strong for me. How did you get me out?”\\n\\nThen they told him of the field mice, and how they had generously saved\\nhim from death; and the Cowardly Lion laughed, and said:\\n\\n“I have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such little\\nthings as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as\\nmice have saved my life. How strange it all is! But, comrades, what\\nshall we do now?”\\n\\n“We must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again,” said\\nDorothy, “and then we can keep on to the Emerald City.”\\n\\nSo, the Lion being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again,\\nthey all started upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through\\nthe soft, fresh grass; and it was not long before they reached the road\\nof yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the\\nGreat Oz dwelt.\\n\\nThe road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was\\nbeautiful, so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far\\nbehind, and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades.\\nOnce more they could see fences built beside the road; but these were\\npainted green, and when they came to a small house, in which a farmer\\nevidently lived, that also was painted green. They passed by several of\\nthese houses during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the\\ndoors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no\\none came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion, of\\nwhich they were very much afraid. The people were all dressed in\\nclothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like\\nthose of the Munchkins.\\n\\n“This must be the Land of Oz,” said Dorothy, “and we are surely getting\\nnear the Emerald City.”\\n\\n“Yes,” answered the Scarecrow. “Everything is green here, while in the\\ncountry of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color. But the people do\\nnot seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins, and I’m afraid we shall be\\nunable to find a place to pass the night.”\\n\\n“I should like something to eat besides fruit,” said the girl, “and I’m\\nsure Toto is nearly starved. Let us stop at the next house and talk to\\nthe people.”\\n\\nSo, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, Dorothy walked boldly up\\nto the door and knocked.\\n\\nA woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, “What do you\\nwant, child, and why is that great Lion with you?”\\n\\n“We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us,” answered\\nDorothy; “and the Lion is my friend and comrade, and would not hurt you\\nfor the world.”\\n\\n“Is he tame?” asked the woman, opening the door a little wider.\\n\\n“Oh, yes,” said the girl, “and he is a great coward, too. He will be\\nmore afraid of you than you are of him.”\\n\\n“Well,” said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another peep\\nat the Lion, “if that is the case you may come in, and I will give you\\nsome supper and a place to sleep.”\\n\\nSo they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two\\nchildren and a man. The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the\\ncouch in a corner. They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a\\ncompany, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked:\\n\\n“Where are you all going?”\\n\\n“To the Emerald City,” said Dorothy, “to see the Great Oz.”\\n\\n“Oh, indeed!” exclaimed the man. “Are you sure that Oz will see you?”\\n\\n“Why not?” she replied.\\n\\n“Why, it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence. I\\nhave been to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and\\nwonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz,\\nnor do I know of any living person who has seen him.”\\n\\n“Does he never go out?” asked the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“Never. He sits day after day in the great Throne Room of his Palace,\\nand even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face.”\\n\\n“What is he like?” asked the girl.\\n\\n“That is hard to tell,” said the man thoughtfully. “You see, Oz is a\\nGreat Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some say he\\nlooks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say\\nhe looks like a cat. To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a\\nbrownie, or in any other form that pleases him. But who the real Oz is,\\nwhen he is in his own form, no living person can tell.”\\n\\n“That is very strange,” said Dorothy, “but we must try, in some way, to\\nsee him, or we shall have made our journey for nothing.”\\n\\n“Why do you wish to see the terrible Oz?” asked the man.\\n\\n“I want him to give me some brains,” said the Scarecrow eagerly.\\n\\n“Oh, Oz could do that easily enough,” declared the man. “He has more\\nbrains than he needs.”\\n\\n“And I want him to give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“That will not trouble him,” continued the man, “for Oz has a large\\ncollection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes.”\\n\\n“And I want him to give me courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.\\n\\n“Oz keeps a great pot of courage in his Throne Room,” said the man,\\n“which he has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running\\nover. He will be glad to give you some.”\\n\\n“And I want him to send me back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.\\n\\n“Where is Kansas?” asked the man, with surprise.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” replied Dorothy sorrowfully, “but it is my home, and\\nI’m sure it’s somewhere.”\\n\\n“Very likely. Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find\\nKansas for you. But first you must get to see him, and that will be a\\nhard task; for the Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he\\nusually has his own way. But what do YOU want?” he continued, speaking\\nto Toto. Toto only wagged his tail; for, strange to say, he could not\\nspeak.\\n\\nThe woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered\\naround the table and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of\\nscrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her meal.\\nThe Lion ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it\\nwas made from oats and oats were food for horses, not for lions. The\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing at all. Toto ate a little of\\neverything, and was glad to get a good supper again.\\n\\nThe woman now gave Dorothy a bed to sleep in, and Toto lay down beside\\nher, while the Lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be\\ndisturbed. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood up in a corner and\\nkept quiet all night, although of course they could not sleep.\\n\\nThe next morning, as soon as the sun was up, they started on their way,\\nand soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them.\\n\\n“That must be the Emerald City,” said Dorothy.\\n\\nAs they walked on, the green glow became brighter and brighter, and it\\nseemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels. Yet it\\nwas afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the\\nCity. It was high and thick and of a bright green color.\\n\\nIn front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big\\ngate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even\\nthe painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy.\\n\\nThere was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the button and\\nheard a silvery tinkle sound within. Then the big gate swung slowly\\nopen, and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched\\nroom, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds.\\n\\nBefore them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins. He\\nwas clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his skin\\nwas of a greenish tint. At his side was a large green box.\\n\\nWhen he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked, “What do you wish\\nin the Emerald City?”\\n\\n“We came here to see the Great Oz,” said Dorothy.\\n\\nThe man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it\\nover.\\n\\n“It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz,” he said,\\nshaking his head in perplexity. “He is powerful and terrible, and if\\nyou come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of\\nthe Great Wizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant.”\\n\\n“But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one,” replied the\\nScarecrow; “it is important. And we have been told that Oz is a good\\nWizard.”\\n\\n“So he is,” said the green man, “and he rules the Emerald City wisely\\nand well. But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from\\ncuriosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his\\nface. I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the\\nGreat Oz I must take you to his Palace. But first you must put on the\\nspectacles.”\\n\\n“Why?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the\\nEmerald City would blind you. Even those who live in the City must wear\\nspectacles night and day. They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it\\nwhen the City was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock\\nthem.”\\n\\nHe opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with\\nspectacles of every size and shape. All of them had green glasses in\\nthem. The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit\\nDorothy and put them over her eyes. There were two golden bands\\nfastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they\\nwere locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the\\nGuardian of the Gates wore around his neck. When they were on, Dorothy\\ncould not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish\\nto be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.\\n\\nThen the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin\\nWoodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast\\nwith the key.\\n\\nThen the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he\\nwas ready to show them to the Palace. Taking a big golden key from a\\npeg on the wall, he opened another gate, and they all followed him\\nthrough the portal into the streets of the Emerald City.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XI\\nThe Wonderful City of Oz\\n\\n\\nEven with eyes protected by the green spectacles, Dorothy and her\\nfriends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City.\\nThe streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble\\nand studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds. They walked over a\\npavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks were joined\\ntogether were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the\\nbrightness of the sun. The window panes were of green glass; even the\\nsky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sun were\\ngreen.\\n\\nThere were many people—men, women, and children—walking about, and\\nthese were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins. They\\nlooked at Dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering\\neyes, and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when\\nthey saw the Lion; but no one spoke to them. Many shops stood in the\\nstreet, and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green. Green candy\\nand green pop-corn were offered for sale, as well as green shoes, green\\nhats, and green clothes of all sorts. At one place a man was selling\\ngreen lemonade, and when the children bought it Dorothy could see that\\nthey paid for it with green pennies.\\n\\nThere seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind; the men carried\\nthings around in little green carts, which they pushed before them.\\nEveryone seemed happy and contented and prosperous.\\n\\nThe Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they came\\nto a big building, exactly in the middle of the City, which was the\\nPalace of Oz, the Great Wizard. There was a soldier before the door,\\ndressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard.\\n\\n“Here are strangers,” said the Guardian of the Gates to him, “and they\\ndemand to see the Great Oz.”\\n\\n“Step inside,” answered the soldier, “and I will carry your message to\\nhim.”\\n\\nSo they passed through the Palace Gates and were led into a big room\\nwith a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds. The\\nsoldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering\\nthis room, and when they were seated he said politely:\\n\\n“Please make yourselves comfortable while I go to the door of the\\nThrone Room and tell Oz you are here.”\\n\\nThey had to wait a long time before the soldier returned. When, at\\nlast, he came back, Dorothy asked:\\n\\n“Have you seen Oz?”\\n\\n“Oh, no,” returned the soldier; “I have never seen him. But I spoke to\\nhim as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message. He said he\\nwill grant you an audience, if you so desire; but each one of you must\\nenter his presence alone, and he will admit but one each day.\\nTherefore, as you must remain in the Palace for several days, I will\\nhave you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your\\njourney.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” replied the girl; “that is very kind of Oz.”\\n\\nThe soldier now blew upon a green whistle, and at once a young girl,\\ndressed in a pretty green silk gown, entered the room. She had lovely\\ngreen hair and green eyes, and she bowed low before Dorothy as she\\nsaid, “Follow me and I will show you your room.”\\n\\nSo Dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except Toto, and taking the\\ndog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up\\nthree flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the\\nPalace. It was the sweetest little room in the world, with a soft\\ncomfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet\\ncounterpane. There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room, that\\nshot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back into a\\nbeautifully carved green marble basin. Beautiful green flowers stood in\\nthe windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books.\\nWhen Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer\\ngreen pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny.\\n\\nIn a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and\\nvelvet; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly.\\n\\n“Make yourself perfectly at home,” said the green girl, “and if you\\nwish for anything ring the bell. Oz will send for you tomorrow\\nmorning.”\\n\\nShe left Dorothy alone and went back to the others. These she also led\\nto rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant\\npart of the Palace. Of course this politeness was wasted on the\\nScarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood\\nstupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning. It\\nwould not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so he\\nremained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web\\nin a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most\\nwonderful rooms in the world. The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from\\nforce of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not\\nbeing able to sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down\\nto make sure they kept in good working order. The Lion would have\\npreferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being\\nshut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry him, so\\nhe sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred\\nhimself asleep in a minute.\\n\\nThe next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch\\nDorothy, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of\\ngreen brocaded satin. Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a\\ngreen ribbon around Toto’s neck, and they started for the Throne Room\\nof the Great Oz.\\n\\nFirst they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen\\nof the court, all dressed in rich costumes. These people had nothing to\\ndo but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the\\nThrone Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see\\nOz. As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously, and one of them\\nwhispered:\\n\\n“Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?”\\n\\n“Of course,” answered the girl, “if he will see me.”\\n\\n“Oh, he will see you,” said the soldier who had taken her message to\\nthe Wizard, “although he does not like to have people ask to see him.\\nIndeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you\\ncame from. Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned\\nyour silver shoes he was very much interested. At last I told him about\\nthe mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to his\\npresence.”\\n\\nJust then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, “That is the\\nsignal. You must go into the Throne Room alone.”\\n\\nShe opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found\\nherself in a wonderful place. It was a big, round room with a high\\narched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with\\nlarge emeralds set closely together. In the center of the roof was a\\ngreat light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a\\nwonderful manner.\\n\\nBut what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble\\nthat stood in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair and\\nsparkled with gems, as did everything else. In the center of the chair\\nwas an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs\\nwhatever. There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose\\nand mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant.\\n\\nAs Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly\\nand looked at her sharply and steadily. Then the mouth moved, and\\nDorothy heard a voice say:\\n\\n“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?”\\n\\nIt was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big\\nHead; so she took courage and answered:\\n\\n“I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek. I have come to you for help.”\\n\\nThe eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute. Then said the\\nvoice:\\n\\n“Where did you get the silver shoes?”\\n\\n“I got them from the Wicked Witch of the East, when my house fell on\\nher and killed her,” she replied.\\n\\n“Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?” continued the voice.\\n\\n“That is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me\\ngood-bye and sent me to you,” said the girl.\\n\\nAgain the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the\\ntruth. Then Oz asked, “What do you wish me to do?”\\n\\n“Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,” she\\nanswered earnestly. “I don’t like your country, although it is so\\nbeautiful. And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my\\nbeing away so long.”\\n\\nThe eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and\\ndown to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see\\nevery part of the room. And at last they looked at Dorothy again.\\n\\n“Why should I do this for you?” asked Oz.\\n\\n“Because you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard\\nand I am only a little girl.”\\n\\n“But you were strong enough to kill the Wicked Witch of the East,” said\\nOz.\\n\\n“That just happened,” returned Dorothy simply; “I could not help it.”\\n\\n“Well,” said the Head, “I will give you my answer. You have no right to\\nexpect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me in\\nreturn. In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets. If\\nyou wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do\\nsomething for me first. Help me and I will help you.”\\n\\n“What must I do?” asked the girl.\\n\\n“Kill the Wicked Witch of the West,” answered Oz.\\n\\n“But I cannot!” exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised.\\n\\n“You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes, which\\nbear a powerful charm. There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all\\nthis land, and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to\\nKansas—but not before.”\\n\\nThe little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the\\neyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Oz\\nfelt that she could help him if she would.\\n\\n“I never killed anything, willingly,” she sobbed. “Even if I wanted to,\\nhow could I kill the Wicked Witch? If you, who are Great and Terrible,\\ncannot kill her yourself, how do you expect me to do it?”\\n\\n“I do not know,” said the Head; “but that is my answer, and until the\\nWicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again. Remember\\nthat the Witch is Wicked—tremendously Wicked—and ought to be killed.\\nNow go, and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task.”\\n\\nSorrowfully Dorothy left the Throne Room and went back where the Lion\\nand the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were waiting to hear what Oz had\\nsaid to her. “There is no hope for me,” she said sadly, “for Oz will\\nnot send me home until I have killed the Wicked Witch of the West; and\\nthat I can never do.”\\n\\nHer friends were sorry, but could do nothing to help her; so Dorothy\\nwent to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to\\nsleep.\\n\\nThe next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the\\nScarecrow and said:\\n\\n“Come with me, for Oz has sent for you.”\\n\\nSo the Scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great Throne\\nRoom, where he saw, sitting in the emerald throne, a most lovely Lady.\\nShe was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green\\nlocks a crown of jewels. Growing from her shoulders were wings,\\ngorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest\\nbreath of air reached them.\\n\\nWhen the Scarecrow had bowed, as prettily as his straw stuffing would\\nlet him, before this beautiful creature, she looked upon him sweetly,\\nand said:\\n\\n“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?”\\n\\nNow the Scarecrow, who had expected to see the great Head Dorothy had\\ntold him of, was much astonished; but he answered her bravely.\\n\\n“I am only a Scarecrow, stuffed with straw. Therefore I have no brains,\\nand I come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead\\nof straw, so that I may become as much a man as any other in your\\ndominions.”\\n\\n“Why should I do this for you?” asked the Lady.\\n\\n“Because you are wise and powerful, and no one else can help me,”\\nanswered the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“I never grant favors without some return,” said Oz; “but this much I\\nwill promise. If you will kill for me the Wicked Witch of the West, I\\nwill bestow upon you a great many brains, and such good brains that you\\nwill be the wisest man in all the Land of Oz.”\\n\\n“I thought you asked Dorothy to kill the Witch,” said the Scarecrow, in\\nsurprise.\\n\\n“So I did. I don’t care who kills her. But until she is dead I will not\\ngrant your wish. Now go, and do not seek me again until you have earned\\nthe brains you so greatly desire.”\\n\\nThe Scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what\\nOz had said; and Dorothy was surprised to find that the Great Wizard\\nwas not a Head, as she had seen him, but a lovely Lady.\\n\\n“All the same,” said the Scarecrow, “she needs a heart as much as the\\nTin Woodman.”\\n\\nOn the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Tin\\nWoodman and said:\\n\\n“Oz has sent for you. Follow me.”\\n\\nSo the Tin Woodman followed him and came to the great Throne Room. He\\ndid not know whether he would find Oz a lovely Lady or a Head, but he\\nhoped it would be the lovely Lady. “For,” he said to himself, “if it is\\nthe head, I am sure I shall not be given a heart, since a head has no\\nheart of its own and therefore cannot feel for me. But if it is the\\nlovely Lady I shall beg hard for a heart, for all ladies are themselves\\nsaid to be kindly hearted.”\\n\\nBut when the Woodman entered the great Throne Room he saw neither the\\nHead nor the Lady, for Oz had taken the shape of a most terrible Beast.\\nIt was nearly as big as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly\\nstrong enough to hold its weight. The Beast had a head like that of a\\nrhinoceros, only there were five eyes in its face. There were five long\\narms growing out of its body, and it also had five long, slim legs.\\nThick, woolly hair covered every part of it, and a more\\ndreadful-looking monster could not be imagined. It was fortunate the\\nTin Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would have beat loud\\nand fast from terror. But being only tin, the Woodman was not at all\\nafraid, although he was much disappointed.\\n\\n“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,” spoke the Beast, in a voice that was\\none great roar. “Who are you, and why do you seek me?”\\n\\n“I am a Woodman, and made of tin. Therefore I have no heart, and cannot\\nlove. I pray you to give me a heart that I may be as other men are.”\\n\\n“Why should I do this?” demanded the Beast.\\n\\n“Because I ask it, and you alone can grant my request,” answered the\\nWoodman.\\n\\nOz gave a low growl at this, but said, gruffly: “If you indeed desire a\\nheart, you must earn it.”\\n\\n“How?” asked the Woodman.\\n\\n“Help Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West,” replied the Beast.\\n“When the Witch is dead, come to me, and I will then give you the\\nbiggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the Land of Oz.”\\n\\nSo the Tin Woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and\\ntell them of the terrible Beast he had seen. They all wondered greatly\\nat the many forms the Great Wizard could take upon himself, and the\\nLion said:\\n\\n“If he is a Beast when I go to see him, I shall roar my loudest, and so\\nfrighten him that he will grant all I ask. And if he is the lovely\\nLady, I shall pretend to spring upon her, and so compel her to do my\\nbidding. And if he is the great Head, he will be at my mercy; for I\\nwill roll this head all about the room until he promises to give us\\nwhat we desire. So be of good cheer, my friends, for all will yet be\\nwell.”\\n\\nThe next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the Lion to\\nthe great Throne Room and bade him enter the presence of Oz.\\n\\nThe Lion at once passed through the door, and glancing around saw, to\\nhis surprise, that before the throne was a Ball of Fire, so fierce and\\nglowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it. His first thought was\\nthat Oz had by accident caught on fire and was burning up; but when he\\ntried to go nearer, the heat was so intense that it singed his\\nwhiskers, and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door.\\n\\nThen a low, quiet voice came from the Ball of Fire, and these were the\\nwords it spoke:\\n\\n“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?”\\n\\nAnd the Lion answered, “I am a Cowardly Lion, afraid of everything. I\\ncame to you to beg that you give me courage, so that in reality I may\\nbecome the King of Beasts, as men call me.”\\n\\n“Why should I give you courage?” demanded Oz.\\n\\n“Because of all Wizards you are the greatest, and alone have power to\\ngrant my request,” answered the Lion.\\n\\nThe Ball of Fire burned fiercely for a time, and the voice said, “Bring\\nme proof that the Wicked Witch is dead, and that moment I will give you\\ncourage. But as long as the Witch lives, you must remain a coward.”\\n\\nThe Lion was angry at this speech, but could say nothing in reply, and\\nwhile he stood silently gazing at the Ball of Fire it became so\\nfuriously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room. He was glad\\nto find his friends waiting for him, and told them of his terrible\\ninterview with the Wizard.\\n\\n“What shall we do now?” asked Dorothy sadly.\\n\\n“There is only one thing we can do,” returned the Lion, “and that is to\\ngo to the land of the Winkies, seek out the Wicked Witch, and destroy\\nher.”\\n\\n“But suppose we cannot?” said the girl.\\n\\n“Then I shall never have courage,” declared the Lion.\\n\\n“And I shall never have brains,” added the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“And I shall never have a heart,” spoke the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“And I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry,” said Dorothy,\\nbeginning to cry.\\n\\n“Be careful!” cried the green girl. “The tears will fall on your green\\nsilk gown and spot it.”\\n\\nSo Dorothy dried her eyes and said, “I suppose we must try it; but I am\\nsure I do not want to kill anybody, even to see Aunt Em again.”\\n\\n“I will go with you; but I’m too much of a coward to kill the Witch,”\\nsaid the Lion.\\n\\n“I will go too,” declared the Scarecrow; “but I shall not be of much\\nhelp to you, I am such a fool.”\\n\\n“I haven’t the heart to harm even a Witch,” remarked the Tin Woodman;\\n“but if you go I certainly shall go with you.”\\n\\nTherefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning,\\nand the Woodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his\\njoints properly oiled. The Scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw\\nand Dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better. The\\ngreen girl, who was very kind to them, filled Dorothy’s basket with\\ngood things to eat, and fastened a little bell around Toto’s neck with\\na green ribbon.\\n\\nThey went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight, when\\nthey were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the\\nback yard of the Palace, and the cackling of a hen that had laid a\\ngreen egg.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XII\\nThe Search for the Wicked Witch\\n\\n\\nThe soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the\\nEmerald City until they reached the room where the Guardian of the\\nGates lived. This officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in\\nhis great box, and then he politely opened the gate for our friends.\\n\\n“Which road leads to the Wicked Witch of the West?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“There is no road,” answered the Guardian of the Gates. “No one ever\\nwishes to go that way.”\\n\\n“How, then, are we to find her?” inquired the girl.\\n\\n“That will be easy,” replied the man, “for when she knows you are in\\nthe country of the Winkies she will find you, and make you all her\\nslaves.”\\n\\n“Perhaps not,” said the Scarecrow, “for we mean to destroy her.”\\n\\n“Oh, that is different,” said the Guardian of the Gates. “No one has\\never destroyed her before, so I naturally thought she would make slaves\\nof you, as she has of the rest. But take care; for she is wicked and\\nfierce, and may not allow you to destroy her. Keep to the West, where\\nthe sun sets, and you cannot fail to find her.”\\n\\nThey thanked him and bade him good-bye, and turned toward the West,\\nwalking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies\\nand buttercups. Dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on\\nin the palace, but now, to her surprise, she found it was no longer\\ngreen, but pure white. The ribbon around Toto’s neck had also lost its\\ngreen color and was as white as Dorothy’s dress.\\n\\nThe Emerald City was soon left far behind. As they advanced the ground\\nbecame rougher and hillier, for there were no farms nor houses in this\\ncountry of the West, and the ground was untilled.\\n\\nIn the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces, for there were no\\ntrees to offer them shade; so that before night Dorothy and Toto and\\nthe Lion were tired, and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep, with\\nthe Woodman and the Scarecrow keeping watch.\\n\\nNow the Wicked Witch of the West had but one eye, yet that was as\\npowerful as a telescope, and could see everywhere. So, as she sat in\\nthe door of her castle, she happened to look around and saw Dorothy\\nlying asleep, with her friends all about her. They were a long distance\\noff, but the Wicked Witch was angry to find them in her country; so she\\nblew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck.\\n\\nAt once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great\\nwolves. They had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth.\\n\\n“Go to those people,” said the Witch, “and tear them to pieces.”\\n\\n“Are you not going to make them your slaves?” asked the leader of the\\nwolves.\\n\\n“No,” she answered, “one is of tin, and one of straw; one is a girl and\\nanother a Lion. None of them is fit to work, so you may tear them into\\nsmall pieces.”\\n\\n“Very well,” said the wolf, and he dashed away at full speed, followed\\nby the others.\\n\\nIt was lucky the Scarecrow and the Woodman were wide awake and heard\\nthe wolves coming.\\n\\n“This is my fight,” said the Woodman, “so get behind me and I will meet\\nthem as they come.”\\n\\nHe seized his axe, which he had made very sharp, and as the leader of\\nthe wolves came on the Tin Woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf’s\\nhead from its body, so that it immediately died. As soon as he could\\nraise his axe another wolf came up, and he also fell under the sharp\\nedge of the Tin Woodman’s weapon. There were forty wolves, and forty\\ntimes a wolf was killed, so that at last they all lay dead in a heap\\nbefore the Woodman.\\n\\nThen he put down his axe and sat beside the Scarecrow, who said, “It\\nwas a good fight, friend.”\\n\\nThey waited until Dorothy awoke the next morning. The little girl was\\nquite frightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves, but the\\nTin Woodman told her all. She thanked him for saving them and sat down\\nto breakfast, after which they started again upon their journey.\\n\\nNow this same morning the Wicked Witch came to the door of her castle\\nand looked out with her one eye that could see far off. She saw all her\\nwolves lying dead, and the strangers still traveling through her\\ncountry. This made her angrier than before, and she blew her silver\\nwhistle twice.\\n\\nStraightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her, enough\\nto darken the sky.\\n\\nAnd the Wicked Witch said to the King Crow, “Fly at once to the\\nstrangers; peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces.”\\n\\nThe wild crows flew in one great flock toward Dorothy and her\\ncompanions. When the little girl saw them coming she was afraid.\\n\\nBut the Scarecrow said, “This is my battle, so lie down beside me and\\nyou will not be harmed.”\\n\\nSo they all lay upon the ground except the Scarecrow, and he stood up\\nand stretched out his arms. And when the crows saw him they were\\nfrightened, as these birds always are by scarecrows, and did not dare\\nto come any nearer. But the King Crow said:\\n\\n“It is only a stuffed man. I will peck his eyes out.”\\n\\nThe King Crow flew at the Scarecrow, who caught it by the head and\\ntwisted its neck until it died. And then another crow flew at him, and\\nthe Scarecrow twisted its neck also. There were forty crows, and forty\\ntimes the Scarecrow twisted a neck, until at last all were lying dead\\nbeside him. Then he called to his companions to rise, and again they\\nwent upon their journey.\\n\\nWhen the Wicked Witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a\\nheap, she got into a terrible rage, and blew three times upon her\\nsilver whistle.\\n\\nForthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air, and a swarm of\\nblack bees came flying toward her.\\n\\n“Go to the strangers and sting them to death!” commanded the Witch, and\\nthe bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where Dorothy and\\nher friends were walking. But the Woodman had seen them coming, and the\\nScarecrow had decided what to do.\\n\\n“Take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and\\nthe Lion,” he said to the Woodman, “and the bees cannot sting them.”\\nThis the Woodman did, and as Dorothy lay close beside the Lion and held\\nToto in her arms, the straw covered them entirely.\\n\\nThe bees came and found no one but the Woodman to sting, so they flew\\nat him and broke off all their stings against the tin, without hurting\\nthe Woodman at all. And as bees cannot live when their stings are\\nbroken that was the end of the black bees, and they lay scattered thick\\nabout the Woodman, like little heaps of fine coal.\\n\\nThen Dorothy and the Lion got up, and the girl helped the Tin Woodman\\nput the straw back into the Scarecrow again, until he was as good as\\never. So they started upon their journey once more.\\n\\nThe Wicked Witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little\\nheaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and\\ngnashed her teeth. And then she called a dozen of her slaves, who were\\nthe Winkies, and gave them sharp spears, telling them to go to the\\nstrangers and destroy them.\\n\\nThe Winkies were not a brave people, but they had to do as they were\\ntold. So they marched away until they came near to Dorothy. Then the\\nLion gave a great roar and sprang towards them, and the poor Winkies\\nwere so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could.\\n\\nWhen they returned to the castle the Wicked Witch beat them well with a\\nstrap, and sent them back to their work, after which she sat down to\\nthink what she should do next. She could not understand how all her\\nplans to destroy these strangers had failed; but she was a powerful\\nWitch, as well as a wicked one, and she soon made up her mind how to\\nact.\\n\\nThere was, in her cupboard, a Golden Cap, with a circle of diamonds and\\nrubies running round it. This Golden Cap had a charm. Whoever owned it\\ncould call three times upon the Winged Monkeys, who would obey any\\norder they were given. But no person could command these strange\\ncreatures more than three times. Twice already the Wicked Witch had\\nused the charm of the Cap. Once was when she had made the Winkies her\\nslaves, and set herself to rule over their country. The Winged Monkeys\\nhad helped her do this. The second time was when she had fought against\\nthe Great Oz himself, and driven him out of the land of the West. The\\nWinged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this. Only once more could\\nshe use this Golden Cap, for which reason she did not like to do so\\nuntil all her other powers were exhausted. But now that her fierce\\nwolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone, and her\\nslaves had been scared away by the Cowardly Lion, she saw there was\\nonly one way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends.\\n\\nSo the Wicked Witch took the Golden Cap from her cupboard and placed it\\nupon her head. Then she stood upon her left foot and said, slowly:\\n\\n“Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!”\\n\\nNext she stood upon her right foot and said:\\n\\n“Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!”\\n\\nAfter this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice:\\n\\n“Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!”\\n\\nNow the charm began to work. The sky was darkened, and a low rumbling\\nsound was heard in the air. There was a rushing of many wings, a great\\nchattering and laughing, and the sun came out of the dark sky to show\\nthe Wicked Witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys, each with a pair of\\nimmense and powerful wings on his shoulders.\\n\\nOne, much bigger than the others, seemed to be their leader. He flew\\nclose to the Witch and said, “You have called us for the third and last\\ntime. What do you command?”\\n\\n“Go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except\\nthe Lion,” said the Wicked Witch. “Bring that beast to me, for I have a\\nmind to harness him like a horse, and make him work.”\\n\\n“Your commands shall be obeyed,” said the leader. Then, with a great\\ndeal of chattering and noise, the Winged Monkeys flew away to the place\\nwhere Dorothy and her friends were walking.\\n\\nSome of the Monkeys seized the Tin Woodman and carried him through the\\nair until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks.\\nHere they dropped the poor Woodman, who fell a great distance to the\\nrocks, where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move\\nnor groan.\\n\\nOthers of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow, and with their long fingers\\npulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head. They made his hat\\nand boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top\\nbranches of a tall tree.\\n\\nThe remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the Lion and\\nwound many coils about his body and head and legs, until he was unable\\nto bite or scratch or struggle in any way. Then they lifted him up and\\nflew away with him to the Witch’s castle, where he was placed in a\\nsmall yard with a high iron fence around it, so that he could not\\nescape.\\n\\nBut Dorothy they did not harm at all. She stood, with Toto in her arms,\\nwatching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her\\nturn. The leader of the Winged Monkeys flew up to her, his long, hairy\\narms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly; but he saw the\\nmark of the Good Witch’s kiss upon her forehead and stopped short,\\nmotioning the others not to touch her.\\n\\n“We dare not harm this little girl,” he said to them, “for she is\\nprotected by the Power of Good, and that is greater than the Power of\\nEvil. All we can do is to carry her to the castle of the Wicked Witch\\nand leave her there.”\\n\\nSo, carefully and gently, they lifted Dorothy in their arms and carried\\nher swiftly through the air until they came to the castle, where they\\nset her down upon the front doorstep. Then the leader said to the\\nWitch:\\n\\n“We have obeyed you as far as we were able. The Tin Woodman and the\\nScarecrow are destroyed, and the Lion is tied up in your yard. The\\nlittle girl we dare not harm, nor the dog she carries in her arms. Your\\npower over our band is now ended, and you will never see us again.”\\n\\nThen all the Winged Monkeys, with much laughing and chattering and\\nnoise, flew into the air and were soon out of sight.\\n\\nThe Wicked Witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark\\non Dorothy’s forehead, for she knew well that neither the Winged\\nMonkeys nor she, herself, dare hurt the girl in any way. She looked\\ndown at Dorothy’s feet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to tremble\\nwith fear, for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them. At\\nfirst the Witch was tempted to run away from Dorothy; but she happened\\nto look into the child’s eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them\\nwas, and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the\\nSilver Shoes gave her. So the Wicked Witch laughed to herself, and\\nthought, “I can still make her my slave, for she does not know how to\\nuse her power.” Then she said to Dorothy, harshly and severely:\\n\\n“Come with me; and see that you mind everything I tell you, for if you\\ndo not I will make an end of you, as I did of the Tin Woodman and the\\nScarecrow.”\\n\\nDorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle\\nuntil they came to the kitchen, where the Witch bade her clean the pots\\nand kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.\\n\\nDorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made up to work as hard as\\nshe could; for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill\\nher.\\n\\nWith Dorothy hard at work, the Witch thought she would go into the\\ncourtyard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse; it would amuse\\nher, she was sure, to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to\\ngo to drive. But as she opened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and\\nbounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was afraid, and ran out and\\nshut the gate again.\\n\\n“If I cannot harness you,” said the Witch to the Lion, speaking through\\nthe bars of the gate, “I can starve you. You shall have nothing to eat\\nuntil you do as I wish.”\\n\\nSo after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion; but every day\\nshe came to the gate at noon and asked, “Are you ready to be harnessed\\nlike a horse?”\\n\\nAnd the Lion would answer, “No. If you come in this yard, I will bite\\nyou.”\\n\\nThe reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that\\nevery night, while the woman was asleep, Dorothy carried him food from\\nthe cupboard. After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw,\\nand Dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft, shaggy\\nmane, while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to\\nescape. But they could find no way to get out of the castle, for it was\\nconstantly guarded by the yellow Winkies, who were the slaves of the\\nWicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them.\\n\\nThe girl had to work hard during the day, and often the Witch\\nthreatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in\\nher hand. But, in truth, she did not dare to strike Dorothy, because of\\nthe mark upon her forehead. The child did not know this, and was full\\nof fear for herself and Toto. Once the Witch struck Toto a blow with\\nher umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg in\\nreturn. The Witch did not bleed where she was bitten, for she was so\\nwicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before.\\n\\nDorothy’s life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would\\nbe harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again. Sometimes\\nshe would cry bitterly for hours, with Toto sitting at her feet and\\nlooking into her face, whining dismally to show how sorry he was for\\nhis little mistress. Toto did not really care whether he was in Kansas\\nor the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was with him; but he knew the\\nlittle girl was unhappy, and that made him unhappy too.\\n\\nNow the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have for her own the Silver\\nShoes which the girl always wore. Her bees and her crows and her wolves\\nwere lying in heaps and drying up, and she had used up all the power of\\nthe Golden Cap; but if she could only get hold of the Silver Shoes,\\nthey would give her more power than all the other things she had lost.\\nShe watched Dorothy carefully, to see if she ever took off her shoes,\\nthinking she might steal them. But the child was so proud of her pretty\\nshoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took\\nher bath. The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in\\nDorothy’s room at night to take the shoes, and her dread of water was\\ngreater than her fear of the dark, so she never came near when Dorothy\\nwas bathing. Indeed, the old Witch never touched water, nor ever let\\nwater touch her in any way.\\n\\nBut the wicked creature was very cunning, and she finally thought of a\\ntrick that would give her what she wanted. She placed a bar of iron in\\nthe middle of the kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the\\niron invisible to human eyes. So that when Dorothy walked across the\\nfloor she stumbled over the bar, not being able to see it, and fell at\\nfull length. She was not much hurt, but in her fall one of the Silver\\nShoes came off; and before she could reach it, the Witch had snatched\\nit away and put it on her own skinny foot.\\n\\nThe wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick, for\\nas long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their\\ncharm, and Dorothy could not use it against her, even had she known how\\nto do so.\\n\\nThe little girl, seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes, grew\\nangry, and said to the Witch, “Give me back my shoe!”\\n\\n“I will not,” retorted the Witch, “for it is now my shoe, and not\\nyours.”\\n\\n“You are a wicked creature!” cried Dorothy. “You have no right to take\\nmy shoe from me.”\\n\\n“I shall keep it, just the same,” said the Witch, laughing at her, “and\\nsomeday I shall get the other one from you, too.”\\n\\nThis made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water\\nthat stood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her from head to\\nfoot.\\n\\nInstantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as\\nDorothy looked at her in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall\\naway.\\n\\n“See what you have done!” she screamed. “In a minute I shall melt\\naway.”\\n\\n“I’m very sorry, indeed,” said Dorothy, who was truly frightened to see\\nthe Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes.\\n\\n“Didn’t you know water would be the end of me?” asked the Witch, in a\\nwailing, despairing voice.\\n\\n“Of course not,” answered Dorothy. “How should I?”\\n\\n“Well, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you will have the\\ncastle to yourself. I have been wicked in my day, but I never thought a\\nlittle girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked\\ndeeds. Look out—here I go!”\\n\\nWith these words the Witch fell down in a brown, melted, shapeless mass\\nand began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor. Seeing\\nthat she had really melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket\\nof water and threw it over the mess. She then swept it all out the\\ndoor. After picking out the silver shoe, which was all that was left of\\nthe old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on her\\nfoot again. Then, being at last free to do as she chose, she ran out to\\nthe courtyard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West had\\ncome to an end, and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange\\nland.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XIII\\nThe Rescue\\n\\n\\nThe Cowardly Lion was much pleased to hear that the Wicked Witch had\\nbeen melted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy at once unlocked the gate\\nof his prison and set him free. They went in together to the castle,\\nwhere Dorothy’s first act was to call all the Winkies together and tell\\nthem that they were no longer slaves.\\n\\nThere was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies, for they had been\\nmade to work hard during many years for the Wicked Witch, who had\\nalways treated them with great cruelty. They kept this day as a\\nholiday, then and ever after, and spent the time in feasting and\\ndancing.\\n\\n“If our friends, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, were only with us,”\\nsaid the Lion, “I should be quite happy.”\\n\\n“Don’t you suppose we could rescue them?” asked the girl anxiously.\\n\\n“We can try,” answered the Lion.\\n\\nSo they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help to\\nrescue their friends, and the Winkies said that they would be delighted\\nto do all in their power for Dorothy, who had set them free from\\nbondage. So she chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if they\\nknew the most, and they all started away. They traveled that day and\\npart of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the Tin\\nWoodman lay, all battered and bent. His axe was near him, but the blade\\nwas rusted and the handle broken off short.\\n\\nThe Winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms, and carried him back to\\nthe Yellow Castle again, Dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the\\nsad plight of her old friend, and the Lion looking sober and sorry.\\nWhen they reached the castle Dorothy said to the Winkies:\\n\\n“Are any of your people tinsmiths?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes. Some of us are very good tinsmiths,” they told her.\\n\\n“Then bring them to me,” she said. And when the tinsmiths came,\\nbringing with them all their tools in baskets, she inquired, “Can you\\nstraighten out those dents in the Tin Woodman, and bend him back into\\nshape again, and solder him together where he is broken?”\\n\\nThe tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered that\\nthey thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever. So\\nthey set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and\\nworked for three days and four nights, hammering and twisting and\\nbending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body\\nand head of the Tin Woodman, until at last he was straightened out into\\nhis old form, and his joints worked as well as ever. To be sure, there\\nwere several patches on him, but the tinsmiths did a good job, and as\\nthe Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all.\\n\\nWhen, at last, he walked into Dorothy’s room and thanked her for\\nrescuing him, he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy, and Dorothy\\nhad to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron, so his\\njoints would not be rusted. At the same time her own tears fell thick\\nand fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again, and these tears\\ndid not need to be wiped away. As for the Lion, he wiped his eyes so\\noften with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet, and he was\\nobliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it\\ndried.\\n\\n“If we only had the Scarecrow with us again,” said the Tin Woodman,\\nwhen Dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened, “I\\nshould be quite happy.”\\n\\n“We must try to find him,” said the girl.\\n\\nSo she called the Winkies to help her, and they walked all that day and\\npart of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of\\nwhich the Winged Monkeys had tossed the Scarecrow’s clothes.\\n\\nIt was a very tall tree, and the trunk was so smooth that no one could\\nclimb it; but the Woodman said at once, “I’ll chop it down, and then we\\ncan get the Scarecrow’s clothes.”\\n\\nNow while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the Woodman himself,\\nanother of the Winkies, who was a goldsmith, had made an axe-handle of\\nsolid gold and fitted it to the Woodman’s axe, instead of the old\\nbroken handle. Others polished the blade until all the rust was removed\\nand it glistened like burnished silver.\\n\\nAs soon as he had spoken, the Tin Woodman began to chop, and in a short\\ntime the tree fell over with a crash, whereupon the Scarecrow’s clothes\\nfell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground.\\n\\nDorothy picked them up and had the Winkies carry them back to the\\ncastle, where they were stuffed with nice, clean straw; and behold!\\nhere was the Scarecrow, as good as ever, thanking them over and over\\nagain for saving him.\\n\\nNow that they were reunited, Dorothy and her friends spent a few happy\\ndays at the Yellow Castle, where they found everything they needed to\\nmake them comfortable.\\n\\nBut one day the girl thought of Aunt Em, and said, “We must go back to\\nOz, and claim his promise.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said the Woodman, “at last I shall get my heart.”\\n\\n“And I shall get my brains,” added the Scarecrow joyfully.\\n\\n“And I shall get my courage,” said the Lion thoughtfully.\\n\\n“And I shall get back to Kansas,” cried Dorothy, clapping her hands.\\n“Oh, let us start for the Emerald City tomorrow!”\\n\\nThis they decided to do. The next day they called the Winkies together\\nand bade them good-bye. The Winkies were sorry to have them go, and\\nthey had grown so fond of the Tin Woodman that they begged him to stay\\nand rule over them and the Yellow Land of the West. Finding they were\\ndetermined to go, the Winkies gave Toto and the Lion each a golden\\ncollar; and to Dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with\\ndiamonds; and to the Scarecrow they gave a gold-headed walking stick,\\nto keep him from stumbling; and to the Tin Woodman they offered a\\nsilver oil-can, inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels.\\n\\nEvery one of the travelers made the Winkies a pretty speech in return,\\nand all shook hands with them until their arms ached.\\n\\nDorothy went to the Witch’s cupboard to fill her basket with food for\\nthe journey, and there she saw the Golden Cap. She tried it on her own\\nhead and found that it fitted her exactly. She did not know anything\\nabout the charm of the Golden Cap, but she saw that it was pretty, so\\nshe made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet in the basket.\\n\\nThen, being prepared for the journey, they all started for the Emerald\\nCity; and the Winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to\\ncarry with them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XIV\\nThe Winged Monkeys\\n\\n\\nYou will remember there was no road—not even a pathway—between the\\ncastle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City. When the four\\ntravelers went in search of the Witch she had seen them coming, and so\\nsent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her. It was much harder to\\nfind their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow\\ndaisies than it was being carried. They knew, of course, they must go\\nstraight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off in the right\\nway. But at noon, when the sun was over their heads, they did not know\\nwhich was east and which was west, and that was the reason they were\\nlost in the great fields. They kept on walking, however, and at night\\nthe moon came out and shone brightly. So they lay down among the sweet\\nsmelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning—all but the\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman.\\n\\nThe next morning the sun was behind a cloud, but they started on, as if\\nthey were quite sure which way they were going.\\n\\n“If we walk far enough,” said Dorothy, “I am sure we shall sometime\\ncome to some place.”\\n\\nBut day by day passed away, and they still saw nothing before them but\\nthe scarlet fields. The Scarecrow began to grumble a bit.\\n\\n“We have surely lost our way,” he said, “and unless we find it again in\\ntime to reach the Emerald City, I shall never get my brains.”\\n\\n“Nor I my heart,” declared the Tin Woodman. “It seems to me I can\\nscarcely wait till I get to Oz, and you must admit this is a very long\\njourney.”\\n\\n“You see,” said the Cowardly Lion, with a whimper, “I haven’t the\\ncourage to keep tramping forever, without getting anywhere at all.”\\n\\nThen Dorothy lost heart. She sat down on the grass and looked at her\\ncompanions, and they sat down and looked at her, and Toto found that\\nfor the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly\\nthat flew past his head. So he put out his tongue and panted and looked\\nat Dorothy as if to ask what they should do next.\\n\\n“Suppose we call the field mice,” she suggested. “They could probably\\ntell us the way to the Emerald City.”\\n\\n“To be sure they could,” cried the Scarecrow. “Why didn’t we think of\\nthat before?”\\n\\nDorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck\\nsince the Queen of the Mice had given it to her. In a few minutes they\\nheard the pattering of tiny feet, and many of the small gray mice came\\nrunning up to her. Among them was the Queen herself, who asked, in her\\nsqueaky little voice:\\n\\n“What can I do for my friends?”\\n\\n“We have lost our way,” said Dorothy. “Can you tell us where the\\nEmerald City is?”\\n\\n“Certainly,” answered the Queen; “but it is a great way off, for you\\nhave had it at your backs all this time.” Then she noticed Dorothy’s\\nGolden Cap, and said, “Why don’t you use the charm of the Cap, and call\\nthe Winged Monkeys to you? They will carry you to the City of Oz in\\nless than an hour.”\\n\\n“I didn’t know there was a charm,” answered Dorothy, in surprise. “What\\nis it?”\\n\\n“It is written inside the Golden Cap,” replied the Queen of the Mice.\\n“But if you are going to call the Winged Monkeys we must run away, for\\nthey are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us.”\\n\\n“Won’t they hurt me?” asked the girl anxiously.\\n\\n“Oh, no. They must obey the wearer of the Cap. Good-bye!” And she\\nscampered out of sight, with all the mice hurrying after her.\\n\\nDorothy looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon\\nthe lining. These, she thought, must be the charm, so she read the\\ndirections carefully and put the Cap upon her head.\\n\\n“Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!” she said, standing on her left foot.\\n\\n“What did you say?” asked the Scarecrow, who did not know what she was\\ndoing.\\n\\n“Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!” Dorothy went on, standing this time on her\\nright foot.\\n\\n“Hello!” replied the Tin Woodman calmly.\\n\\n“Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!” said Dorothy, who was now standing on both feet.\\nThis ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great chattering\\nand flapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them.\\n\\nThe King bowed low before Dorothy, and asked, “What is your command?”\\n\\n“We wish to go to the Emerald City,” said the child, “and we have lost\\nour way.”\\n\\n“We will carry you,” replied the King, and no sooner had he spoken than\\ntwo of the Monkeys caught Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her.\\nOthers took the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion, and one little\\nMonkey seized Toto and flew after them, although the dog tried hard to\\nbite him.\\n\\nThe Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were rather frightened at first, for\\nthey remembered how badly the Winged Monkeys had treated them before;\\nbut they saw that no harm was intended, so they rode through the air\\nquite cheerfully, and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and\\nwoods far below them.\\n\\nDorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest Monkeys,\\none of them the King himself. They had made a chair of their hands and\\nwere careful not to hurt her.\\n\\n“Why do you have to obey the charm of the Golden Cap?” she asked.\\n\\n“That is a long story,” answered the King, with a winged laugh; “but as\\nwe have a long journey before us, I will pass the time by telling you\\nabout it, if you wish.”\\n\\n“I shall be glad to hear it,” she replied.\\n\\n“Once,” began the leader, “we were a free people, living happily in the\\ngreat forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit, and\\ndoing just as we pleased without calling anybody master. Perhaps some\\nof us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull\\nthe tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing\\nnuts at the people who walked in the forest. But we were careless and\\nhappy and full of fun, and enjoyed every minute of the day. This was\\nmany years ago, long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this\\nland.\\n\\n“There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who\\nwas also a powerful sorceress. All her magic was used to help the\\npeople, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good. Her name\\nwas Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great\\nblocks of ruby. Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that\\nshe could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much\\ntoo stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise. At last,\\nhowever, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his\\nyears. Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she\\nwould make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used\\nall her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any\\nwoman could wish. When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called,\\nwas said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly\\nbeauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to\\nmake everything ready for the wedding.\\n\\n“My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which\\nlived in the forest near Gayelette’s palace, and the old fellow loved a\\njoke better than a good dinner. One day, just before the wedding, my\\ngrandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking\\nbeside the river. He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and\\npurple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could\\ndo. At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala, carried him in\\ntheir arms until they were over the middle of the river, and then\\ndropped him into the water.\\n\\n“‘Swim out, my fine fellow,’ cried my grandfather, ‘and see if the\\nwater has spotted your clothes.’ Quelala was much too wise not to swim,\\nand he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune. He\\nlaughed, when he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore.\\nBut when Gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and\\nvelvet all ruined by the river.\\n\\n“The princess was angry, and she knew, of course, who did it. She had\\nall the Winged Monkeys brought before her, and she said at first that\\ntheir wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had\\ntreated Quelala, and dropped in the river. But my grandfather pleaded\\nhard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings\\ntied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette\\nfinally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever\\nafter do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap. This\\nCap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to\\nhave cost the princess half her kingdom. Of course my grandfather and\\nall the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how\\nit happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the\\nGolden Cap, whosoever he may be.”\\n\\n“And what became of them?” asked Dorothy, who had been greatly\\ninterested in the story.\\n\\n“Quelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap,” replied the Monkey,\\n“he was the first to lay his wishes upon us. As his bride could not\\nbear the sight of us, he called us all to him in the forest after he\\nhad married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never\\nagain set eyes on a Winged Monkey, which we were glad to do, for we\\nwere all afraid of her.\\n\\n“This was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the\\nhands of the Wicked Witch of the West, who made us enslave the Winkies,\\nand afterward drive Oz himself out of the Land of the West. Now the\\nGolden Cap is yours, and three times you have the right to lay your\\nwishes upon us.”\\n\\nAs the Monkey King finished his story Dorothy looked down and saw the\\ngreen, shining walls of the Emerald City before them. She wondered at\\nthe rapid flight of the Monkeys, but was glad the journey was over. The\\nstrange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of\\nthe City, the King bowed low to Dorothy, and then flew swiftly away,\\nfollowed by all his band.\\n\\n“That was a good ride,” said the little girl.\\n\\n“Yes, and a quick way out of our troubles,” replied the Lion. “How\\nlucky it was you brought away that wonderful Cap!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XV\\nThe Discovery of Oz, the Terrible\\n\\n\\nThe four travelers walked up to the great gate of Emerald City and rang\\nthe bell. After ringing several times, it was opened by the same\\nGuardian of the Gates they had met before.\\n\\n“What! are you back again?” he asked, in surprise.\\n\\n“Do you not see us?” answered the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“But I thought you had gone to visit the Wicked Witch of the West.”\\n\\n“We did visit her,” said the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“And she let you go again?” asked the man, in wonder.\\n\\n“She could not help it, for she is melted,” explained the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“Melted! Well, that is good news, indeed,” said the man. “Who melted\\nher?”\\n\\n“It was Dorothy,” said the Lion gravely.\\n\\n“Good gracious!” exclaimed the man, and he bowed very low indeed before\\nher.\\n\\nThen he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from\\nthe great box on all their eyes, just as he had done before. Afterward\\nthey passed on through the gate into the Emerald City. When the people\\nheard from the Guardian of the Gates that Dorothy had melted the Wicked\\nWitch of the West, they all gathered around the travelers and followed\\nthem in a great crowd to the Palace of Oz.\\n\\nThe soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door,\\nbut he let them in at once, and they were again met by the beautiful\\ngreen girl, who showed each of them to their old rooms at once, so they\\nmight rest until the Great Oz was ready to receive them.\\n\\nThe soldier had the news carried straight to Oz that Dorothy and the\\nother travelers had come back again, after destroying the Wicked Witch;\\nbut Oz made no reply. They thought the Great Wizard would send for them\\nat once, but he did not. They had no word from him the next day, nor\\nthe next, nor the next. The waiting was tiresome and wearing, and at\\nlast they grew vexed that Oz should treat them in so poor a fashion,\\nafter sending them to undergo hardships and slavery. So the Scarecrow\\nat last asked the green girl to take another message to Oz, saying if\\nhe did not let them in to see him at once they would call the Winged\\nMonkeys to help them, and find out whether he kept his promises or not.\\nWhen the Wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he\\nsent word for them to come to the Throne Room at four minutes after\\nnine o’clock the next morning. He had once met the Winged Monkeys in\\nthe Land of the West, and he did not wish to meet them again.\\n\\nThe four travelers passed a sleepless night, each thinking of the gift\\nOz had promised to bestow on him. Dorothy fell asleep only once, and\\nthen she dreamed she was in Kansas, where Aunt Em was telling her how\\nglad she was to have her little girl at home again.\\n\\nPromptly at nine o’clock the next morning the green-whiskered soldier\\ncame to them, and four minutes later they all went into the Throne Room\\nof the Great Oz.\\n\\nOf course each one of them expected to see the Wizard in the shape he\\nhad taken before, and all were greatly surprised when they looked about\\nand saw no one at all in the room. They kept close to the door and\\ncloser to one another, for the stillness of the empty room was more\\ndreadful than any of the forms they had seen Oz take.\\n\\nPresently they heard a solemn Voice, that seemed to come from somewhere\\nnear the top of the great dome, and it said:\\n\\n“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Why do you seek me?”\\n\\nThey looked again in every part of the room, and then, seeing no one,\\nDorothy asked, “Where are you?”\\n\\n“I am everywhere,” answered the Voice, “but to the eyes of common\\nmortals I am invisible. I will now seat myself upon my throne, that you\\nmay converse with me.” Indeed, the Voice seemed just then to come\\nstraight from the throne itself; so they walked toward it and stood in\\na row while Dorothy said:\\n\\n“We have come to claim our promise, O Oz.”\\n\\n“What promise?” asked Oz.\\n\\n“You promised to send me back to Kansas when the Wicked Witch was\\ndestroyed,” said the girl.\\n\\n“And you promised to give me brains,” said the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“And you promised to give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“And you promised to give me courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.\\n\\n“Is the Wicked Witch really destroyed?” asked the Voice, and Dorothy\\nthought it trembled a little.\\n\\n“Yes,” she answered, “I melted her with a bucket of water.”\\n\\n“Dear me,” said the Voice, “how sudden! Well, come to me tomorrow, for\\nI must have time to think it over.”\\n\\n“You’ve had plenty of time already,” said the Tin Woodman angrily.\\n\\n“We shan’t wait a day longer,” said the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“You must keep your promises to us!” exclaimed Dorothy.\\n\\nThe Lion thought it might be as well to frighten the Wizard, so he gave\\na large, loud roar, which was so fierce and dreadful that Toto jumped\\naway from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a\\ncorner. As it fell with a crash they looked that way, and the next\\nmoment all of them were filled with wonder. For they saw, standing in\\njust the spot the screen had hidden, a little old man, with a bald head\\nand a wrinkled face, who seemed to be as much surprised as they were.\\nThe Tin Woodman, raising his axe, rushed toward the little man and\\ncried out, “Who are you?”\\n\\n“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,” said the little man, in a trembling\\nvoice. “But don’t strike me—please don’t—and I’ll do anything you want\\nme to.”\\n\\nOur friends looked at him in surprise and dismay.\\n\\n“I thought Oz was a great Head,” said Dorothy.\\n\\n“And I thought Oz was a lovely Lady,” said the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“And I thought Oz was a terrible Beast,” said the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“And I thought Oz was a Ball of Fire,” exclaimed the Lion.\\n\\n“No, you are all wrong,” said the little man meekly. “I have been\\nmaking believe.”\\n\\n“Making believe!” cried Dorothy. “Are you not a Great Wizard?”\\n\\n“Hush, my dear,” he said. “Don’t speak so loud, or you will be\\noverheard—and I should be ruined. I’m supposed to be a Great Wizard.”\\n\\n“And aren’t you?” she asked.\\n\\n“Not a bit of it, my dear; I’m just a common man.”\\n\\n“You’re more than that,” said the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone; “you’re\\na humbug.”\\n\\n“Exactly so!” declared the little man, rubbing his hands together as if\\nit pleased him. “I am a humbug.”\\n\\n“But this is terrible,” said the Tin Woodman. “How shall I ever get my\\nheart?”\\n\\n“Or I my courage?” asked the Lion.\\n\\n“Or I my brains?” wailed the Scarecrow, wiping the tears from his eyes\\nwith his coat sleeve.\\n\\n“My dear friends,” said Oz, “I pray you not to speak of these little\\nthings. Think of me, and the terrible trouble I’m in at being found\\nout.”\\n\\n“Doesn’t anyone else know you’re a humbug?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“No one knows it but you four—and myself,” replied Oz. “I have fooled\\neveryone so long that I thought I should never be found out. It was a\\ngreat mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room. Usually I will\\nnot see even my subjects, and so they believe I am something terrible.”\\n\\n“But, I don’t understand,” said Dorothy, in bewilderment. “How was it\\nthat you appeared to me as a great Head?”\\n\\n“That was one of my tricks,” answered Oz. “Step this way, please, and I\\nwill tell you all about it.”\\n\\nHe led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room, and\\nthey all followed him. He pointed to one corner, in which lay the great\\nHead, made out of many thicknesses of paper, and with a carefully\\npainted face.\\n\\n“This I hung from the ceiling by a wire,” said Oz. “I stood behind the\\nscreen and pulled a thread, to make the eyes move and the mouth open.”\\n\\n“But how about the voice?” she inquired.\\n\\n“Oh, I am a ventriloquist,” said the little man. “I can throw the sound\\nof my voice wherever I wish, so that you thought it was coming out of\\nthe Head. Here are the other things I used to deceive you.” He showed\\nthe Scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be\\nthe lovely Lady. And the Tin Woodman saw that his terrible Beast was\\nnothing but a lot of skins, sewn together, with slats to keep their\\nsides out. As for the Ball of Fire, the false Wizard had hung that also\\nfrom the ceiling. It was really a ball of cotton, but when oil was\\npoured upon it the ball burned fiercely.\\n\\n“Really,” said the Scarecrow, “you ought to be ashamed of yourself for\\nbeing such a humbug.”\\n\\n“I am—I certainly am,” answered the little man sorrowfully; “but it was\\nthe only thing I could do. Sit down, please, there are plenty of\\nchairs; and I will tell you my story.”\\n\\nSo they sat down and listened while he told the following tale.\\n\\n“I was born in Omaha—”\\n\\n“Why, that isn’t very far from Kansas!” cried Dorothy.\\n\\n“No, but it’s farther from here,” he said, shaking his head at her\\nsadly. “When I grew up I became a ventriloquist, and at that I was very\\nwell trained by a great master. I can imitate any kind of a bird or\\nbeast.” Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his ears\\nand looked everywhere to see where she was. “After a time,” continued\\nOz, “I tired of that, and became a balloonist.”\\n\\n“What is that?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as to draw a crowd of\\npeople together and get them to pay to see the circus,” he explained.\\n\\n“Oh,” she said, “I know.”\\n\\n“Well, one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted, so\\nthat I couldn’t come down again. It went way up above the clouds, so\\nfar that a current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles\\naway. For a day and a night I traveled through the air, and on the\\nmorning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over a\\nstrange and beautiful country.\\n\\n“It came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit. But I found myself\\nin the midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds,\\nthought I was a great Wizard. Of course I let them think so, because\\nthey were afraid of me, and promised to do anything I wished them to.\\n\\n“Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to\\nbuild this City, and my Palace; and they did it all willingly and well.\\nThen I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call\\nit the Emerald City; and to make the name fit better I put green\\nspectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green.”\\n\\n“But isn’t everything here green?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“No more than in any other city,” replied Oz; “but when you wear green\\nspectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you. The\\nEmerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man\\nwhen the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man now. But my\\npeople have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them\\nthink it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful\\nplace, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing\\nthat is needed to make one happy. I have been good to the people, and\\nthey like me; but ever since this Palace was built, I have shut myself\\nup and would not see any of them.\\n\\n“One of my greatest fears was the Witches, for while I had no magical\\npowers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to do\\nwonderful things. There were four of them in this country, and they\\nruled the people who live in the North and South and East and West.\\nFortunately, the Witches of the North and South were good, and I knew\\nthey would do me no harm; but the Witches of the East and West were\\nterribly wicked, and had they not thought I was more powerful than they\\nthemselves, they would surely have destroyed me. As it was, I lived in\\ndeadly fear of them for many years; so you can imagine how pleased I\\nwas when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East.\\nWhen you came to me, I was willing to promise anything if you would\\nonly do away with the other Witch; but, now that you have melted her, I\\nam ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises.”\\n\\n“I think you are a very bad man,” said Dorothy.\\n\\n“Oh, no, my dear; I’m really a very good man, but I’m a very bad\\nWizard, I must admit.”\\n\\n“Can’t you give me brains?” asked the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“You don’t need them. You are learning something every day. A baby has\\nbrains, but it doesn’t know much. Experience is the only thing that\\nbrings knowledge, and the longer you are on earth the more experience\\nyou are sure to get.”\\n\\n“That may all be true,” said the Scarecrow, “but I shall be very\\nunhappy unless you give me brains.”\\n\\nThe false Wizard looked at him carefully.\\n\\n“Well,” he said with a sigh, “I’m not much of a magician, as I said;\\nbut if you will come to me tomorrow morning, I will stuff your head\\nwith brains. I cannot tell you how to use them, however; you must find\\nthat out for yourself.”\\n\\n“Oh, thank you—thank you!” cried the Scarecrow. “I’ll find a way to use\\nthem, never fear!”\\n\\n“But how about my courage?” asked the Lion anxiously.\\n\\n“You have plenty of courage, I am sure,” answered Oz. “All you need is\\nconfidence in yourself. There is no living thing that is not afraid\\nwhen it faces danger. The True courage is in facing danger when you are\\nafraid, and that kind of courage you have in plenty.”\\n\\n“Perhaps I have, but I’m scared just the same,” said the Lion. “I shall\\nreally be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that\\nmakes one forget he is afraid.”\\n\\n“Very well, I will give you that sort of courage tomorrow,” replied Oz.\\n\\n“How about my heart?” asked the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“Why, as for that,” answered Oz, “I think you are wrong to want a\\nheart. It makes most people unhappy. If you only knew it, you are in\\nluck not to have a heart.”\\n\\n“That must be a matter of opinion,” said the Tin Woodman. “For my part,\\nI will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur, if you will give me\\nthe heart.”\\n\\n“Very well,” answered Oz meekly. “Come to me tomorrow and you shall\\nhave a heart. I have played Wizard for so many years that I may as well\\ncontinue the part a little longer.”\\n\\n“And now,” said Dorothy, “how am I to get back to Kansas?”\\n\\n“We shall have to think about that,” replied the little man. “Give me\\ntwo or three days to consider the matter and I’ll try to find a way to\\ncarry you over the desert. In the meantime you shall all be treated as\\nmy guests, and while you live in the Palace my people will wait upon\\nyou and obey your slightest wish. There is only one thing I ask in\\nreturn for my help—such as it is. You must keep my secret and tell no\\none I am a humbug.”\\n\\nThey agreed to say nothing of what they had learned, and went back to\\ntheir rooms in high spirits. Even Dorothy had hope that “The Great and\\nTerrible Humbug,” as she called him, would find a way to send her back\\nto Kansas, and if he did she was willing to forgive him everything.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XVI\\nThe Magic Art of the Great Humbug\\n\\n\\nNext morning the Scarecrow said to his friends:\\n\\n“Congratulate me. I am going to Oz to get my brains at last. When I\\nreturn I shall be as other men are.”\\n\\n“I have always liked you as you were,” said Dorothy simply.\\n\\n“It is kind of you to like a Scarecrow,” he replied. “But surely you\\nwill think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain\\nis going to turn out.” Then he said good-bye to them all in a cheerful\\nvoice and went to the Throne Room, where he rapped upon the door.\\n\\n“Come in,” said Oz.\\n\\nThe Scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the\\nwindow, engaged in deep thought.\\n\\n“I have come for my brains,” remarked the Scarecrow, a little uneasily.\\n\\n“Oh, yes; sit down in that chair, please,” replied Oz. “You must excuse\\nme for taking your head off, but I shall have to do it in order to put\\nyour brains in their proper place.”\\n\\n“That’s all right,” said the Scarecrow. “You are quite welcome to take\\nmy head off, as long as it will be a better one when you put it on\\nagain.”\\n\\nSo the Wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw. Then he\\nentered the back room and took up a measure of bran, which he mixed\\nwith a great many pins and needles. Having shaken them together\\nthoroughly, he filled the top of the Scarecrow’s head with the mixture\\nand stuffed the rest of the space with straw, to hold it in place.\\n\\nWhen he had fastened the Scarecrow’s head on his body again he said to\\nhim, “Hereafter you will be a great man, for I have given you a lot of\\nbran-new brains.”\\n\\nThe Scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his\\ngreatest wish, and having thanked Oz warmly he went back to his\\nfriends.\\n\\nDorothy looked at him curiously. His head was quite bulged out at the\\ntop with brains.\\n\\n“How do you feel?” she asked.\\n\\n“I feel wise indeed,” he answered earnestly. “When I get used to my\\nbrains I shall know everything.”\\n\\n“Why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head?” asked the\\nTin Woodman.\\n\\n“That is proof that he is sharp,” remarked the Lion.\\n\\n“Well, I must go to Oz and get my heart,” said the Woodman. So he\\nwalked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.\\n\\n“Come in,” called Oz, and the Woodman entered and said, “I have come\\nfor my heart.”\\n\\n“Very well,” answered the little man. “But I shall have to cut a hole\\nin your breast, so I can put your heart in the right place. I hope it\\nwon’t hurt you.”\\n\\n“Oh, no,” answered the Woodman. “I shall not feel it at all.”\\n\\nSo Oz brought a pair of tinsmith’s shears and cut a small, square hole\\nin the left side of the Tin Woodman’s breast. Then, going to a chest of\\ndrawers, he took out a pretty heart, made entirely of silk and stuffed\\nwith sawdust.\\n\\n“Isn’t it a beauty?” he asked.\\n\\n“It is, indeed!” replied the Woodman, who was greatly pleased. “But is\\nit a kind heart?”\\n\\n“Oh, very!” answered Oz. He put the heart in the Woodman’s breast and\\nthen replaced the square of tin, soldering it neatly together where it\\nhad been cut.\\n\\n“There,” said he; “now you have a heart that any man might be proud of.\\nI’m sorry I had to put a patch on your breast, but it really couldn’t\\nbe helped.”\\n\\n“Never mind the patch,” exclaimed the happy Woodman. “I am very\\ngrateful to you, and shall never forget your kindness.”\\n\\n“Don’t speak of it,” replied Oz.\\n\\nThen the Tin Woodman went back to his friends, who wished him every joy\\non account of his good fortune.\\n\\nThe Lion now walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.\\n\\n“Come in,” said Oz.\\n\\n“I have come for my courage,” announced the Lion, entering the room.\\n\\n“Very well,” answered the little man; “I will get it for you.”\\n\\nHe went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a\\nsquare green bottle, the contents of which he poured into a green-gold\\ndish, beautifully carved. Placing this before the Cowardly Lion, who\\nsniffed at it as if he did not like it, the Wizard said:\\n\\n“Drink.”\\n\\n“What is it?” asked the Lion.\\n\\n“Well,” answered Oz, “if it were inside of you, it would be courage.\\nYou know, of course, that courage is always inside one; so that this\\nreally cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it. Therefore\\nI advise you to drink it as soon as possible.”\\n\\nThe Lion hesitated no longer, but drank till the dish was empty.\\n\\n“How do you feel now?” asked Oz.\\n\\n“Full of courage,” replied the Lion, who went joyfully back to his\\nfriends to tell them of his good fortune.\\n\\nOz, left to himself, smiled to think of his success in giving the\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion exactly what they thought\\nthey wanted. “How can I help being a humbug,” he said, “when all these\\npeople make me do things that everybody knows can’t be done? It was\\neasy to make the Scarecrow and the Lion and the Woodman happy, because\\nthey imagined I could do anything. But it will take more than\\nimagination to carry Dorothy back to Kansas, and I’m sure I don’t know\\nhow it can be done.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XVII\\nHow the Balloon Was Launched\\n\\n\\nFor three days Dorothy heard nothing from Oz. These were sad days for\\nthe little girl, although her friends were all quite happy and\\ncontented. The Scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his\\nhead; but he would not say what they were because he knew no one could\\nunderstand them but himself. When the Tin Woodman walked about he felt\\nhis heart rattling around in his breast; and he told Dorothy he had\\ndiscovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one he had\\nowned when he was made of flesh. The Lion declared he was afraid of\\nnothing on earth, and would gladly face an army or a dozen of the\\nfierce Kalidahs.\\n\\nThus each of the little party was satisfied except Dorothy, who longed\\nmore than ever to get back to Kansas.\\n\\nOn the fourth day, to her great joy, Oz sent for her, and when she\\nentered the Throne Room he greeted her pleasantly:\\n\\n“Sit down, my dear; I think I have found the way to get you out of this\\ncountry.”\\n\\n“And back to Kansas?” she asked eagerly.\\n\\n“Well, I’m not sure about Kansas,” said Oz, “for I haven’t the faintest\\nnotion which way it lies. But the first thing to do is to cross the\\ndesert, and then it should be easy to find your way home.”\\n\\n“How can I cross the desert?” she inquired.\\n\\n“Well, I’ll tell you what I think,” said the little man. “You see, when\\nI came to this country it was in a balloon. You also came through the\\nair, being carried by a cyclone. So I believe the best way to get\\nacross the desert will be through the air. Now, it is quite beyond my\\npowers to make a cyclone; but I’ve been thinking the matter over, and I\\nbelieve I can make a balloon.”\\n\\n“How?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“A balloon,” said Oz, “is made of silk, which is coated with glue to\\nkeep the gas in it. I have plenty of silk in the Palace, so it will be\\nno trouble to make the balloon. But in all this country there is no gas\\nto fill the balloon with, to make it float.”\\n\\n“If it won’t float,” remarked Dorothy, “it will be of no use to us.”\\n\\n“True,” answered Oz. “But there is another way to make it float, which\\nis to fill it with hot air. Hot air isn’t as good as gas, for if the\\nair should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert, and we\\nshould be lost.”\\n\\n“We!” exclaimed the girl. “Are you going with me?”\\n\\n“Yes, of course,” replied Oz. “I am tired of being such a humbug. If I\\nshould go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am not a\\nWizard, and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them.\\nSo I have to stay shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets tiresome.\\nI’d much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again.”\\n\\n“I shall be glad to have your company,” said Dorothy.\\n\\n“Thank you,” he answered. “Now, if you will help me sew the silk\\ntogether, we will begin to work on our balloon.”\\n\\nSo Dorothy took a needle and thread, and as fast as Oz cut the strips\\nof silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together. First\\nthere was a strip of light green silk, then a strip of dark green and\\nthen a strip of emerald green; for Oz had a fancy to make the balloon\\nin different shades of the color about them. It took three days to sew\\nall the strips together, but when it was finished they had a big bag of\\ngreen silk more than twenty feet long.\\n\\nThen Oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue, to make it\\nairtight, after which he announced that the balloon was ready.\\n\\n“But we must have a basket to ride in,” he said. So he sent the soldier\\nwith the green whiskers for a big clothes basket, which he fastened\\nwith many ropes to the bottom of the balloon.\\n\\nWhen it was all ready, Oz sent word to his people that he was going to\\nmake a visit to a great brother Wizard who lived in the clouds. The\\nnews spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the\\nwonderful sight.\\n\\nOz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the Palace, and the\\npeople gazed upon it with much curiosity. The Tin Woodman had chopped a\\nbig pile of wood, and now he made a fire of it, and Oz held the bottom\\nof the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it\\nwould be caught in the silken bag. Gradually the balloon swelled out\\nand rose into the air, until finally the basket just touched the\\nground.\\n\\nThen Oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice:\\n\\n“I am now going away to make a visit. While I am gone the Scarecrow\\nwill rule over you. I command you to obey him as you would me.”\\n\\nThe balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to\\nthe ground, for the air within it was hot, and this made it so much\\nlighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into\\nthe sky.\\n\\n“Come, Dorothy!” cried the Wizard. “Hurry up, or the balloon will fly\\naway.”\\n\\n“I can’t find Toto anywhere,” replied Dorothy, who did not wish to\\nleave her little dog behind. Toto had run into the crowd to bark at a\\nkitten, and Dorothy at last found him. She picked him up and ran\\ntowards the balloon.\\n\\nShe was within a few steps of it, and Oz was holding out his hands to\\nhelp her into the basket, when, crack! went the ropes, and the balloon\\nrose into the air without her.\\n\\n“Come back!” she screamed. “I want to go, too!”\\n\\n“I can’t come back, my dear,” called Oz from the basket. “Good-bye!”\\n\\n“Good-bye!” shouted everyone, and all eyes were turned upward to where\\nthe Wizard was riding in the basket, rising every moment farther and\\nfarther into the sky.\\n\\nAnd that was the last any of them ever saw of Oz, the Wonderful Wizard,\\nthough he may have reached Omaha safely, and be there now, for all we\\nknow. But the people remembered him lovingly, and said to one another:\\n\\n“Oz was always our friend. When he was here he built for us this\\nbeautiful Emerald City, and now he is gone he has left the Wise\\nScarecrow to rule over us.”\\n\\nStill, for many days they grieved over the loss of the Wonderful\\nWizard, and would not be comforted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XVIII\\nAway to the South\\n\\n\\nDorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to Kansas\\nagain; but when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone\\nup in a balloon. And she also felt sorry at losing Oz, and so did her\\ncompanions.\\n\\nThe Tin Woodman came to her and said:\\n\\n“Truly I should be ungrateful if I failed to mourn for the man who gave\\nme my lovely heart. I should like to cry a little because Oz is gone,\\nif you will kindly wipe away my tears, so that I shall not rust.”\\n\\n“With pleasure,” she answered, and brought a towel at once. Then the\\nTin Woodman wept for several minutes, and she watched the tears\\ncarefully and wiped them away with the towel. When he had finished, he\\nthanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his jeweled\\noil-can, to guard against mishap.\\n\\nThe Scarecrow was now the ruler of the Emerald City, and although he\\nwas not a Wizard the people were proud of him. “For,” they said, “there\\nis not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed man.”\\nAnd, so far as they knew, they were quite right.\\n\\nThe morning after the balloon had gone up with Oz, the four travelers\\nmet in the Throne Room and talked matters over. The Scarecrow sat in\\nthe big throne and the others stood respectfully before him.\\n\\n“We are not so unlucky,” said the new ruler, “for this Palace and the\\nEmerald City belong to us, and we can do just as we please. When I\\nremember that a short time ago I was up on a pole in a farmer’s\\ncornfield, and that now I am the ruler of this beautiful City, I am\\nquite satisfied with my lot.”\\n\\n“I also,” said the Tin Woodman, “am well-pleased with my new heart;\\nand, really, that was the only thing I wished in all the world.”\\n\\n“For my part, I am content in knowing I am as brave as any beast that\\never lived, if not braver,” said the Lion modestly.\\n\\n“If Dorothy would only be contented to live in the Emerald City,”\\ncontinued the Scarecrow, “we might all be happy together.”\\n\\n“But I don’t want to live here,” cried Dorothy. “I want to go to\\nKansas, and live with Aunt Em and Uncle Henry.”\\n\\n“Well, then, what can be done?” inquired the Woodman.\\n\\nThe Scarecrow decided to think, and he thought so hard that the pins\\nand needles began to stick out of his brains. Finally he said:\\n\\n“Why not call the Winged Monkeys, and ask them to carry you over the\\ndesert?”\\n\\n“I never thought of that!” said Dorothy joyfully. “It’s just the thing.\\nI’ll go at once for the Golden Cap.”\\n\\nWhen she brought it into the Throne Room she spoke the magic words, and\\nsoon the band of Winged Monkeys flew in through the open window and\\nstood beside her.\\n\\n“This is the second time you have called us,” said the Monkey King,\\nbowing before the little girl. “What do you wish?”\\n\\n“I want you to fly with me to Kansas,” said Dorothy.\\n\\nBut the Monkey King shook his head.\\n\\n“That cannot be done,” he said. “We belong to this country alone, and\\ncannot leave it. There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet,\\nand I suppose there never will be, for they don’t belong there. We\\nshall be glad to serve you in any way in our power, but we cannot cross\\nthe desert. Good-bye.”\\n\\nAnd with another bow, the Monkey King spread his wings and flew away\\nthrough the window, followed by all his band.\\n\\nDorothy was ready to cry with disappointment. “I have wasted the charm\\nof the Golden Cap to no purpose,” she said, “for the Winged Monkeys\\ncannot help me.”\\n\\n“It is certainly too bad!” said the tender-hearted Woodman.\\n\\nThe Scarecrow was thinking again, and his head bulged out so horribly\\nthat Dorothy feared it would burst.\\n\\n“Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers,” he said, “and ask\\nhis advice.”\\n\\nSo the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly, for\\nwhile Oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door.\\n\\n“This little girl,” said the Scarecrow to the soldier, “wishes to cross\\nthe desert. How can she do so?”\\n\\n“I cannot tell,” answered the soldier, “for nobody has ever crossed the\\ndesert, unless it is Oz himself.”\\n\\n“Is there no one who can help me?” asked Dorothy earnestly.\\n\\n“Glinda might,” he suggested.\\n\\n“Who is Glinda?” inquired the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“The Witch of the South. She is the most powerful of all the Witches,\\nand rules over the Quadlings. Besides, her castle stands on the edge of\\nthe desert, so she may know a way to cross it.”\\n\\n“Glinda is a Good Witch, isn’t she?” asked the child.\\n\\n“The Quadlings think she is good,” said the soldier, “and she is kind\\nto everyone. I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman, who knows\\nhow to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived.”\\n\\n“How can I get to her castle?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“The road is straight to the South,” he answered, “but it is said to be\\nfull of dangers to travelers. There are wild beasts in the woods, and a\\nrace of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country. For\\nthis reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald City.”\\n\\nThe soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said:\\n\\n“It seems, in spite of dangers, that the best thing Dorothy can do is\\nto travel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her. For, of\\ncourse, if Dorothy stays here she will never get back to Kansas.”\\n\\n“You must have been thinking again,” remarked the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“I have,” said the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“I shall go with Dorothy,” declared the Lion, “for I am tired of your\\ncity and long for the woods and the country again. I am really a wild\\nbeast, you know. Besides, Dorothy will need someone to protect her.”\\n\\n“That is true,” agreed the Woodman. “My axe may be of service to her;\\nso I also will go with her to the Land of the South.”\\n\\n“When shall we start?” asked the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“Are you going?” they asked, in surprise.\\n\\n“Certainly. If it wasn’t for Dorothy I should never have had brains.\\nShe lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the\\nEmerald City. So my good luck is all due to her, and I shall never\\nleave her until she starts back to Kansas for good and all.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” said Dorothy gratefully. “You are all very kind to me. But\\nI should like to start as soon as possible.”\\n\\n“We shall go tomorrow morning,” returned the Scarecrow. “So now let us\\nall get ready, for it will be a long journey.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XIX\\nAttacked by the Fighting Trees\\n\\n\\nThe next morning Dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good-bye, and\\nthey all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers, who had\\nwalked with them as far as the gate. When the Guardian of the Gate saw\\nthem again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful City\\nto get into new trouble. But he at once unlocked their spectacles,\\nwhich he put back into the green box, and gave them many good wishes to\\ncarry with them.\\n\\n“You are now our ruler,” he said to the Scarecrow; “so you must come\\nback to us as soon as possible.”\\n\\n“I certainly shall if I am able,” the Scarecrow replied; “but I must\\nhelp Dorothy to get home, first.”\\n\\nAs Dorothy bade the good-natured Guardian a last farewell she said:\\n\\n“I have been very kindly treated in your lovely City, and everyone has\\nbeen good to me. I cannot tell you how grateful I am.”\\n\\n“Don’t try, my dear,” he answered. “We should like to keep you with us,\\nbut if it is your wish to return to Kansas, I hope you will find a\\nway.” He then opened the gate of the outer wall, and they walked forth\\nand started upon their journey.\\n\\nThe sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the\\nLand of the South. They were all in the best of spirits, and laughed\\nand chatted together. Dorothy was once more filled with the hope of\\ngetting home, and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were glad to be of\\nuse to her. As for the Lion, he sniffed the fresh air with delight and\\nwhisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country\\nagain, while Toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies,\\nbarking merrily all the time.\\n\\n“City life does not agree with me at all,” remarked the Lion, as they\\nwalked along at a brisk pace. “I have lost much flesh since I lived\\nthere, and now I am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how\\ncourageous I have grown.”\\n\\nThey now turned and took a last look at the Emerald City. All they\\ncould see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls, and\\nhigh up above everything the spires and dome of the Palace of Oz.\\n\\n“Oz was not such a bad Wizard, after all,” said the Tin Woodman, as he\\nfelt his heart rattling around in his breast.\\n\\n“He knew how to give me brains, and very good brains, too,” said the\\nScarecrow.\\n\\n“If Oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me,” added the\\nLion, “he would have been a brave man.”\\n\\nDorothy said nothing. Oz had not kept the promise he made her, but he\\nhad done his best, so she forgave him. As he said, he was a good man,\\neven if he was a bad Wizard.\\n\\nThe first day’s journey was through the green fields and bright flowers\\nthat stretched about the Emerald City on every side. They slept that\\nnight on the grass, with nothing but the stars over them; and they\\nrested very well indeed.\\n\\nIn the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood. There\\nwas no way of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and\\nleft as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change\\nthe direction of their journey for fear of getting lost. So they looked\\nfor the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest.\\n\\nThe Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with\\nsuch wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass\\nunderneath. So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came under\\nthe first branches they bent down and twined around him, and the next\\nminute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his\\nfellow travelers.\\n\\nThis did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised him, and he looked\\nrather dizzy when Dorothy picked him up.\\n\\n“Here is another space between the trees,” called the Lion.\\n\\n“Let me try it first,” said the Scarecrow, “for it doesn’t hurt me to\\nget thrown about.” He walked up to another tree, as he spoke, but its\\nbranches immediately seized him and tossed him back again.\\n\\n“This is strange,” exclaimed Dorothy. “What shall we do?”\\n\\n“The trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us, and stop our\\njourney,” remarked the Lion.\\n\\n“I believe I will try it myself,” said the Woodman, and shouldering his\\naxe, he marched up to the first tree that had handled the Scarecrow so\\nroughly. When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped\\nat it so fiercely that he cut it in two. At once the tree began shaking\\nall its branches as if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed safely under\\nit.\\n\\n“Come on!” he shouted to the others. “Be quick!” They all ran forward\\nand passed under the tree without injury, except Toto, who was caught\\nby a small branch and shaken until he howled. But the Woodman promptly\\nchopped off the branch and set the little dog free.\\n\\nThe other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they\\nmade up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down\\ntheir branches, and that probably these were the policemen of the\\nforest, and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out\\nof it.\\n\\nThe four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came\\nto the farther edge of the wood. Then, to their surprise, they found\\nbefore them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china. It was\\nsmooth, like the surface of a dish, and higher than their heads.\\n\\n“What shall we do now?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“I will make a ladder,” said the Tin Woodman, “for we certainly must\\nclimb over the wall.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XX\\nThe Dainty China Country\\n\\n\\nWhile the Woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the\\nforest Dorothy lay down and slept, for she was tired by the long walk.\\nThe Lion also curled himself up to sleep and Toto lay beside him.\\n\\nThe Scarecrow watched the Woodman while he worked, and said to him:\\n\\n“I cannot think why this wall is here, nor what it is made of.”\\n\\n“Rest your brains and do not worry about the wall,” replied the\\nWoodman. “When we have climbed over it, we shall know what is on the\\nother side.”\\n\\nAfter a time the ladder was finished. It looked clumsy, but the Tin\\nWoodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose. The\\nScarecrow waked Dorothy and the Lion and Toto, and told them that the\\nladder was ready. The Scarecrow climbed up the ladder first, but he was\\nso awkward that Dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from\\nfalling off. When he got his head over the top of the wall the\\nScarecrow said, “Oh, my!”\\n\\n“Go on,” exclaimed Dorothy.\\n\\nSo the Scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the\\nwall, and Dorothy put her head over and cried, “Oh, my!” just as the\\nScarecrow had done.\\n\\nThen Toto came up, and immediately began to bark, but Dorothy made him\\nbe still.\\n\\nThe Lion climbed the ladder next, and the Tin Woodman came last; but\\nboth of them cried, “Oh, my!” as soon as they looked over the wall.\\nWhen they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall, they looked\\ndown and saw a strange sight.\\n\\nBefore them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and\\nshining and white as the bottom of a big platter. Scattered around were\\nmany houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors.\\nThese houses were quite small, the biggest of them reaching only as\\nhigh as Dorothy’s waist. There were also pretty little barns, with\\nchina fences around them; and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs\\nand chickens, all made of china, were standing about in groups.\\n\\nBut the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer\\ncountry. There were milkmaids and shepherdesses, with brightly colored\\nbodices and golden spots all over their gowns; and princesses with most\\ngorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple; and shepherds dressed in\\nknee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them, and\\ngolden buckles on their shoes; and princes with jeweled crowns upon\\ntheir heads, wearing ermine robes and satin doublets; and funny clowns\\nin ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall,\\npointed caps. And, strangest of all, these people were all made of\\nchina, even to their clothes, and were so small that the tallest of\\nthem was no higher than Dorothy’s knee.\\n\\nNo one did so much as look at the travelers at first, except one little\\npurple china dog with an extra-large head, which came to the wall and\\nbarked at them in a tiny voice, afterwards running away again.\\n\\n“How shall we get down?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\nThey found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up, so the\\nScarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that\\nthe hard floor would not hurt their feet. Of course they took pains not\\nto light on his head and get the pins in their feet. When all were\\nsafely down they picked up the Scarecrow, whose body was quite\\nflattened out, and patted his straw into shape again.\\n\\n“We must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side,”\\nsaid Dorothy, “for it would be unwise for us to go any other way except\\ndue South.”\\n\\nThey began walking through the country of the china people, and the\\nfirst thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow. As\\nthey drew near, the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool,\\nthe pail, and even the milkmaid herself, and all fell on the china\\nground with a great clatter.\\n\\nDorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off, and\\nthat the pail was lying in several small pieces, while the poor\\nmilkmaid had a nick in her left elbow.\\n\\n“There!” cried the milkmaid angrily. “See what you have done! My cow\\nhas broken her leg, and I must take her to the mender’s shop and have\\nit glued on again. What do you mean by coming here and frightening my\\ncow?”\\n\\n“I’m very sorry,” returned Dorothy. “Please forgive us.”\\n\\nBut the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer. She\\npicked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping\\non three legs. As she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful\\nglances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers, holding her nicked\\nelbow close to her side.\\n\\nDorothy was quite grieved at this mishap.\\n\\n“We must be very careful here,” said the kind-hearted Woodman, “or we\\nmay hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it.”\\n\\nA little farther on Dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young\\nPrincess, who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run\\naway.\\n\\nDorothy wanted to see more of the Princess, so she ran after her. But\\nthe china girl cried out:\\n\\n“Don’t chase me! Don’t chase me!”\\n\\nShe had such a frightened little voice that Dorothy stopped and said,\\n“Why not?”\\n\\n“Because,” answered the Princess, also stopping, a safe distance away,\\n“if I run I may fall down and break myself.”\\n\\n“But could you not be mended?” asked the girl.\\n\\n“Oh, yes; but one is never so pretty after being mended, you know,”\\nreplied the Princess.\\n\\n“I suppose not,” said Dorothy.\\n\\n“Now there is Mr. Joker, one of our clowns,” continued the china lady,\\n“who is always trying to stand upon his head. He has broken himself so\\noften that he is mended in a hundred places, and doesn’t look at all\\npretty. Here he comes now, so you can see for yourself.”\\n\\nIndeed, a jolly little clown came walking toward them, and Dorothy\\ncould see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and\\ngreen he was completely covered with cracks, running every which way\\nand showing plainly that he had been mended in many places.\\n\\nThe Clown put his hands in his pockets, and after puffing out his\\ncheeks and nodding his head at them saucily, he said:\\n\\n    “My lady fair,\\n   Why do you stare\\nAt poor old Mr. Joker?\\n    You’re quite as stiff\\n    And prim as if\\nYou’d eaten up a poker!”\\n\\n\\n“Be quiet, sir!” said the Princess. “Can’t you see these are strangers,\\nand should be treated with respect?”\\n\\n“Well, that’s respect, I expect,” declared the Clown, and immediately\\nstood upon his head.\\n\\n“Don’t mind Mr. Joker,” said the Princess to Dorothy. “He is\\nconsiderably cracked in his head, and that makes him foolish.”\\n\\n“Oh, I don’t mind him a bit,” said Dorothy. “But you are so beautiful,”\\nshe continued, “that I am sure I could love you dearly. Won’t you let\\nme carry you back to Kansas, and stand you on Aunt Em’s mantel? I could\\ncarry you in my basket.”\\n\\n“That would make me very unhappy,” answered the china Princess. “You\\nsee, here in our country we live contentedly, and can talk and move\\naround as we please. But whenever any of us are taken away our joints\\nat once stiffen, and we can only stand straight and look pretty. Of\\ncourse that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and\\ncabinets and drawing-room tables, but our lives are much pleasanter\\nhere in our own country.”\\n\\n“I would not make you unhappy for all the world!” exclaimed Dorothy.\\n“So I’ll just say good-bye.”\\n\\n“Good-bye,” replied the Princess.\\n\\nThey walked carefully through the china country. The little animals and\\nall the people scampered out of their way, fearing the strangers would\\nbreak them, and after an hour or so the travelers reached the other\\nside of the country and came to another china wall.\\n\\nIt was not so high as the first, however, and by standing upon the\\nLion’s back they all managed to scramble to the top. Then the Lion\\ngathered his legs under him and jumped on the wall; but just as he\\njumped, he upset a china church with his tail and smashed it all to\\npieces.\\n\\n“That was too bad,” said Dorothy, “but really I think we were lucky in\\nnot doing these little people more harm than breaking a cow’s leg and a\\nchurch. They are all so brittle!”\\n\\n“They are, indeed,” said the Scarecrow, “and I am thankful I am made of\\nstraw and cannot be easily damaged. There are worse things in the world\\nthan being a Scarecrow.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXI\\nThe Lion Becomes the King of Beasts\\n\\n\\nAfter climbing down from the china wall the travelers found themselves\\nin a disagreeable country, full of bogs and marshes and covered with\\ntall, rank grass. It was difficult to walk without falling into muddy\\nholes, for the grass was so thick that it hid them from sight. However,\\nby carefully picking their way, they got safely along until they\\nreached solid ground. But here the country seemed wilder than ever, and\\nafter a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush they entered\\nanother forest, where the trees were bigger and older than any they had\\never seen.\\n\\n“This forest is perfectly delightful,” declared the Lion, looking\\naround him with joy. “Never have I seen a more beautiful place.”\\n\\n“It seems gloomy,” said the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“Not a bit of it,” answered the Lion. “I should like to live here all\\nmy life. See how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how rich\\nand green the moss is that clings to these old trees. Surely no wild\\nbeast could wish a pleasanter home.”\\n\\n“Perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now,” said Dorothy.\\n\\n“I suppose there are,” returned the Lion, “but I do not see any of them\\nabout.”\\n\\nThey walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any\\nfarther. Dorothy and Toto and the Lion lay down to sleep, while the\\nWoodman and the Scarecrow kept watch over them as usual.\\n\\nWhen morning came, they started again. Before they had gone far they\\nheard a low rumble, as of the growling of many wild animals. Toto\\nwhimpered a little, but none of the others was frightened, and they\\nkept along the well-trodden path until they came to an opening in the\\nwood, in which were gathered hundreds of beasts of every variety. There\\nwere tigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the\\nothers in the natural history, and for a moment Dorothy was afraid. But\\nthe Lion explained that the animals were holding a meeting, and he\\njudged by their snarling and growling that they were in great trouble.\\n\\nAs he spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him, and at once the\\ngreat assemblage hushed as if by magic. The biggest of the tigers came\\nup to the Lion and bowed, saying:\\n\\n“Welcome, O King of Beasts! You have come in good time to fight our\\nenemy and bring peace to all the animals of the forest once more.”\\n\\n“What is your trouble?” asked the Lion quietly.\\n\\n“We are all threatened,” answered the tiger, “by a fierce enemy which\\nhas lately come into this forest. It is a most tremendous monster, like\\na great spider, with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a\\ntree trunk. It has eight of these long legs, and as the monster crawls\\nthrough the forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his\\nmouth, where he eats it as a spider does a fly. Not one of us is safe\\nwhile this fierce creature is alive, and we had called a meeting to\\ndecide how to take care of ourselves when you came among us.”\\n\\nThe Lion thought for a moment.\\n\\n“Are there any other lions in this forest?” he asked.\\n\\n“No; there were some, but the monster has eaten them all. And, besides,\\nthey were none of them nearly so large and brave as you.”\\n\\n“If I put an end to your enemy, will you bow down to me and obey me as\\nKing of the Forest?” inquired the Lion.\\n\\n“We will do that gladly,” returned the tiger; and all the other beasts\\nroared with a mighty roar: “We will!”\\n\\n“Where is this great spider of yours now?” asked the Lion.\\n\\n“Yonder, among the oak trees,” said the tiger, pointing with his\\nforefoot.\\n\\n“Take good care of these friends of mine,” said the Lion, “and I will\\ngo at once to fight the monster.”\\n\\nHe bade his comrades good-bye and marched proudly away to do battle\\nwith the enemy.\\n\\nThe great spider was lying asleep when the Lion found him, and it\\nlooked so ugly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust. Its legs\\nwere quite as long as the tiger had said, and its body covered with\\ncoarse black hair. It had a great mouth, with a row of sharp teeth a\\nfoot long; but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as\\nslender as a wasp’s waist. This gave the Lion a hint of the best way to\\nattack the creature, and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep\\nthan awake, he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the\\nmonster’s back. Then, with one blow of his heavy paw, all armed with\\nsharp claws, he knocked the spider’s head from its body. Jumping down,\\nhe watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling, when he knew it was\\nquite dead.\\n\\nThe Lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were\\nwaiting for him and said proudly:\\n\\n“You need fear your enemy no longer.”\\n\\nThen the beasts bowed down to the Lion as their King, and he promised\\nto come back and rule over them as soon as Dorothy was safely on her\\nway to Kansas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXII\\nThe Country of the Quadlings\\n\\n\\nThe four travelers passed through the rest of the forest in safety, and\\nwhen they came out from its gloom saw before them a steep hill, covered\\nfrom top to bottom with great pieces of rock.\\n\\n“That will be a hard climb,” said the Scarecrow, “but we must get over\\nthe hill, nevertheless.”\\n\\nSo he led the way and the others followed. They had nearly reached the\\nfirst rock when they heard a rough voice cry out, “Keep back!”\\n\\n“Who are you?” asked the Scarecrow.\\n\\nThen a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said, “This\\nhill belongs to us, and we don’t allow anyone to cross it.”\\n\\n“But we must cross it,” said the Scarecrow. “We’re going to the country\\nof the Quadlings.”\\n\\n“But you shall not!” replied the voice, and there stepped from behind\\nthe rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen.\\n\\nHe was quite short and stout and had a big head, which was flat at the\\ntop and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles. But he had no arms\\nat all, and, seeing this, the Scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a\\ncreature could prevent them from climbing the hill. So he said, “I’m\\nsorry not to do as you wish, but we must pass over your hill whether\\nyou like it or not,” and he walked boldly forward.\\n\\nAs quick as lightning the man’s head shot forward and his neck\\nstretched out until the top of the head, where it was flat, struck the\\nScarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling, over and over, down the\\nhill. Almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the body, and\\nthe man laughed harshly as he said, “It isn’t as easy as you think!”\\n\\nA chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other rocks, and Dorothy\\nsaw hundreds of the armless Hammer-Heads upon the hillside, one behind\\nevery rock.\\n\\nThe Lion became quite angry at the laughter caused by the Scarecrow’s\\nmishap, and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder, he dashed up\\nthe hill.\\n\\nAgain a head shot swiftly out, and the great Lion went rolling down the\\nhill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball.\\n\\nDorothy ran down and helped the Scarecrow to his feet, and the Lion\\ncame up to her, feeling rather bruised and sore, and said, “It is\\nuseless to fight people with shooting heads; no one can withstand\\nthem.”\\n\\n“What can we do, then?” she asked.\\n\\n“Call the Winged Monkeys,” suggested the Tin Woodman. “You have still\\nthe right to command them once more.”\\n\\n“Very well,” she answered, and putting on the Golden Cap she uttered\\nthe magic words. The Monkeys were as prompt as ever, and in a few\\nmoments the entire band stood before her.\\n\\n“What are your commands?” inquired the King of the Monkeys, bowing low.\\n\\n“Carry us over the hill to the country of the Quadlings,” answered the\\ngirl.\\n\\n“It shall be done,” said the King, and at once the Winged Monkeys\\ncaught the four travelers and Toto up in their arms and flew away with\\nthem. As they passed over the hill the Hammer-Heads yelled with\\nvexation, and shot their heads high in the air, but they could not\\nreach the Winged Monkeys, which carried Dorothy and her comrades safely\\nover the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the\\nQuadlings.\\n\\n“This is the last time you can summon us,” said the leader to Dorothy;\\n“so good-bye and good luck to you.”\\n\\n“Good-bye, and thank you very much,” returned the girl; and the Monkeys\\nrose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling.\\n\\nThe country of the Quadlings seemed rich and happy. There was field\\nupon field of ripening grain, with well-paved roads running between,\\nand pretty rippling brooks with strong bridges across them. The fences\\nand houses and bridges were all painted bright red, just as they had\\nbeen painted yellow in the country of the Winkies and blue in the\\ncountry of the Munchkins. The Quadlings themselves, who were short and\\nfat and looked chubby and good-natured, were dressed all in red, which\\nshowed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain.\\n\\nThe Monkeys had set them down near a farmhouse, and the four travelers\\nwalked up to it and knocked at the door. It was opened by the farmer’s\\nwife, and when Dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them\\nall a good dinner, with three kinds of cake and four kinds of cookies,\\nand a bowl of milk for Toto.\\n\\n“How far is it to the Castle of Glinda?” asked the child.\\n\\n“It is not a great way,” answered the farmer’s wife. “Take the road to\\nthe South and you will soon reach it.”\\n\\nThanking the good woman, they started afresh and walked by the fields\\nand across the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very\\nbeautiful Castle. Before the gates were three young girls, dressed in\\nhandsome red uniforms trimmed with gold braid; and as Dorothy\\napproached, one of them said to her:\\n\\n“Why have you come to the South Country?”\\n\\n“To see the Good Witch who rules here,” she answered. “Will you take me\\nto her?”\\n\\n“Let me have your name, and I will ask Glinda if she will receive you.”\\nThey told who they were, and the girl soldier went into the Castle.\\nAfter a few moments she came back to say that Dorothy and the others\\nwere to be admitted at once.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXIII\\nGlinda The Good Witch Grants Dorothy’s Wish\\n\\n\\nBefore they went to see Glinda, however, they were taken to a room of\\nthe Castle, where Dorothy washed her face and combed her hair, and the\\nLion shook the dust out of his mane, and the Scarecrow patted himself\\ninto his best shape, and the Woodman polished his tin and oiled his\\njoints.\\n\\nWhen they were all quite presentable they followed the soldier girl\\ninto a big room where the Witch Glinda sat upon a throne of rubies.\\n\\nShe was both beautiful and young to their eyes. Her hair was a rich red\\nin color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders. Her dress was\\npure white but her eyes were blue, and they looked kindly upon the\\nlittle girl.\\n\\n“What can I do for you, my child?” she asked.\\n\\nDorothy told the Witch all her story: how the cyclone had brought her\\nto the Land of Oz, how she had found her companions, and of the\\nwonderful adventures they had met with.\\n\\n“My greatest wish now,” she added, “is to get back to Kansas, for Aunt\\nEm will surely think something dreadful has happened to me, and that\\nwill make her put on mourning; and unless the crops are better this\\nyear than they were last, I am sure Uncle Henry cannot afford it.”\\n\\nGlinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet, upturned face of the loving\\nlittle girl.\\n\\n“Bless your dear heart,” she said, “I am sure I can tell you of a way\\nto get back to Kansas.” Then she added, “But, if I do, you must give me\\nthe Golden Cap.”\\n\\n“Willingly!” exclaimed Dorothy; “indeed, it is of no use to me now, and\\nwhen you have it you can command the Winged Monkeys three times.”\\n\\n“And I think I shall need their service just those three times,”\\nanswered Glinda, smiling.\\n\\nDorothy then gave her the Golden Cap, and the Witch said to the\\nScarecrow, “What will you do when Dorothy has left us?”\\n\\n“I will return to the Emerald City,” he replied, “for Oz has made me\\nits ruler and the people like me. The only thing that worries me is how\\nto cross the hill of the Hammer-Heads.”\\n\\n“By means of the Golden Cap I shall command the Winged Monkeys to carry\\nyou to the gates of the Emerald City,” said Glinda, “for it would be a\\nshame to deprive the people of so wonderful a ruler.”\\n\\n“Am I really wonderful?” asked the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“You are unusual,” replied Glinda.\\n\\nTurning to the Tin Woodman, she asked, “What will become of you when\\nDorothy leaves this country?”\\n\\nHe leaned on his axe and thought a moment. Then he said, “The Winkies\\nwere very kind to me, and wanted me to rule over them after the Wicked\\nWitch died. I am fond of the Winkies, and if I could get back again to\\nthe Country of the West, I should like nothing better than to rule over\\nthem forever.”\\n\\n“My second command to the Winged Monkeys,” said Glinda “will be that\\nthey carry you safely to the land of the Winkies. Your brain may not be\\nso large to look at as those of the Scarecrow, but you are really\\nbrighter than he is—when you are well polished—and I am sure you will\\nrule the Winkies wisely and well.”\\n\\nThen the Witch looked at the big, shaggy Lion and asked, “When Dorothy\\nhas returned to her own home, what will become of you?”\\n\\n“Over the hill of the Hammer-Heads,” he answered, “lies a grand old\\nforest, and all the beasts that live there have made me their King. If\\nI could only get back to this forest, I would pass my life very happily\\nthere.”\\n\\n“My third command to the Winged Monkeys,” said Glinda, “shall be to\\ncarry you to your forest. Then, having used up the powers of the Golden\\nCap, I shall give it to the King of the Monkeys, that he and his band\\nmay thereafter be free for evermore.”\\n\\nThe Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion now thanked the Good\\nWitch earnestly for her kindness; and Dorothy exclaimed:\\n\\n“You are certainly as good as you are beautiful! But you have not yet\\ntold me how to get back to Kansas.”\\n\\n“Your Silver Shoes will carry you over the desert,” replied Glinda. “If\\nyou had known their power you could have gone back to your Aunt Em the\\nvery first day you came to this country.”\\n\\n“But then I should not have had my wonderful brains!” cried the\\nScarecrow. “I might have passed my whole life in the farmer’s\\ncornfield.”\\n\\n“And I should not have had my lovely heart,” said the Tin Woodman. “I\\nmight have stood and rusted in the forest till the end of the world.”\\n\\n“And I should have lived a coward forever,” declared the Lion, “and no\\nbeast in all the forest would have had a good word to say to me.”\\n\\n“This is all true,” said Dorothy, “and I am glad I was of use to these\\ngood friends. But now that each of them has had what he most desired,\\nand each is happy in having a kingdom to rule besides, I think I should\\nlike to go back to Kansas.”\\n\\n“The Silver Shoes,” said the Good Witch, “have wonderful powers. And\\none of the most curious things about them is that they can carry you to\\nany place in the world in three steps, and each step will be made in\\nthe wink of an eye. All you have to do is to knock the heels together\\nthree times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to\\ngo.”\\n\\n“If that is so,” said the child joyfully, “I will ask them to carry me\\nback to Kansas at once.”\\n\\nShe threw her arms around the Lion’s neck and kissed him, patting his\\nbig head tenderly. Then she kissed the Tin Woodman, who was weeping in\\na way most dangerous to his joints. But she hugged the soft, stuffed\\nbody of the Scarecrow in her arms instead of kissing his painted face,\\nand found she was crying herself at this sorrowful parting from her\\nloving comrades.\\n\\nGlinda the Good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little\\ngirl a good-bye kiss, and Dorothy thanked her for all the kindness she\\nhad shown to her friends and herself.\\n\\nDorothy now took Toto up solemnly in her arms, and having said one last\\ngood-bye she clapped the heels of her shoes together three times,\\nsaying:\\n\\n“Take me home to Aunt Em!”\\n\\n\\nInstantly she was whirling through the air, so swiftly that all she\\ncould see or feel was the wind whistling past her ears.\\n\\nThe Silver Shoes took but three steps, and then she stopped so suddenly\\nthat she rolled over upon the grass several times before she knew where\\nshe was.\\n\\nAt length, however, she sat up and looked about her.\\n\\n“Good gracious!” she cried.\\n\\nFor she was sitting on the broad Kansas prairie, and just before her\\nwas the new farmhouse Uncle Henry built after the cyclone had carried\\naway the old one. Uncle Henry was milking the cows in the barnyard, and\\nToto had jumped out of her arms and was running toward the barn,\\nbarking furiously.\\n\\nDorothy stood up and found she was in her stocking-feet. For the Silver\\nShoes had fallen off in her flight through the air, and were lost\\nforever in the desert.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXIV\\nHome Again\\n\\n\\nAunt Em had just come out of the house to water the cabbages when she\\nlooked up and saw Dorothy running toward her.\\n\\n“My darling child!” she cried, folding the little girl in her arms and\\ncovering her face with kisses. “Where in the world did you come from?”\\n\\n“From the Land of Oz,” said Dorothy gravely. “And here is Toto, too.\\nAnd oh, Aunt Em! I’m so glad to be at home again!”\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 55 ***\"}\n",

Bistritz._--Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at\\nVienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an\\nhour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I\\ngot of it from the train and the little I could walk through the\\nstreets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived\\nlate and would start as near the correct time as possible. The\\nimpression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the\\nEast; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is\\nhere of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish\\nrule.\\n\\nWe left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.\\nHere I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or\\nrather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was\\nvery good but thirsty. (_Mem._, get recipe for Mina.) I asked the\\nwaiter, and he said it was called “paprika hendl,” and that, as it was a\\nnational dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the\\nCarpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I\\ndon’t know how I should be able to get on without it.\\n\\nHaving had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the\\nBritish Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library\\nregarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the\\ncountry could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a\\nnobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the\\nextreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states,\\nTransylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian\\nmountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was\\nnot able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the\\nCastle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare\\nwith our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post\\ntown named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter\\nhere some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my\\ntravels with Mina.\\n\\nIn the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:\\nSaxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the\\ndescendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the\\nEast and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended\\nfrom Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered\\nthe country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I\\nread that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the\\nhorseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of\\nimaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (_Mem._, I\\nmust ask the Count all about them.)\\n\\nI did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had\\nall sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my\\nwindow, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been\\nthe paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was\\nstill thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous\\nknocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.\\nI had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour\\nwhich they said was “mamaliga,” and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a\\nvery excellent dish, which they call “impletata.” (_Mem._, get recipe\\nfor this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little\\nbefore eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to\\nthe station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour\\nbefore we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the\\nmore unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?\\n\\nAll day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of\\nbeauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the\\ntop of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by\\nrivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side\\nof them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and\\nrunning strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every\\nstation there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts\\nof attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I\\nsaw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats\\nand home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women\\nlooked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy\\nabout the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other,\\nand most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something\\nfluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there\\nwere petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the\\nSlovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy\\nhats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous\\nheavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass\\nnails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and\\nhad long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very\\npicturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be\\nset down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are,\\nhowever, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural\\nself-assertion.\\n\\nIt was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a\\nvery interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for the\\nBorgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy\\nexistence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series\\nof great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate\\noccasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent\\na siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war\\nproper being assisted by famine and disease.\\n\\nCount Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I\\nfound, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of\\ncourse I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was\\nevidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a\\ncheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white\\nundergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff\\nfitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and\\nsaid, “The Herr Englishman?” “Yes,” I said, “Jonathan Harker.” She\\nsmiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,\\nwho had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with\\na letter:--\\n\\n     “My Friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting\\n     you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will\\n     start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo\\n     Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust\\n     that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you\\n     will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.\\n\\n“Your friend,\\n\\n“DRACULA.”\\n\\n\\n_4 May._--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,\\ndirecting him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on\\nmaking inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and\\npretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be\\ntrue, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he\\nanswered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old\\nlady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of\\nway. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that\\nwas all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could\\ntell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves,\\nand, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak\\nfurther. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask\\nany one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means\\ncomforting.\\n\\nJust before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a\\nvery hysterical way:\\n\\n“Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?” She was in such an excited\\nstate that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and\\nmixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I\\nwas just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her\\nthat I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business,\\nshe asked again:\\n\\n“Do you know what day it is?” I answered that it was the fourth of May.\\nShe shook her head as she said again:\\n\\n“Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?” On\\nmy saying that I did not understand, she went on:\\n\\n“It is the eve of St. George’s Day. Do you not know that to-night, when\\nthe clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have\\nfull sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?”\\nShe was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but\\nwithout effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not\\nto go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very\\nridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business\\nto be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore\\ntried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked\\nher, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and\\ndried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I\\ndid not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been\\ntaught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it\\nseemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a\\nstate of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the\\nrosary round my neck, and said, “For your mother’s sake,” and went out\\nof the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting\\nfor the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still\\nround my neck. Whether it is the old lady’s fear, or the many ghostly\\ntraditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I\\nam not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should\\never reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the\\ncoach!\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_5 May. The Castle._--The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is\\nhigh over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or\\nhills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are\\nmixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake,\\nnaturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put\\ndown, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I\\nleft Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they\\ncalled “robber steak”--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red\\npepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple\\nstyle of the London cat’s meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which\\nproduces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not\\ndisagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.\\n\\nWhen I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him\\ntalking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every\\nnow and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting\\non the bench outside the door--which they call by a name meaning\\n“word-bearer”--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them\\npityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for\\nthere were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot\\ndictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not\\ncheering to me, for amongst them were “Ordog”--Satan, “pokol”--hell,\\n“stregoica”--witch, “vrolok” and “vlkoslak”--both of which mean the same\\nthing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is\\neither were-wolf or vampire. (_Mem._, I must ask the Count about these\\nsuperstitions)\\n\\nWhen we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time\\nswelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and\\npointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a\\nfellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at\\nfirst, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a\\ncharm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me,\\njust starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one\\nseemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I\\ncould not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I\\nhad of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing\\nthemselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of\\nrich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the\\ncentre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered\\nthe whole front of the box-seat--“gotza” they call them--cracked his big\\nwhip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on\\nour journey.\\n\\nI soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the\\nscene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather\\nlanguages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have\\nbeen able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping\\nland full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned\\nwith clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the\\nroad. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple,\\nplum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under\\nthe trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these\\ngreen hills of what they call here the “Mittel Land” ran the road,\\nlosing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the\\nstraggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the\\nhillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we\\nseemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then\\nwhat the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no\\ntime in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime\\nexcellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter\\nsnows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in\\nthe Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept\\nin too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the\\nTurk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops,\\nand so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.\\n\\nBeyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes\\nof forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right\\nand left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon\\nthem and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range,\\ndeep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where\\ngrass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and\\npointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where\\nthe snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the\\nmountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again\\nthe white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as\\nwe swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered\\npeak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to\\nbe right before us:--\\n\\n“Look! Isten szek!”--“God’s seat!”--and he crossed himself reverently.\\n\\nAs we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind\\nus, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was\\nemphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the\\nsunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there\\nwe passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed\\nthat goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses,\\nand as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there\\nwas a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even\\nturn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of\\ndevotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were\\nmany things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here\\nand there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems\\nshining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and\\nagain we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant’s cart--with its\\nlong, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the\\nroad. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming\\npeasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their\\ncoloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long\\nstaves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold,\\nand the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the\\ngloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which\\nran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the\\nPass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of\\nlate-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods\\nthat seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of\\ngreyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a\\npeculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and\\ngrim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset\\nthrew into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the\\nCarpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the\\nhills were so steep that, despite our driver’s haste, the horses could\\nonly go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home,\\nbut the driver would not hear of it. “No, no,” he said; “you must not\\nwalk here; the dogs are too fierce”; and then he added, with what he\\nevidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the\\napproving smile of the rest--“and you may have enough of such matters\\nbefore you go to sleep.” The only stop he would make was a moment’s\\npause to light his lamps.\\n\\nWhen it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the\\npassengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as\\nthough urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully\\nwith his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on\\nto further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of\\npatch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the\\nhills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach\\nrocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a\\nstormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared\\nto fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each\\nside and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One\\nby one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed\\nupon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were\\ncertainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good\\nfaith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of\\nfear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at\\nBistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.\\nThen, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the\\npassengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the\\ndarkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either\\nhappening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would\\ngive me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for\\nsome little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on\\nthe eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the\\nair the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the\\nmountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got\\ninto the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance\\nwhich was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the\\nglare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light\\nwas the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our\\nhard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy\\nroad lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.\\nThe passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock\\nmy own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when\\nthe driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I\\ncould hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I\\nthought it was “An hour less than the time.” Then turning to me, he said\\nin German worse than my own:--\\n\\n“There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will\\nnow come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better\\nthe next day.” Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and\\nsnort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then,\\namongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing\\nof themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook\\nus, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our\\nlamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and\\nsplendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown\\nbeard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I\\ncould only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red\\nin the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:--\\n\\n“You are early to-night, my friend.” The man stammered in reply:--\\n\\n“The English Herr was in a hurry,” to which the stranger replied:--\\n\\n“That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot\\ndeceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift.” As he\\nspoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with\\nvery red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my\\ncompanions whispered to another the line from Burger’s “Lenore”:--\\n\\n    “Denn die Todten reiten schnell”--\\n    (“For the dead travel fast.”)\\n\\nThe strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a\\ngleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time\\nputting out his two fingers and crossing himself. “Give me the Herr’s\\nluggage,” said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were\\nhanded out and put in the calèche. Then I descended from the side of the\\ncoach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a\\nhand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been\\nprodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we\\nswept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam\\nfrom the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected\\nagainst it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then\\nthe driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept\\non their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a\\nstrange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown\\nover my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in\\nexcellent German:--\\n\\n“The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all\\ncare of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the\\ncountry) underneath the seat, if you should require it.” I did not take\\nany, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a\\nlittle strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been\\nany alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that\\nunknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along,\\nthen we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It\\nseemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground\\nagain; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was\\nso. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but\\nI really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any\\nprotest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to\\ndelay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was\\npassing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was\\nwithin a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I\\nsuppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my\\nrecent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.\\n\\nThen a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--a\\nlong, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by\\nanother dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which\\nnow sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed\\nto come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp\\nit through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to\\nstrain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they\\nquieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from\\nsudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each\\nside of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--which\\naffected both the horses and myself in the same way--for I was minded to\\njump from the calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged\\nmadly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them\\nfrom bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to\\nthe sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able\\nto descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and\\nwhispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers\\ndoing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became\\nquite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again\\ntook his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This\\ntime, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a\\nnarrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.\\n\\nSoon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the\\nroadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning\\nrocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we\\ncould hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the\\nrocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.\\nIt grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall,\\nso that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The\\nkeen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew\\nfainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer\\nand nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I\\ngrew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver,\\nhowever, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to\\nleft and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.\\n\\nSuddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The\\ndriver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and,\\njumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know\\nwhat to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while\\nI wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took\\nhis seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep\\nand kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated\\nendlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.\\nOnce the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness\\naround us I could watch the driver’s motions. He went rapidly to where\\nthe blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem\\nto illumine the place around it at all--and gathering a few stones,\\nformed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical\\neffect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it,\\nfor I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but\\nas the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me\\nstraining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue\\nflames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the\\nwolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.\\n\\nAt last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he\\nhad yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse\\nthan ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause\\nfor it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just\\nthen the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the\\njagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw\\naround us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,\\nwith long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more\\nterrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.\\nFor myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man\\nfeels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand\\ntheir true import.\\n\\nAll at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had\\nsome peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and\\nlooked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see;\\nbut the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they\\nhad perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for\\nit seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the\\nring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the\\ncalèche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as\\nto give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know\\nnot, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and\\nlooking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his\\nlong arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves\\nfell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across\\nthe face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.\\n\\nWhen I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche, and the\\nwolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a\\ndreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time\\nseemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete\\ndarkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on\\nascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main\\nalways ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the\\ndriver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a\\nvast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light,\\nand whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit\\nsky.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nJONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL--_continued_\\n\\n\\n_5 May._--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully\\nawake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In\\nthe gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark\\nways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than\\nit really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.\\n\\nWhen the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand\\nto assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious\\nstrength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have\\ncrushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed\\nthem on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and\\nstudded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of\\nmassive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was\\nmassively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and\\nweather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the\\nreins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one\\nof the dark openings.\\n\\nI stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell\\nor knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark\\nwindow openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The\\ntime I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon\\nme. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?\\nWhat sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a\\ncustomary incident in the life of a solicitor’s clerk sent out to\\nexplain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor’s\\nclerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor--for just before leaving\\nLondon I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a\\nfull-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if\\nI were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I\\nexpected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with\\nthe dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt\\nin the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered the\\npinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake\\nand among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to\\nwait the coming of the morning.\\n\\nJust as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching\\nbehind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming\\nlight. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of\\nmassive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise\\nof long disuse, and the great door swung back.\\n\\nWithin, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white\\nmoustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck\\nof colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silver\\nlamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind,\\nthrowing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the\\nopen door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly\\ngesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation:--\\n\\n“Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!” He made no\\nmotion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his\\ngesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, that\\nI had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and\\nholding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince,\\nan effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as\\nice--more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said:--\\n\\n“Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the\\nhappiness you bring!” The strength of the handshake was so much akin to\\nthat which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that\\nfor a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was\\nspeaking; so to make sure, I said interrogatively:--\\n\\n“Count Dracula?” He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:--\\n\\n“I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in;\\nthe night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest.” As he was\\nspeaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out,\\ntook my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. I\\nprotested but he insisted:--\\n\\n“Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not\\navailable. Let me see to your comfort myself.” He insisted on carrying\\nmy traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and\\nalong another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang\\nheavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced\\nto see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper,\\nand on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,\\nflamed and flared.\\n\\nThe Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing\\nthe room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit\\nby a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing\\nthrough this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a\\nwelcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with\\nanother log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were\\nfresh--which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himself\\nleft my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the\\ndoor:--\\n\\n“You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your\\ntoilet. I trust you will find all you wish. When you are ready, come\\ninto the other room, where you will find your supper prepared.”\\n\\nThe light and warmth and the Count’s courteous welcome seemed to have\\ndissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my normal state,\\nI discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty\\ntoilet, I went into the other room.\\n\\nI found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the\\ngreat fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of\\nhis hand to the table, and said:--\\n\\n“I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust, excuse\\nme that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup.”\\n\\nI handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.\\nHe opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed\\nit to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of\\npleasure.\\n\\n“I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant\\nsufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to\\ncome; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in\\nwhom I have every possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energy\\nand talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition. He is\\ndiscreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. He shall\\nbe ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take\\nyour instructions in all matters.”\\n\\nThe Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I\\nfell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese\\nand a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was\\nmy supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many\\nquestions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had\\nexperienced.\\n\\nBy this time I had finished my supper, and by my host’s desire had drawn\\nup a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me,\\nat the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an\\nopportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked\\nphysiognomy.\\n\\nHis face was a strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of the\\nthin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and\\nhair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His\\neyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy\\nhair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I\\ncould see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather\\ncruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over\\nthe lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a\\nman of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops\\nextremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm\\nthough thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.\\n\\nHitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees\\nin the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing\\nthem now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather\\ncoarse--broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in\\nthe centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp\\npoint. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not\\nrepress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a\\nhorrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could\\nnot conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a\\ngrim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his\\nprotuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the\\nfireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the\\nwindow I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a\\nstrange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from\\ndown below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count’s eyes\\ngleamed, and he said:--\\n\\n“Listen to them--the children of the night. What music they make!”\\nSeeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he\\nadded:--\\n\\n“Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the\\nhunter.” Then he rose and said:--\\n\\n“But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you\\nshall sleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the afternoon;\\nso sleep well and dream well!” With a courteous bow, he opened for me\\nhimself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom....\\n\\nI am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things,\\nwhich I dare not confess to my own soul. God keep me, if only for the\\nsake of those dear to me!\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_7 May._--It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the\\nlast twenty-four hours. I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my\\nown accord. When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had\\nsupped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the\\npot being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table, on which\\nwas written:--\\n\\n“I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.--D.” I set to and\\nenjoyed a hearty meal. When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I\\nmight let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one.\\nThere are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the\\nextraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service\\nis of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.\\nThe curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of\\nmy bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have\\nbeen of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old,\\nthough in excellent order. I saw something like them in Hampton Court,\\nbut there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none of\\nthe rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on my\\ntable, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I\\ncould either shave or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a servant\\nanywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.\\nSome time after I had finished my meal--I do not know whether to call it\\nbreakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o’clock when I had\\nit--I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about\\nthe castle until I had asked the Count’s permission. There was\\nabsolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing\\nmaterials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of\\nlibrary. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked.\\n\\nIn the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English\\nbooks, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and\\nnewspapers. A table in the centre was littered with English magazines\\nand newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The books\\nwere of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political\\neconomy, botany, geology, law--all relating to England and English life\\nand customs and manners. There were even such books of reference as the\\nLondon Directory, the “Red” and “Blue” books, Whitaker’s Almanac, the\\nArmy and Navy Lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--the\\nLaw List.\\n\\nWhilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count\\nentered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good\\nnight’s rest. Then he went on:--\\n\\n“I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that\\nwill interest you. These companions”--and he laid his hand on some of\\nthe books--“have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever\\nsince I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours\\nof pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great England; and to\\nknow her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of\\nyour mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of\\nhumanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes\\nit what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books.\\nTo you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak.”\\n\\n“But, Count,” I said, “you know and speak English thoroughly!” He bowed\\ngravely.\\n\\n“I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I\\nfear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I know\\nthe grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them.”\\n\\n“Indeed,” I said, “you speak excellently.”\\n\\n“Not so,” he answered. “Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your\\nLondon, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not\\nenough for me. Here I am noble; I am _boyar_; the common people know me,\\nand I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men\\nknow him not--and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am\\nlike the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his\\nspeaking if he hear my words, ‘Ha, ha! a stranger!’ I have been so long\\nmaster that I would be master still--or at least that none other should\\nbe master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter\\nHawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You\\nshall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may\\nlearn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make\\nerror, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be\\naway so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many\\nimportant affairs in hand.”\\n\\nOf course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might\\ncome into that room when I chose. He answered: “Yes, certainly,” and\\nadded:--\\n\\n“You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are\\nlocked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that\\nall things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with\\nmy knowledge, you would perhaps better understand.” I said I was sure of\\nthis, and then he went on:--\\n\\n“We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are\\nnot your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. Nay, from\\nwhat you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of\\nwhat strange things there may be.”\\n\\nThis led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted to\\ntalk, if only for talking’s sake, I asked him many questions regarding\\nthings that had already happened to me or come within my notice.\\nSometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by\\npretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked most\\nfrankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked\\nhim of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for\\ninstance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue\\nflames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a\\ncertain night of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spirits\\nare supposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any place\\nwhere treasure has been concealed. “That treasure has been hidden,” he\\nwent on, “in the region through which you came last night, there can be\\nbut little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the\\nWallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil\\nin all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men,\\npatriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the\\nAustrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out\\nto meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waited\\ntheir coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep\\ndestruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invader\\nwas triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been\\nsheltered in the friendly soil.”\\n\\n“But how,” said I, “can it have remained so long undiscovered, when\\nthere is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?”\\nThe Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long,\\nsharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:--\\n\\n“Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only\\nappear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if he\\ncan help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he\\nwould not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who\\nmarked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight\\neven for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to\\nfind these places again?”\\n\\n“There you are right,” I said. “I know no more than the dead where even\\nto look for them.” Then we drifted into other matters.\\n\\n“Come,” he said at last, “tell me of London and of the house which you\\nhave procured for me.” With an apology for my remissness, I went into my\\nown room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in\\norder I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I\\npassed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp\\nlit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit\\nin the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa,\\nreading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw’s Guide. When I\\ncame in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I\\nwent into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested in\\neverything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its\\nsurroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the\\nsubject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much\\nmore than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:--\\n\\n“Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there\\nI shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan--nay, pardon me, I\\nfall into my country’s habit of putting your patronymic first--my friend\\nJonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will be\\nin Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my\\nother friend, Peter Hawkins. So!”\\n\\nWe went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at\\nPurfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the\\nnecessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to\\nMr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a\\nplace. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I\\ninscribe here:--\\n\\n“At Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed to\\nbe required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place\\nwas for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure,\\nbuilt of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of\\nyears. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with\\nrust.\\n\\n“The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old _Quatre\\nFace_, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of\\nthe compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by\\nthe solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which\\nmake it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or\\nsmall lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and\\nflows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all\\nperiods back, I should say, to mediæval times, for one part is of stone\\nimmensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with\\niron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or\\nchurch. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading\\nto it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from\\nvarious points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling\\nway, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must\\nbe very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very\\nlarge house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic\\nasylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds.”\\n\\nWhen I had finished, he said:--\\n\\n“I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and to\\nlive in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a\\nday; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoice\\nalso that there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles love\\nnot to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not\\ngaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and\\nsparkling waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer young;\\nand my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not\\nattuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the\\nshadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken\\nbattlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and would\\nbe alone with my thoughts when I may.” Somehow his words and his look\\ndid not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his\\nsmile look malignant and saturnine.\\n\\nPresently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers\\ntogether. He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of\\nthe books around me. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at\\nEngland, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in\\ncertain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed\\nthat one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new\\nestate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the\\nYorkshire coast.\\n\\nIt was the better part of an hour when the Count returned. “Aha!” he\\nsaid; “still at your books? Good! But you must not work always. Come; I\\nam informed that your supper is ready.” He took my arm, and we went into\\nthe next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The\\nCount again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from\\nhome. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate.\\nAfter supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with\\nme, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour\\nafter hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not\\nsay anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host’s wishes in\\nevery way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified\\nme; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at\\nthe coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide.\\nThey say that people who are near death die generally at the change to\\nthe dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and\\ntied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere\\ncan well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up\\nwith preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count\\nDracula, jumping to his feet, said:--\\n\\n“Why, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so\\nlong. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of\\nEngland less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by\\nus,” and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me.\\n\\nI went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to\\nnotice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the\\nwarm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have\\nwritten of this day.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_8 May._--I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too\\ndiffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for\\nthere is something so strange about this place and all in it that I\\ncannot but feel uneasy. I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had\\nnever come. It may be that this strange night-existence is telling on\\nme; but would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to I\\ncould bear it, but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak with,\\nand he!--I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place. Let\\nme be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and\\nimagination must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me say\\nat once how I stand--or seem to.\\n\\nI only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could\\nnot sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window,\\nand was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder,\\nand heard the Count’s voice saying to me, “Good-morning.” I started, for\\nit amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass\\ncovered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly,\\nbut did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count’s\\nsalutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken.\\nThis time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I\\ncould see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in\\nthe mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no\\nsign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on\\nthe top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague\\nfeeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at\\nthe instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was\\ntrickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half\\nround to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his\\neyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at\\nmy throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which\\nheld the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed\\nso quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.\\n\\n“Take care,” he said, “take care how you cut yourself. It is more\\ndangerous than you think in this country.” Then seizing the shaving\\nglass, he went on: “And this is the wretched thing that has done the\\nmischief. It is a foul bauble of man’s vanity. Away with it!” and\\nopening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung\\nout the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones\\nof the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very\\nannoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or\\nthe bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.\\n\\nWhen I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could\\nnot find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that\\nas yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very\\npeculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I\\nwent out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The\\nview was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity\\nof seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A\\nstone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without\\ntouching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree\\ntops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and\\nthere are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through\\nthe forests.\\n\\nBut I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I\\nexplored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and\\nbolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there\\nan available exit.\\n\\nThe castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nJONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL--_continued_\\n\\n\\nWhen I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me.\\nI rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of\\nevery window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my\\nhelplessness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back after a\\nfew hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much\\nas a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to me\\nthat I was helpless I sat down quietly--as quietly as I have ever done\\nanything in my life--and began to think over what was best to be done. I\\nam thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of\\none thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to\\nthe Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it\\nhimself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive\\nme if I trusted him fully with the facts. So far as I can see, my only\\nplan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes\\nopen. I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears,\\nor else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, and\\nshall need, all my brains to get through.\\n\\nI had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below\\nshut, and knew that the Count had returned. He did not come at once into\\nthe library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making\\nthe bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along\\nthought--that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him\\nthrough the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the\\ndining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these\\nmenial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them.\\nThis gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it\\nmust have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that\\nbrought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it\\nmean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his\\nhand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the\\ncoach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the\\ncrucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Bless\\nthat good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a\\ncomfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing\\nwhich I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous\\nshould in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there\\nis something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium,\\na tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some\\ntime, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my\\nmind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count\\nDracula, as it may help me to understand. To-night he may talk of\\nhimself, if I turn the conversation that way. I must be very careful,\\nhowever, not to awake his suspicion.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Midnight._--I have had a long talk with the Count. I asked him a few\\nquestions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject\\nwonderfully. In his speaking of things and people, and especially of\\nbattles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all. This he\\nafterwards explained by saying that to a _boyar_ the pride of his house\\nand name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their\\nfate is his fate. Whenever he spoke of his house he always said “we,”\\nand spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. I wish I could put\\ndown all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most\\nfascinating. It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country. He\\ngrew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great\\nwhite moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as\\nthough he would crush it by main strength. One thing he said which I\\nshall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story of\\nhis race:--\\n\\n“We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood\\nof many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here,\\nin the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from\\nIceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their\\nBerserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay,\\nand of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the\\nwere-wolves themselves had come. Here, too, when they came, they found\\nthe Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame,\\ntill the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those\\nold witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the\\ndesert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as\\nAttila, whose blood is in these veins?” He held up his arms. “Is it a\\nwonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the\\nMagyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his\\nthousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when\\nArpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us\\nhere when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completed\\nthere? And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were\\nclaimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries\\nwas trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay, and more\\nthan that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say,\\n‘water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.’ Who more gladly than we\\nthroughout the Four Nations received the ‘bloody sword,’ or at its\\nwarlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was\\nredeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the\\nflags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who\\nwas it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat\\nthe Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that\\nhis own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the\\nTurk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula,\\nindeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and\\nagain brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who,\\nwhen he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had\\nto come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being\\nslaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! They\\nsaid that he thought only of himself. Bah! what good are peasants\\nwithout a leader? Where ends the war without a brain and heart to\\nconduct it? Again, when, after the battle of Mohács, we threw off the\\nHungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for\\nour spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the\\nSzekelys--and the Dracula as their heart’s blood, their brains, and\\ntheir swords--can boast a record that mushroom growths like the\\nHapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over.\\nBlood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and\\nthe glories of the great races are as a tale that is told.”\\n\\nIt was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed. (_Mem._, this\\ndiary seems horribly like the beginning of the “Arabian Nights,” for\\neverything has to break off at cockcrow--or like the ghost of Hamlet’s\\nfather.)\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_12 May._--Let me begin with facts--bare, meagre facts, verified by\\nbooks and figures, and of which there can be no doubt. I must not\\nconfuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own\\nobservation, or my memory of them. Last evening when the Count came from\\nhis room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the\\ndoing of certain kinds of business. I had spent the day wearily over\\nbooks, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the\\nmatters I had been examining at Lincoln’s Inn. There was a certain\\nmethod in the Count’s inquiries, so I shall try to put them down in\\nsequence; the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.\\n\\nFirst, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. I\\ntold him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not be\\nwise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only\\none could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate\\nagainst his interest. He seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to\\nask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to\\nattend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case\\nlocal help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking\\nsolicitor. I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by any\\nchance mislead him, so he said:--\\n\\n“I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from under\\nthe shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far from\\nLondon, buys for me through your good self my place at London. Good! Now\\nhere let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have\\nsought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one\\nresident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be\\nserved save my wish only; and as one of London residence might, perhaps,\\nhave some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to\\nseek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. Now, suppose\\nI, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, or\\nDurham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with more\\nease be done by consigning to one in these ports?” I answered that\\ncertainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system of\\nagency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on\\ninstruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing\\nhimself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by\\nhim without further trouble.\\n\\n“But,” said he, “I could be at liberty to direct myself. Is it not so?”\\n\\n“Of course,” I replied; and “such is often done by men of business, who\\ndo not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.”\\n\\n“Good!” he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making\\nconsignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of\\ndifficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded\\nagainst. I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability,\\nand he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a\\nwonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or\\nforesee. For a man who was never in the country, and who did not\\nevidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were\\nwonderful. When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had\\nspoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books\\navailable, he suddenly stood up and said:--\\n\\n“Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter\\nHawkins, or to any other?” It was with some bitterness in my heart that\\nI answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of\\nsending letters to anybody.\\n\\n“Then write now, my young friend,” he said, laying a heavy hand on my\\nshoulder: “write to our friend and to any other; and say, if it will\\nplease you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now.”\\n\\n“Do you wish me to stay so long?” I asked, for my heart grew cold at the\\nthought.\\n\\n“I desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal. When your master,\\nemployer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf,\\nit was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. I have not\\nstinted. Is it not so?”\\n\\nWhat could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins’s interest, not\\nmine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while Count\\nDracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing\\nwhich made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I\\ncould have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his\\nmastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but\\nin his own smooth, resistless way:--\\n\\n“I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things\\nother than business in your letters. It will doubtless please your\\nfriends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting\\nhome to them. Is it not so?” As he spoke he handed me three sheets of\\nnote-paper and three envelopes. They were all of the thinnest foreign\\npost, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile,\\nwith the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood\\nas well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, for\\nhe would be able to read it. So I determined to write only formal notes\\nnow, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for\\nto her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he\\ndid see it. When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a\\nbook whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to\\nsome books on his table. Then he took up my two and placed them with his\\nown, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door\\nhad closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which\\nwere face down on the table. I felt no compunction in doing so, for\\nunder the circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way\\nI could.\\n\\nOne of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, The\\nCrescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna; the third was to\\nCoutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth,\\nbankers, Buda-Pesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. I was just\\nabout to look at them when I saw the door-handle move. I sank back in my\\nseat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and\\nto resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter in his\\nhand, entered the room. He took up the letters on the table and stamped\\nthem carefully, and then turning to me, said:--\\n\\n“I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private this\\nevening. You will, I hope, find all things as you wish.” At the door he\\nturned, and after a moment’s pause said:--\\n\\n“Let me advise you, my dear young friend--nay, let me warn you with all\\nseriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any\\nchance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. It is old, and has\\nmany memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. Be\\nwarned! Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then\\nhaste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be\\nsafe. But if you be not careful in this respect, then”--He finished his\\nspeech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were\\nwashing them. I quite understood; my only doubt was as to whether any\\ndream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom\\nand mystery which seemed closing around me.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later._--I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no\\ndoubt in question. I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is\\nnot. I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed--I imagine that\\nmy rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain.\\n\\nWhen he left me I went to my room. After a little while, not hearing any\\nsound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out\\ntowards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse,\\ninaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness\\nof the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in\\nprison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of\\nthe night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me.\\nIt is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all\\nsorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my\\nterrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful\\nexpanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as\\nday. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows\\nin the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed\\nto cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew. As I\\nleaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey\\nbelow me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of\\nthe rooms, that the windows of the Count’s own room would look out. The\\nwindow at which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though\\nweatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many a day since\\nthe case had been there. I drew back behind the stonework, and looked\\ncarefully out.\\n\\nWhat I saw was the Count’s head coming out from the window. I did not\\nsee the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his\\nback and arms. In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had\\nso many opportunities of studying. I was at first interested and\\nsomewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest\\nand amuse a man when he is a prisoner. But my very feelings changed to\\nrepulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the\\nwindow and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss,\\n_face down_ with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. At\\nfirst I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the\\nmoonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could\\nbe no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the\\nstones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus\\nusing every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable\\nspeed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.\\n\\nWhat manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the\\nsemblance of man? I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering\\nme; I am in fear--in awful fear--and there is no escape for me; I am\\nencompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of....\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_15 May._--Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion.\\nHe moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good\\ndeal to the left. He vanished into some hole or window. When his head\\nhad disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without\\navail--the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I\\nknew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to\\nexplore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, and\\ntaking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as I had\\nexpected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the\\nstone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally. I found I could\\npull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the\\ndoor was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count’s\\nroom; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and\\nescape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs\\nand passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. One or two\\nsmall rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in\\nthem except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last,\\nhowever, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it\\nseemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder,\\nand found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came\\nfrom the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door\\nrested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not have\\nagain, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that\\nI could enter. I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right\\nthan the rooms I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I could\\nsee that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the\\nwindows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the latter\\nside, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice. The castle\\nwas built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was\\nquite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or\\nbow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort,\\nimpossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured. To the\\nwest was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged\\nmountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with\\nmountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and\\ncrannies of the stone. This was evidently the portion of the castle\\noccupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of\\ncomfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the\\nyellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to\\nsee even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over\\nall and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. My\\nlamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was\\nglad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place\\nwhich chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better\\nthan living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the\\npresence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I\\nfound a soft quietude come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oak\\ntable where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much\\nthought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my\\ndiary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is\\nnineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my\\nsenses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own\\nwhich mere “modernity” cannot kill.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later: the Morning of 16 May._--God preserve my sanity, for to this I\\nam reduced. Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past.\\nWhilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may not\\ngo mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already. If I be sane, then surely it\\nis maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this\\nhateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me; that to him alone I\\ncan look for safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve his\\npurpose. Great God! merciful God! Let me be calm, for out of that way\\nlies madness indeed. I begin to get new lights on certain things which\\nhave puzzled me. Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant\\nwhen he made Hamlet say:--\\n\\n    “My tablets! quick, my tablets!\\n    ’Tis meet that I put it down,” etc.,\\n\\nfor now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock\\nhad come which must end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose.\\nThe habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me.\\n\\nThe Count’s mysterious warning frightened me at the time; it frightens\\nme more now when I think of it, for in future he has a fearful hold upon\\nme. I shall fear to doubt what he may say!\\n\\nWhen I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and\\npen in my pocket I felt sleepy. The Count’s warning came into my mind,\\nbut I took a pleasure in disobeying it. The sense of sleep was upon me,\\nand with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The soft\\nmoonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom\\nwhich refreshed me. I determined not to return to-night to the\\ngloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat\\nand sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for\\ntheir menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. I drew a great\\ncouch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look\\nat the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for\\nthe dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen\\nasleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly\\nreal--so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the\\nmorning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.\\n\\nI was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I\\ncame into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight,\\nmy own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of\\ndust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by\\ntheir dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming\\nwhen I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw\\nno shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for some\\ntime, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high aquiline\\nnoses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be\\nalmost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was\\nfair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes\\nlike pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it\\nin connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the\\nmoment how or where. All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like\\npearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was something\\nabout them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some\\ndeadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would\\nkiss me with those red lips. It is not good to note this down, lest some\\nday it should meet Mina’s eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth.\\nThey whispered together, and then they all three laughed--such a\\nsilvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have\\ncome through the softness of human lips. It was like the intolerable,\\ntingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by a cunning hand.\\nThe fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her\\non. One said:--\\n\\n“Go on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to\\nbegin.” The other added:--\\n\\n“He is young and strong; there are kisses for us all.” I lay quiet,\\nlooking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.\\nThe fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement\\nof her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent\\nthe same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter\\nunderlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.\\n\\nI was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under\\nthe lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply\\ngloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling\\nand repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips\\nlike an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining\\non the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp\\nteeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of\\nmy mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. Then she\\npaused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked\\nher teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the\\nskin of my throat began to tingle as one’s flesh does when the hand that\\nis to tickle it approaches nearer--nearer. I could feel the soft,\\nshivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat,\\nand the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there.\\nI closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited--waited with beating\\nheart.\\n\\nBut at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as\\nlightning. I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his\\nbeing as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily I\\nsaw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with\\ngiant’s power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the\\nwhite teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with\\npassion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to\\nthe demons of the pit. His eyes were positively blazing. The red light\\nin them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. His\\nface was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires;\\nthe thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar\\nof white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman\\nfrom him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating\\nthem back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the\\nwolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to\\ncut through the air and then ring round the room he said:--\\n\\n“How dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on him when\\nI had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me! Beware\\nhow you meddle with him, or you’ll have to deal with me.” The fair girl,\\nwith a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:--\\n\\n“You yourself never loved; you never love!” On this the other women\\njoined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the\\nroom that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure\\nof fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively,\\nand said in a soft whisper:--\\n\\n“Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it\\nnot so? Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall\\nkiss him at your will. Now go! go! I must awaken him, for there is work\\nto be done.”\\n\\n“Are we to have nothing to-night?” said one of them, with a low laugh,\\nas she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which\\nmoved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer he\\nnodded his head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my\\nears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a\\nhalf-smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with\\nhorror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful\\nbag. There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me\\nwithout my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the\\nmoonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the\\ndim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.\\n\\nThen the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nJONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL--_continued_\\n\\n\\nI awoke in my own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must\\nhave carried me here. I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but\\ncould not arrive at any unquestionable result. To be sure, there were\\ncertain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by\\nin a manner which was not my habit. My watch was still unwound, and I am\\nrigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and\\nmany such details. But these things are no proof, for they may have been\\nevidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or\\nanother, I had certainly been much upset. I must watch for proof. Of one\\nthing I am glad: if it was that the Count carried me here and undressed\\nme, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact. I\\nam sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not\\nhave brooked. He would have taken or destroyed it. As I look round this\\nroom, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort of\\nsanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, who\\nwere--who _are_--waiting to suck my blood.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_18 May._--I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for\\nI _must_ know the truth. When I got to the doorway at the top of the\\nstairs I found it closed. It had been so forcibly driven against the\\njamb that part of the woodwork was splintered. I could see that the bolt\\nof the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside.\\nI fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_19 May._--I am surely in the toils. Last night the Count asked me in\\nthe suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here\\nwas nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days,\\nanother that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the\\nletter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at\\nBistritz. I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state\\nof things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst I\\nam so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to excite his\\nsuspicion and to arouse his anger. He knows that I know too much, and\\nthat I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my only chance is to\\nprolong my opportunities. Something may occur which will give me a\\nchance to escape. I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath\\nwhich was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him. He explained\\nto me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would\\nensure ease of mind to my friends; and he assured me with so much\\nimpressiveness that he would countermand the later letters, which would\\nbe held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my\\nprolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new\\nsuspicion. I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked\\nhim what dates I should put on the letters. He calculated a minute, and\\nthen said:--\\n\\n“The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June\\n29.”\\n\\nI know now the span of my life. God help me!\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_28 May._--There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able to\\nsend word home. A band of Szgany have come to the castle, and are\\nencamped in the courtyard. These Szgany are gipsies; I have notes of\\nthem in my book. They are peculiar to this part of the world, though\\nallied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over. There are thousands\\nof them in Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost outside all law.\\nThey attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or _boyar_, and\\ncall themselves by his name. They are fearless and without religion,\\nsave superstition, and they talk only their own varieties of the Romany\\ntongue.\\n\\nI shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have them\\nposted. I have already spoken them through my window to begin\\nacquaintanceship. They took their hats off and made obeisance and many\\nsigns, which, however, I could not understand any more than I could\\ntheir spoken language....\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nI have written the letters. Mina’s is in shorthand, and I simply ask Mr.\\nHawkins to communicate with her. To her I have explained my situation,\\nbut without the horrors which I may only surmise. It would shock and\\nfrighten her to death were I to expose my heart to her. Should the\\nletters not carry, then the Count shall not yet know my secret or the\\nextent of my knowledge....\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nI have given the letters; I threw them through the bars of my window\\nwith a gold piece, and made what signs I could to have them posted. The\\nman who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed, and then put them\\nin his cap. I could do no more. I stole back to the study, and began to\\nread. As the Count did not come in, I have written here....\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe Count has come. He sat down beside me, and said in his smoothest\\nvoice as he opened two letters:--\\n\\n“The Szgany has given me these, of which, though I know not whence they\\ncome, I shall, of course, take care. See!”--he must have looked at\\nit--“one is from you, and to my friend Peter Hawkins; the other”--here\\nhe caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope, and\\nthe dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly--“the\\nother is a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality! It is\\nnot signed. Well! so it cannot matter to us.” And he calmly held letter\\nand envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed. Then he\\nwent on:--\\n\\n“The letter to Hawkins--that I shall, of course, send on, since it is\\nyours. Your letters are sacred to me. Your pardon, my friend, that\\nunknowingly I did break the seal. Will you not cover it again?” He held\\nout the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean\\nenvelope. I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence. When\\nhe went out of the room I could hear the key turn softly. A minute later\\nI went over and tried it, and the door was locked.\\n\\nWhen, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, his\\ncoming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa. He was very\\ncourteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that I had been\\nsleeping, he said:--\\n\\n“So, my friend, you are tired? Get to bed. There is the surest rest. I\\nmay not have the pleasure to talk to-night, since there are many labours\\nto me; but you will sleep, I pray.” I passed to my room and went to bed,\\nand, strange to say, slept without dreaming. Despair has its own calms.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_31 May._--This morning when I woke I thought I would provide myself\\nwith some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket, so\\nthat I might write in case I should get an opportunity, but again a\\nsurprise, again a shock!\\n\\nEvery scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my memoranda,\\nrelating to railways and travel, my letter of credit, in fact all that\\nmight be useful to me were I once outside the castle. I sat and pondered\\nawhile, and then some thought occurred to me, and I made search of my\\nportmanteau and in the wardrobe where I had placed my clothes.\\n\\nThe suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat and\\nrug; I could find no trace of them anywhere. This looked like some new\\nscheme of villainy....\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_17 June._--This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of my bed\\ncudgelling my brains, I heard without a cracking of whips and pounding\\nand scraping of horses’ feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard.\\nWith joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great\\nleiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of\\neach pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty\\nsheepskin, and high boots. They had also their long staves in hand. I\\nran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the\\nmain hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them. Again a\\nshock: my door was fastened on the outside.\\n\\nThen I ran to the window and cried to them. They looked up at me\\nstupidly and pointed, but just then the “hetman” of the Szgany came out,\\nand seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which they\\nlaughed. Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised\\nentreaty, would make them even look at me. They resolutely turned away.\\nThe leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick\\nrope; these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks\\nhandled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved. When\\nthey were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the\\nyard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on\\nit for luck, lazily went each to his horse’s head. Shortly afterwards, I\\nheard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_24 June, before morning._--Last night the Count left me early, and\\nlocked himself into his own room. As soon as I dared I ran up the\\nwinding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south. I\\nthought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going on.\\nThe Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of\\nsome kind. I know it, for now and then I hear a far-away muffled sound\\nas of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some\\nruthless villainy.\\n\\nI had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw\\nsomething coming out of the Count’s window. I drew back and watched\\ncarefully, and saw the whole man emerge. It was a new shock to me to\\nfind that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst\\ntravelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I\\nhad seen the women take away. There could be no doubt as to his quest,\\nand in my garb, too! This, then, is his new scheme of evil: that he will\\nallow others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leave\\nevidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own\\nletters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local\\npeople be attributed to me.\\n\\nIt makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up\\nhere, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which\\nis even a criminal’s right and consolation.\\n\\nI thought I would watch for the Count’s return, and for a long time sat\\ndoggedly at the window. Then I began to notice that there were some\\nquaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. They were\\nlike the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in\\nclusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a sense of\\nsoothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in the\\nembrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more\\nfully the aërial gambolling.\\n\\nSomething made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far\\nbelow in the valley, which was hidden from my sight. Louder it seemed to\\nring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to\\nthe sound as they danced in the moonlight. I felt myself struggling to\\nawake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was struggling,\\nand my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. I\\nwas becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced the dust; the\\nmoonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom\\nbeyond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom\\nshapes. And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my\\nsenses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were\\nbecoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the\\nthree ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt somewhat\\nsafer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp\\nwas burning brightly.\\n\\nWhen a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the\\nCount’s room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed; and then\\nthere was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With a\\nbeating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison, and\\ncould do nothing. I sat down and simply cried.\\n\\nAs I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without--the agonised cry of a\\nwoman. I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out between\\nthe bars. There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her\\nhands over her heart as one distressed with running. She was leaning\\nagainst a corner of the gateway. When she saw my face at the window she\\nthrew herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace:--\\n\\n“Monster, give me my child!”\\n\\nShe threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the same\\nwords in tones which wrung my heart. Then she tore her hair and beat her\\nbreast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant\\nemotion. Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I could not see\\nher, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door.\\n\\nSomewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of the\\nCount calling in his harsh, metallic whisper. His call seemed to be\\nanswered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. Before many minutes\\nhad passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated,\\nthrough the wide entrance into the courtyard.\\n\\nThere was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but\\nshort. Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.\\n\\nI could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, and\\nshe was better dead.\\n\\nWhat shall I do? what can I do? How can I escape from this dreadful\\nthing of night and gloom and fear?\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_25 June, morning._--No man knows till he has suffered from the night\\nhow sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be. When the\\nsun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great\\ngateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me\\nas if the dove from the ark had lighted there. My fear fell from me as\\nif it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth. I must\\ntake action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me. Last\\nnight one of my post-dated letters went to post, the first of that fatal\\nseries which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the\\nearth.\\n\\nLet me not think of it. Action!\\n\\nIt has always been at night-time that I have been molested or\\nthreatened, or in some way in danger or in fear. I have not yet seen the\\nCount in the daylight. Can it be that he sleeps when others wake, that\\nhe may be awake whilst they sleep? If I could only get into his room!\\nBut there is no possible way. The door is always locked, no way for me.\\n\\nYes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where his body has gone\\nwhy may not another body go? I have seen him myself crawl from his\\nwindow. Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window? The\\nchances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still. I shall risk\\nit. At the worst it can only be death; and a man’s death is not a\\ncalf’s, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me. God help me\\nin my task! Good-bye, Mina, if I fail; good-bye, my faithful friend and\\nsecond father; good-bye, all, and last of all Mina!\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Same day, later._--I have made the effort, and God, helping me, have\\ncome safely back to this room. I must put down every detail in order. I\\nwent whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south\\nside, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs\\naround the building on this side. The stones are big and roughly cut,\\nand the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. I\\ntook off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way. I looked down\\nonce, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would\\nnot overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it. I knew pretty\\nwell the direction and distance of the Count’s window, and made for it\\nas well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available. I did\\nnot feel dizzy--I suppose I was too excited--and the time seemed\\nridiculously short till I found myself standing on the window-sill and\\ntrying to raise up the sash. I was filled with agitation, however, when\\nI bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window. Then I looked\\naround for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery.\\nThe room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things, which\\nseemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same\\nstyle as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I looked\\nfor the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it\\nanywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one\\ncorner--gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and\\nHungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as\\nthough it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was\\nless than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments,\\nsome jewelled, but all of them old and stained.\\n\\nAt one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it, for, since I\\ncould not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which\\nwas the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or\\nall my efforts would be in vain. It was open, and led through a stone\\npassage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I descended,\\nminding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit\\nby loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark,\\ntunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the\\nodour of old earth newly turned. As I went through the passage the smell\\ngrew closer and heavier. At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood\\najar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently\\nbeen used as a graveyard. The roof was broken, and in two places were\\nsteps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and\\nthe earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been\\nbrought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I made search for\\nany further outlet, but there was none. Then I went over every inch of\\nthe ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down even into the\\nvaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to\\nmy very soul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments\\nof old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however, I made a\\ndiscovery.\\n\\nThere, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a\\npile of newly dug earth, lay the Count! He was either dead or asleep, I\\ncould not say which--for the eyes were open and stony, but without the\\nglassiness of death--and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all\\ntheir pallor; the lips were as red as ever. But there was no sign of\\nmovement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart. I bent over him,\\nand tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. He could not have lain\\nthere long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours.\\nBy the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there.\\nI thought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I saw\\nthe dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate,\\nthough unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and\\nleaving the Count’s room by the window, crawled again up the castle\\nwall. Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried\\nto think....\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_29 June._--To-day is the date of my last letter, and the Count has\\ntaken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the\\ncastle by the same window, and in my clothes. As he went down the wall,\\nlizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might\\ndestroy him; but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by man’s hand would\\nhave any effect on him. I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared\\nto see those weird sisters. I came back to the library, and read there\\ntill I fell asleep.\\n\\nI was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can\\nlook as he said:--\\n\\n“To-morrow, my friend, we must part. You return to your beautiful\\nEngland, I to some work which may have such an end that we may never\\nmeet. Your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow I shall not be\\nhere, but all shall be ready for your journey. In the morning come the\\nSzgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some\\nSlovaks. When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall\\nbear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to\\nBistritz. But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle\\nDracula.” I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.\\nSincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in\\nconnection with such a monster, so asked him point-blank:--\\n\\n“Why may I not go to-night?”\\n\\n“Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission.”\\n\\n“But I would walk with pleasure. I want to get away at once.” He smiled,\\nsuch a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was some trick\\nbehind his smoothness. He said:--\\n\\n“And your baggage?”\\n\\n“I do not care about it. I can send for it some other time.”\\n\\nThe Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my\\neyes, it seemed so real:--\\n\\n“You English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is\\nthat which rules our _boyars_: ‘Welcome the coming; speed the parting\\nguest.’ Come with me, my dear young friend. Not an hour shall you wait\\nin my house against your will, though sad am I at your going, and that\\nyou so suddenly desire it. Come!” With a stately gravity, he, with the\\nlamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the hall. Suddenly he\\nstopped.\\n\\n“Hark!”\\n\\nClose at hand came the howling of many wolves. It was almost as if the\\nsound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a great\\norchestra seems to leap under the bâton of the conductor. After a pause\\nof a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back\\nthe ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it\\nopen.\\n\\nTo my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked. Suspiciously, I\\nlooked all round, but could see no key of any kind.\\n\\nAs the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder\\nand angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed\\nfeet as they leaped, came in through the opening door. I knew then that\\nto struggle at the moment against the Count was useless. With such\\nallies as these at his command, I could do nothing. But still the door\\ncontinued slowly to open, and only the Count’s body stood in the gap.\\nSuddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my\\ndoom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation. There\\nwas a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and\\nas a last chance I cried out:--\\n\\n“Shut the door; I shall wait till morning!” and covered my face with my\\nhands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment. With one sweep of his\\npowerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged\\nand echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places.\\n\\nIn silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went\\nto my own room. The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand\\nto me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that\\nJudas in hell might be proud of.\\n\\nWhen I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a\\nwhispering at my door. I went to it softly and listened. Unless my ears\\ndeceived me, I heard the voice of the Count:--\\n\\n“Back, back, to your own place! Your time is not yet come. Wait! Have\\npatience! To-night is mine. To-morrow night is yours!” There was a low,\\nsweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the door, and saw\\nwithout the three terrible women licking their lips. As I appeared they\\nall joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.\\n\\nI came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. It is then so near\\nthe end? To-morrow! to-morrow! Lord, help me, and those to whom I am\\ndear!\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_30 June, morning._--These may be the last words I ever write in this\\ndiary. I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself\\non my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should find me\\nready.\\n\\nAt last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning\\nhad come. Then came the welcome cock-crow, and I felt that I was safe.\\nWith a glad heart, I opened my door and ran down to the hall. I had seen\\nthat the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me. With hands\\nthat trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and drew back the\\nmassive bolts.\\n\\nBut the door would not move. Despair seized me. I pulled, and pulled, at\\nthe door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its\\ncasement. I could see the bolt shot. It had been locked after I left the\\nCount.\\n\\nThen a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I\\ndetermined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count’s\\nroom. He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of\\nevils. Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled\\ndown the wall, as before, into the Count’s room. It was empty, but that\\nwas as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold\\nremained. I went through the door in the corner and down the winding\\nstair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I knew now well\\nenough where to find the monster I sought.\\n\\nThe great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid\\nwas laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their\\nplaces to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, so\\nI raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I saw\\nsomething which filled my very soul with horror. There lay the Count,\\nbut looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair\\nand moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller,\\nand the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than\\never, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the\\ncorners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep,\\nburning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches\\nunderneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature were\\nsimply gorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his\\nrepletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in\\nme revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost. The\\ncoming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those\\nhorrid three. I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the\\nkey. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking smile\\non the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being I\\nwas helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come\\nhe might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and\\ncreate a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the\\nhelpless. The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me\\nto rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand,\\nbut I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the\\ncases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the\\nhateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full\\nupon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to\\nparalyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face,\\nmerely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from my\\nhand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade\\ncaught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid\\nthing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face,\\nblood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its\\nown in the nethermost hell.\\n\\nI thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed\\non fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As I\\nwaited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming\\ncloser, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the\\ncracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had\\nspoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box which\\ncontained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count’s\\nroom, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.\\nWith strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the\\nkey in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There must\\nhave been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of\\nthe locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and\\ndying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned to\\nrun down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance;\\nbut at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the\\ndoor to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from\\nthe lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it was\\nhopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing\\nround me more closely.\\n\\nAs I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet\\nand the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes,\\nwith their freight of earth. There is a sound of hammering; it is the\\nbox being nailed down. Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again\\nalong the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.\\n\\nThe door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is a grinding of the key\\nin the lock; I can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens and\\nshuts; I hear the creaking of lock and bolt.\\n\\nHark! in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels,\\nthe crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass into the\\ndistance.\\n\\nI am alone in the castle with those awful women. Faugh! Mina is a woman,\\nand there is nought in common. They are devils of the Pit!\\n\\nI shall not remain alone with them; I shall try to scale the castle wall\\nfarther than I have yet attempted. I shall take some of the gold with\\nme, lest I want it later. I may find a way from this dreadful place.\\n\\nAnd then away for home! away to the quickest and nearest train! away\\nfrom this cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil and his\\nchildren still walk with earthly feet!\\n\\nAt least God’s mercy is better than that of these monsters, and the\\nprecipice is steep and high. At its foot a man may sleep--as a man.\\nGood-bye, all! Mina!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\n_Letter from Miss Mina Murray to Miss Lucy Westenra._\\n\\n\\n“_9 May._\\n\\n“My dearest Lucy,--\\n\\n“Forgive my long delay in writing, but I have been simply overwhelmed\\nwith work. The life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying.\\nI am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together\\nfreely and build our castles in the air. I have been working very hard\\nlately, because I want to keep up with Jonathan’s studies, and I have\\nbeen practising shorthand very assiduously. When we are married I shall\\nbe able to be useful to Jonathan, and if I can stenograph well enough I\\ncan take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for\\nhim on the typewriter, at which also I am practising very hard. He\\nand I sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is keeping a\\nstenographic journal of his travels abroad. When I am with you I\\nshall keep a diary in the same way. I don’t mean one of those\\ntwo-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-squeezed-in-a-corner diaries, but a\\nsort of journal which I can write in whenever I feel inclined. I do not\\nsuppose there will be much of interest to other people; but it is not\\nintended for them. I may show it to Jonathan some day if there is in it\\nanything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book. I shall try\\nto do what I see lady journalists do: interviewing and writing\\ndescriptions and trying to remember conversations. I am told that, with\\na little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one hears\\nsaid during a day. However, we shall see. I will tell you of my little\\nplans when we meet. I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan\\nfrom Transylvania. He is well, and will be returning in about a week. I\\nam longing to hear all his news. It must be so nice to see strange\\ncountries. I wonder if we--I mean Jonathan and I--shall ever see them\\ntogether. There is the ten o’clock bell ringing. Good-bye.\\n\\n“Your loving\\n\\n“MINA.\\n\\n“Tell me all the news when you write. You have not told me anything for\\na long time. I hear rumours, and especially of a tall, handsome,\\ncurly-haired man???”\\n\\n\\n_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray_.\\n\\n“_17, Chatham Street_,\\n\\n“_Wednesday_.\\n\\n“My dearest Mina,--\\n\\n“I must say you tax me _very_ unfairly with being a bad correspondent. I\\nwrote to you _twice_ since we parted, and your last letter was only your\\n_second_. Besides, I have nothing to tell you. There is really nothing\\nto interest you. Town is very pleasant just now, and we go a good deal\\nto picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park. As to the\\ntall, curly-haired man, I suppose it was the one who was with me at the\\nlast Pop. Some one has evidently been telling tales. That was Mr.\\nHolmwood. He often comes to see us, and he and mamma get on very well\\ntogether; they have so many things to talk about in common. We met some\\ntime ago a man that would just _do for you_, if you were not already\\nengaged to Jonathan. He is an excellent _parti_, being handsome, well\\noff, and of good birth. He is a doctor and really clever. Just fancy! He\\nis only nine-and-twenty, and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under\\nhis own care. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here to\\nsee us, and often comes now. I think he is one of the most resolute men\\nI ever saw, and yet the most calm. He seems absolutely imperturbable. I\\ncan fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients. He has\\na curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to\\nread one’s thoughts. He tries this on very much with me, but I flatter\\nmyself he has got a tough nut to crack. I know that from my glass. Do\\nyou ever try to read your own face? _I do_, and I can tell you it is not\\na bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you\\nhave never tried it. He says that I afford him a curious psychological\\nstudy, and I humbly think I do. I do not, as you know, take sufficient\\ninterest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions. Dress is a\\nbore. That is slang again, but never mind; Arthur says that every day.\\nThere, it is all out. Mina, we have told all our secrets to each other\\nsince we were _children_; we have slept together and eaten together, and\\nlaughed and cried together; and now, though I have spoken, I would like\\nto speak more. Oh, Mina, couldn’t you guess? I love him. I am blushing\\nas I write, for although I _think_ he loves me, he has not told me so in\\nwords. But oh, Mina, I love him; I love him; I love him! There, that\\ndoes me good. I wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire\\nundressing, as we used to sit; and I would try to tell you what I feel.\\nI do not know how I am writing this even to you. I am afraid to stop,\\nor I should tear up the letter, and I don’t want to stop, for I _do_ so\\nwant to tell you all. Let me hear from you _at once_, and tell me all\\nthat you think about it. Mina, I must stop. Good-night. Bless me in your\\nprayers; and, Mina, pray for my happiness.\\n\\n“LUCY.\\n\\n“P.S.--I need not tell you this is a secret. Good-night again.\\n\\n“L.”\\n\\n_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray_.\\n\\n“_24 May_.\\n\\n“My dearest Mina,--\\n\\n“Thanks, and thanks, and thanks again for your sweet letter. It was so\\nnice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy.\\n\\n“My dear, it never rains but it pours. How true the old proverbs are.\\nHere am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet I never had a\\nproposal till to-day, not a real proposal, and to-day I have had three.\\nJust fancy! THREE proposals in one day! Isn’t it awful! I feel sorry,\\nreally and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows. Oh, Mina, I am so\\nhappy that I don’t know what to do with myself. And three proposals!\\nBut, for goodness’ sake, don’t tell any of the girls, or they would be\\ngetting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured\\nand slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at\\nleast. Some girls are so vain! You and I, Mina dear, who are engaged and\\nare going to settle down soon soberly into old married women, can\\ndespise vanity. Well, I must tell you about the three, but you must keep\\nit a secret, dear, from _every one_, except, of course, Jonathan. You\\nwill tell him, because I would, if I were in your place, certainly tell\\nArthur. A woman ought to tell her husband everything--don’t you think\\nso, dear?--and I must be fair. Men like women, certainly their wives, to\\nbe quite as fair as they are; and women, I am afraid, are not always\\nquite as fair as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came just\\nbefore lunch. I told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic-asylum\\nman, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. He was very cool\\noutwardly, but was nervous all the same. He had evidently been schooling\\nhimself as to all sorts of little things, and remembered them; but he\\nalmost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men don’t generally do\\nwhen they are cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept\\nplaying with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. He spoke to\\nme, Mina, very straightforwardly. He told me how dear I was to him,\\nthough he had known me so little, and what his life would be with me to\\nhelp and cheer him. He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if I\\ndid not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said that he was a brute\\nand would not add to my present trouble. Then he broke off and asked if\\nI could love him in time; and when I shook my head his hands trembled,\\nand then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one\\nelse. He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring my\\nconfidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman’s heart was\\nfree a man might have hope. And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to\\ntell him that there was some one. I only told him that much, and then he\\nstood up, and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my\\nhands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and that if I ever\\nwanted a friend I must count him one of my best. Oh, Mina dear, I can’t\\nhelp crying: and you must excuse this letter being all blotted. Being\\nproposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn’t at\\nall a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow, whom you know\\nloves you honestly, going away and looking all broken-hearted, and to\\nknow that, no matter what he may say at the moment, you are passing\\nquite out of his life. My dear, I must stop here at present, I feel so\\nmiserable, though I am so happy.\\n\\n“_Evening._\\n\\n“Arthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I left\\noff, so I can go on telling you about the day. Well, my dear, number Two\\ncame after lunch. He is such a nice fellow, an American from Texas, and\\nhe looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he\\nhas been to so many places and has had such adventures. I sympathise\\nwith poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her\\near, even by a black man. I suppose that we women are such cowards that\\nwe think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him. I know now\\nwhat I would do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me. No, I\\ndon’t, for there was Mr. Morris telling us his stories, and Arthur never\\ntold any, and yet---- My dear, I am somewhat previous. Mr. Quincey P.\\nMorris found me alone. It seems that a man always does find a girl\\nalone. No, he doesn’t, for Arthur tried twice to _make_ a chance, and I\\nhelping him all I could; I am not ashamed to say it now. I must tell you\\nbeforehand that Mr. Morris doesn’t always speak slang--that is to say,\\nhe never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really well\\neducated and has exquisite manners--but he found out that it amused me\\nto hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and there\\nwas no one to be shocked, he said such funny things. I am afraid, my\\ndear, he has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever else he\\nhas to say. But this is a way slang has. I do not know myself if I shall\\never speak slang; I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I have never\\nheard him use any as yet. Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked\\nas happy and jolly as he could, but I could see all the same that he was\\nvery nervous. He took my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly:--\\n\\n“‘Miss Lucy, I know I ain’t good enough to regulate the fixin’s of your\\nlittle shoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is you\\nwill go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit. Won’t\\nyou just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road\\ntogether, driving in double harness?’\\n\\n“Well, he did look so good-humoured and so jolly that it didn’t seem\\nhalf so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward; so I said, as\\nlightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and that I\\nwasn’t broken to harness at all yet. Then he said that he had spoken in\\na light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so\\non so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, I would forgive him. He\\nreally did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn’t help\\nfeeling a bit serious too--I know, Mina, you will think me a horrid\\nflirt--though I couldn’t help feeling a sort of exultation that he was\\nnumber two in one day. And then, my dear, before I could say a word he\\nbegan pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very\\nheart and soul at my feet. He looked so earnest over it that I shall\\nnever again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest,\\nbecause he is merry at times. I suppose he saw something in my face\\nwhich checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of\\nmanly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free:--\\n\\n“‘Lucy, you are an honest-hearted girl, I know. I should not be here\\nspeaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit, right\\nthrough to the very depths of your soul. Tell me, like one good fellow\\nto another, is there any one else that you care for? And if there is\\nI’ll never trouble you a hair’s breadth again, but will be, if you will\\nlet me, a very faithful friend.’\\n\\n“My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy\\nof them? Here was I almost making fun of this great-hearted, true\\ngentleman. I burst into tears--I am afraid, my dear, you will think\\nthis a very sloppy letter in more ways than one--and I really felt very\\nbadly. Why can’t they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want\\nher, and save all this trouble? But this is heresy, and I must not say\\nit. I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able to look into\\nMr. Morris’s brave eyes, and I told him out straight:--\\n\\n“‘Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that he\\neven loves me.’ I was right to speak to him so frankly, for quite a\\nlight came into his face, and he put out both his hands and took mine--I\\nthink I put them into his--and said in a hearty way:--\\n\\n“‘That’s my brave girl. It’s better worth being late for a chance of\\nwinning you than being in time for any other girl in the world. Don’t\\ncry, my dear. If it’s for me, I’m a hard nut to crack; and I take it\\nstanding up. If that other fellow doesn’t know his happiness, well, he’d\\nbetter look for it soon, or he’ll have to deal with me. Little girl,\\nyour honesty and pluck have made me a friend, and that’s rarer than a\\nlover; it’s more unselfish anyhow. My dear, I’m going to have a pretty\\nlonely walk between this and Kingdom Come. Won’t you give me one kiss?\\nIt’ll be something to keep off the darkness now and then. You can, you\\nknow, if you like, for that other good fellow--he must be a good fellow,\\nmy dear, and a fine fellow, or you could not love him--hasn’t spoken\\nyet.’ That quite won me, Mina, for it _was_ brave and sweet of him, and\\nnoble, too, to a rival--wasn’t it?--and he so sad; so I leant over and\\nkissed him. He stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked down\\ninto my face--I am afraid I was blushing very much--he said:--\\n\\n“‘Little girl, I hold your hand, and you’ve kissed me, and if these\\nthings don’t make us friends nothing ever will. Thank you for your sweet\\nhonesty to me, and good-bye.’ He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat,\\nwent straight out of the room without looking back, without a tear or a\\nquiver or a pause; and I am crying like a baby. Oh, why must a man like\\nthat be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would\\nworship the very ground he trod on? I know I would if I were free--only\\nI don’t want to be free. My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel I\\ncannot write of happiness just at once, after telling you of it; and I\\ndon’t wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy.\\n\\n“Ever your loving\\n\\n“LUCY.\\n\\n“P.S.--Oh, about number Three--I needn’t tell you of number Three, need\\nI? Besides, it was all so confused; it seemed only a moment from his\\ncoming into the room till both his arms were round me, and he was\\nkissing me. I am very, very happy, and I don’t know what I have done to\\ndeserve it. I must only try in the future to show that I am not\\nungrateful to God for all His goodness to me in sending to me such a\\nlover, such a husband, and such a friend.\\n\\n“Good-bye.”\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n(Kept in phonograph)\\n\\n_25 May._--Ebb tide in appetite to-day.

To-day I seemed to get\\nnearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery.\\n\\nI questioned him more fully than I had ever done, with a view to making\\nmyself master of the facts of his hallucination.

Whitby._--Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and\\nlovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in\\nwhich they have rooms. This is a lovely place. The little river, the\\nEsk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the\\nharbour. A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the\\nview seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley is\\nbeautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land\\non either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to\\nsee down. The houses of the old town--the side away from us--are all\\nred-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the\\npictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby\\nAbbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of\\n“Marmion,” where the girl was built up in the wall. It is a most noble\\nruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is\\na legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows. Between it and\\nthe town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big\\ngraveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot in\\nWhitby, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of the\\nharbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness\\nstretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that\\npart of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been\\ndestroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches\\nout over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats beside\\nthem, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long\\nlooking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and\\nsit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with my\\nbook on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are\\nsitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and\\ntalk.\\n\\nThe harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall\\nstretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in\\nthe middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs along outside\\nof it. On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely,\\nand its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers there is a\\nnarrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.\\n\\nIt is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to\\nnothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between\\nbanks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this\\nside there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of\\nwhich runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end of\\nit is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a\\nmournful sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship is\\nlost bells are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about this; he\\nis coming this way....\\n\\nHe is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his face is all\\ngnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree. He tells me that he is\\nnearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing\\nfleet when Waterloo was fought. He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical\\nperson, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady\\nat the abbey he said very brusquely:--\\n\\n“I wouldn’t fash masel’ about them, miss. Them things be all wore out.\\nMind, I don’t say that they never was, but I do say that they wasn’t in\\nmy time. They be all very well for comers and trippers, an’ the like,\\nbut not for a nice young lady like you. Them feet-folks from York and\\nLeeds that be always eatin’ cured herrin’s an’ drinkin’ tea an’ lookin’\\nout to buy cheap jet would creed aught. I wonder masel’ who’d be\\nbothered tellin’ lies to them--even the newspapers, which is full of\\nfool-talk.” I thought he would be a good person to learn interesting\\nthings from, so I asked him if he would mind telling me something about\\nthe whale-fishing in the old days. He was just settling himself to begin\\nwhen the clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and said:--\\n\\n“I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. My grand-daughter doesn’t like\\nto be kept waitin’ when the tea is ready, for it takes me time to\\ncrammle aboon the grees, for there be a many of ’em; an’, miss, I lack\\nbelly-timber sairly by the clock.”\\n\\nHe hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could, down\\nthe steps. The steps are a great feature on the place. They lead from\\nthe town up to the church, there are hundreds of them--I do not know how\\nmany--and they wind up in a delicate curve; the slope is so gentle that\\na horse could easily walk up and down them. I think they must originally\\nhave had something to do with the abbey. I shall go home too. Lucy went\\nout visiting with her mother, and as they were only duty calls, I did\\nnot go. They will be home by this.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_1 August._--I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and we had a most\\ninteresting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come\\nand join him. He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them, and I should think\\nmust have been in his time a most dictatorial person. He will not admit\\nanything, and downfaces everybody. If he can’t out-argue them he bullies\\nthem, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views. Lucy\\nwas looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock; she has got a\\nbeautiful colour since she has been here. I noticed that the old men did\\nnot lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down.\\nShe is so sweet with old people; I think they all fell in love with her\\non the spot. Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her, but\\ngave me double share instead. I got him on the subject of the legends,\\nand he went off at once into a sort of sermon. I must try to remember it\\nand put it down:--\\n\\n“It be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel; that’s what it be, an’\\nnowt else. These bans an’ wafts an’ boh-ghosts an’ barguests an’ bogles\\nan’ all anent them is only fit to set bairns an’ dizzy women\\na-belderin’. They be nowt but air-blebs. They, an’ all grims an’ signs\\nan’ warnin’s, be all invented by parsons an’ illsome beuk-bodies an’\\nrailway touters to skeer an’ scunner hafflin’s, an’ to get folks to do\\nsomethin’ that they don’t other incline to. It makes me ireful to think\\no’ them. Why, it’s them that, not content with printin’ lies on paper\\nan’ preachin’ them out of pulpits, does want to be cuttin’ them on the\\ntombstones. Look here all around you in what airt ye will; all them\\nsteans, holdin’ up their heads as well as they can out of their pride,\\nis acant--simply tumblin’ down with the weight o’ the lies wrote on\\nthem, ‘Here lies the body’ or ‘Sacred to the memory’ wrote on all of\\nthem, an’ yet in nigh half of them there bean’t no bodies at all; an’\\nthe memories of them bean’t cared a pinch of snuff about, much less\\nsacred. Lies all of them, nothin’ but lies of one kind or another! My\\ngog, but it’ll be a quare scowderment at the Day of Judgment when they\\ncome tumblin’ up in their death-sarks, all jouped together an’ tryin’ to\\ndrag their tombsteans with them to prove how good they was; some of them\\ntrimmlin’ and ditherin’, with their hands that dozzened an’ slippy from\\nlyin’ in the sea that they can’t even keep their grup o’ them.”\\n\\nI could see from the old fellow’s self-satisfied air and the way in\\nwhich he looked round for the approval of his cronies that he was\\n“showing off,” so I put in a word to keep him going:--\\n\\n“Oh, Mr. Swales, you can’t be serious. Surely these tombstones are not\\nall wrong?”\\n\\n“Yabblins! There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin’ where they make\\nout the people too good; for there be folk that do think a balm-bowl be\\nlike the sea, if only it be their own. The whole thing be only lies. Now\\nlook you here; you come here a stranger, an’ you see this kirk-garth.” I\\nnodded, for I thought it better to assent, though I did not quite\\nunderstand his dialect. I knew it had something to do with the church.\\nHe went on: “And you consate that all these steans be aboon folk that be\\nhapped here, snod an’ snog?” I assented again. “Then that be just where\\nthe lie comes in. Why, there be scores of these lay-beds that be toom as\\nold Dun’s ’bacca-box on Friday night.” He nudged one of his companions,\\nand they all laughed. “And my gog! how could they be otherwise? Look at\\nthat one, the aftest abaft the bier-bank: read it!” I went over and\\nread:--\\n\\n“Edward Spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by pirates off the coast of\\nAndres, April, 1854, æt. 30.” When I came back Mr. Swales went on:--\\n\\n“Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here? Murdered off the coast\\nof Andres! an’ you consated his body lay under! Why, I could name ye a\\ndozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above”--he pointed\\nnorthwards--“or where the currents may have drifted them. There be the\\nsteans around ye. Ye can, with your young eyes, read the small-print of\\nthe lies from here. This Braithwaite Lowrey--I knew his father, lost in\\nthe _Lively_ off Greenland in ’20; or Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the\\nsame seas in 1777; or John Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year\\nlater; or old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned\\nin the Gulf of Finland in ’50. Do ye think that all these men will have\\nto make a rush to Whitby when the trumpet sounds? I have me antherums\\naboot it! I tell ye that when they got here they’d be jommlin’ an’\\njostlin’ one another that way that it ’ud be like a fight up on the ice\\nin the old days, when we’d be at one another from daylight to dark, an’\\ntryin’ to tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis.” This was\\nevidently local pleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and his\\ncronies joined in with gusto.\\n\\n“But,” I said, “surely you are not quite correct, for you start on the\\nassumption that all the poor people, or their spirits, will have to\\ntake their tombstones with them on the Day of Judgment. Do you think\\nthat will be really necessary?”\\n\\n“Well, what else be they tombstones for? Answer me that, miss!”\\n\\n“To please their relatives, I suppose.”\\n\\n“To please their relatives, you suppose!” This he said with intense\\nscorn. “How will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote\\nover them, and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies?” He\\npointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab, on\\nwhich the seat was rested, close to the edge of the cliff. “Read the\\nlies on that thruff-stean,” he said. The letters were upside down to me\\nfrom where I sat, but Lucy was more opposite to them, so she leant over\\nand read:--\\n\\n“Sacred to the memory of George Canon, who died, in the hope of a\\nglorious resurrection, on July, 29, 1873, falling from the rocks at\\nKettleness. This tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly\\nbeloved son. ‘He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.’\\nReally, Mr. Swales, I don’t see anything very funny in that!” She spoke\\nher comment very gravely and somewhat severely.\\n\\n“Ye don’t see aught funny! Ha! ha! But that’s because ye don’t gawm the\\nsorrowin’ mother was a hell-cat that hated him because he was\\nacrewk’d--a regular lamiter he was--an’ he hated her so that he\\ncommitted suicide in order that she mightn’t get an insurance she put on\\nhis life. He blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket that\\nthey had for scarin’ the crows with. ’Twarn’t for crows then, for it\\nbrought the clegs and the dowps to him. That’s the way he fell off the\\nrocks. And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I’ve often heard him\\nsay masel’ that he hoped he’d go to hell, for his mother was so pious\\nthat she’d be sure to go to heaven, an’ he didn’t want to addle where\\nshe was. Now isn’t that stean at any rate”--he hammered it with his\\nstick as he spoke--“a pack of lies? and won’t it make Gabriel keckle\\nwhen Geordie comes pantin’ up the grees with the tombstean balanced on\\nhis hump, and asks it to be took as evidence!”\\n\\nI did not know what to say, but Lucy turned the conversation as she\\nsaid, rising up:--\\n\\n“Oh, why did you tell us of this? It is my favourite seat, and I cannot\\nleave it; and now I find I must go on sitting over the grave of a\\nsuicide.”\\n\\n“That won’t harm ye, my pretty; an’ it may make poor Geordie gladsome to\\nhave so trim a lass sittin’ on his lap. That won’t hurt ye. Why, I’ve\\nsat here off an’ on for nigh twenty years past, an’ it hasn’t done me\\nno harm. Don’t ye fash about them as lies under ye, or that doesn’ lie\\nthere either! It’ll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye see the\\ntombsteans all run away with, and the place as bare as a stubble-field.\\nThere’s the clock, an’ I must gang. My service to ye, ladies!” And off\\nhe hobbled.\\n\\nLucy and I sat awhile, and it was all so beautiful before us that we\\ntook hands as we sat; and she told me all over again about Arthur and\\ntheir coming marriage. That made me just a little heart-sick, for I\\nhaven’t heard from Jonathan for a whole month.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_The same day._ I came up here alone, for I am very sad. There was no\\nletter for me. I hope there cannot be anything the matter with Jonathan.\\nThe clock has just struck nine. I see the lights scattered all over the\\ntown, sometimes in rows where the streets are, and sometimes singly;\\nthey run right up the Esk and die away in the curve of the valley. To my\\nleft the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house next\\nthe abbey. The sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behind\\nme, and there is a clatter of a donkey’s hoofs up the paved road below.\\nThe band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz in good time, and further\\nalong the quay there is a Salvation Army meeting in a back street.\\nNeither of the bands hears the other, but up here I hear and see them\\nboth. I wonder where Jonathan is and if he is thinking of me! I wish he\\nwere here.\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n_5 June._--The case of Renfield grows more interesting the more I get to\\nunderstand the man. He has certain qualities very largely developed;\\nselfishness, secrecy, and purpose. I wish I could get at what is the\\nobject of the latter. He seems to have some settled scheme of his own,\\nbut what it is I do not yet know. His redeeming quality is a love of\\nanimals, though, indeed, he has such curious turns in it that I\\nsometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel. His pets are of odd\\nsorts. Just now his hobby is catching flies. He has at present such a\\nquantity that I have had myself to expostulate. To my astonishment, he\\ndid not break out into a fury, as I expected, but took the matter in\\nsimple seriousness. He thought for a moment, and then said: “May I have\\nthree days? I shall clear them away.” Of course, I said that would do. I\\nmust watch him.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_18 June._--He has turned his mind now to spiders, and has got several\\nvery big fellows in a box. He keeps feeding them with his flies, and\\nthe number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished, although he\\nhas used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his\\nroom.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_1 July._--His spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his\\nflies, and to-day I told him that he must get rid of them. He looked\\nvery sad at this, so I said that he must clear out some of them, at all\\nevents. He cheerfully acquiesced in this, and I gave him the same time\\nas before for reduction. He disgusted me much while with him, for when a\\nhorrid blow-fly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room,\\nhe caught it, held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger\\nand thumb, and, before I knew what he was going to do, put it in his\\nmouth and ate it. I scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that it\\nwas very good and very wholesome; that it was life, strong life, and\\ngave life to him. This gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one. I must\\nwatch how he gets rid of his spiders. He has evidently some deep problem\\nin his mind, for he keeps a little note-book in which he is always\\njotting down something. Whole pages of it are filled with masses of\\nfigures, generally single numbers added up in batches, and then the\\ntotals added in batches again, as though he were “focussing” some\\naccount, as the auditors put it.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_8 July._--There is a method in his madness, and the rudimentary idea in\\nmy mind is growing. It will be a whole idea soon, and then, oh,\\nunconscious cerebration! you will have to give the wall to your\\nconscious brother. I kept away from my friend for a few days, so that I\\nmight notice if there were any change. Things remain as they were except\\nthat he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one. He has\\nmanaged to get a sparrow, and has already partially tamed it. His means\\nof taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminished. Those that\\ndo remain, however, are well fed, for he still brings in the flies by\\ntempting them with his food.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_19 July._--We are progressing. My friend has now a whole colony of\\nsparrows, and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated. When I came\\nin he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favour--a very,\\nvery great favour; and as he spoke he fawned on me like a dog. I asked\\nhim what it was, and he said, with a sort of rapture in his voice and\\nbearing:--\\n\\n“A kitten, a nice little, sleek playful kitten, that I can play with,\\nand teach, and feed--and feed--and feed!” I was not unprepared for this\\nrequest, for I had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and\\nvivacity, but I did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows\\nshould be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders; so\\nI said I would see about it, and asked him if he would not rather have a\\ncat than a kitten. His eagerness betrayed him as he answered:--\\n\\n“Oh, yes, I would like a cat! I only asked for a kitten lest you should\\nrefuse me a cat. No one would refuse me a kitten, would they?” I shook\\nmy head, and said that at present I feared it would not be possible, but\\nthat I would see about it. His face fell, and I could see a warning of\\ndanger in it, for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant\\nkilling. The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac. I shall test him\\nwith his present craving and see how it will work out; then I shall know\\nmore.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_10 p. m._--I have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner\\nbrooding. When I came in he threw himself on his knees before me and\\nimplored me to let him have a cat; that his salvation depended upon it.\\nI was firm, however, and told him that he could not have it, whereupon\\nhe went without a word, and sat down, gnawing his fingers, in the corner\\nwhere I had found him. I shall see him in the morning early.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_20 July._--Visited Renfield very early, before the attendant went his\\nrounds. Found him up and humming a tune. He was spreading out his sugar,\\nwhich he had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning his\\nfly-catching again; and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace. I\\nlooked around for his birds, and not seeing them, asked him where they\\nwere. He replied, without turning round, that they had all flown away.\\nThere were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of\\nblood. I said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report to me if\\nthere were anything odd about him during the day.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_11 a. m._--The attendant has just been to me to say that Renfield has\\nbeen very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers. “My belief is,\\ndoctor,” he said, “that he has eaten his birds, and that he just took\\nand ate them raw!”\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_11 p. m._--I gave Renfield a strong opiate to-night, enough to make\\neven him sleep, and took away his pocket-book to look at it. The thought\\nthat has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theory\\nproved. My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. I shall have to\\ninvent a new classification for him, and call him a zoöphagous\\n(life-eating) maniac; what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he\\ncan, and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way. He\\ngave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird, and then\\nwanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would have been his later\\nsteps? It would almost be worth while to complete the experiment. It\\nmight be done if there were only a sufficient cause. Men sneered at\\nvivisection, and yet look at its results to-day! Why not advance science\\nin its most difficult and vital aspect--the knowledge of the brain? Had\\nI even the secret of one such mind--did I hold the key to the fancy of\\neven one lunatic--I might advance my own branch of science to a pitch\\ncompared with which Burdon-Sanderson’s physiology or Ferrier’s\\nbrain-knowledge would be as nothing. If only there were a sufficient\\ncause! I must not think too much of this, or I may be tempted; a good\\ncause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of an\\nexceptional brain, congenitally?\\n\\nHow well the man reasoned; lunatics always do within their own scope. I\\nwonder at how many lives he values a man, or if at only one. He has\\nclosed the account most accurately, and to-day begun a new record. How\\nmany of us begin a new record with each day of our lives?\\n\\nTo me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope,\\nand that truly I began a new record. So it will be until the Great\\nRecorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance to\\nprofit or loss. Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I be\\nangry with my friend whose happiness is yours; but I must only wait on\\nhopeless and work. Work! work!\\n\\nIf I only could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend there--a\\ngood, unselfish cause to make me work--that would be indeed happiness.\\n\\n\\n_Mina Murray’s Journal._\\n\\n_26 July._--I am anxious, and it soothes me to express myself here; it\\nis like whispering to one’s self and listening at the same time. And\\nthere is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it\\ndifferent from writing. I am unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan. I\\nhad not heard from Jonathan for some time, and was very concerned; but\\nyesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter from\\nhim. I had written asking him if he had heard, and he said the enclosed\\nhad just been received. It is only a line dated from Castle Dracula,\\nand says that he is just starting for home. That is not like Jonathan;\\nI do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy. Then, too, Lucy,\\nalthough she is so well, has lately taken to her old habit of walking in\\nher sleep. Her mother has spoken to me about it, and we have decided\\nthat I am to lock the door of our room every night. Mrs. Westenra has\\ngot an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on roofs of houses and\\nalong the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over\\nwith a despairing cry that echoes all over the place. Poor dear, she is\\nnaturally anxious about Lucy, and she tells me that her husband, Lucy’s\\nfather, had the same habit; that he would get up in the night and dress\\nhimself and go out, if he were not stopped. Lucy is to be married in the\\nautumn, and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is\\nto be arranged. I sympathise with her, for I do the same, only Jonathan\\nand I will start in life in a very simple way, and shall have to try to\\nmake both ends meet. Mr. Holmwood--he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only\\nson of Lord Godalming--is coming up here very shortly--as soon as he can\\nleave town, for his father is not very well, and I think dear Lucy is\\ncounting the moments till he comes. She wants to take him up to the seat\\non the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of Whitby. I daresay it\\nis the waiting which disturbs her; she will be all right when he\\narrives.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_27 July._--No news from Jonathan. I am getting quite uneasy about him,\\nthough why I should I do not know; but I do wish that he would write, if\\nit were only a single line. Lucy walks more than ever, and each night I\\nam awakened by her moving about the room. Fortunately, the weather is so\\nhot that she cannot get cold; but still the anxiety and the perpetually\\nbeing wakened is beginning to tell on me, and I am getting nervous and\\nwakeful myself. Thank God, Lucy’s health keeps up. Mr. Holmwood has been\\nsuddenly called to Ring to see his father, who has been taken seriously\\nill. Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, but it does not touch\\nher looks; she is a trifle stouter, and her cheeks are a lovely\\nrose-pink. She has lost that anæmic look which she had. I pray it will\\nall last.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_3 August._--Another week gone, and no news from Jonathan, not even to\\nMr. Hawkins, from whom I have heard. Oh, I do hope he is not ill. He\\nsurely would have written. I look at that last letter of his, but\\nsomehow it does not satisfy me. It does not read like him, and yet it is\\nhis writing. There is no mistake of that. Lucy has not walked much in\\nher sleep the last week, but there is an odd concentration about her\\nwhich I do not understand; even in her sleep she seems to be watching\\nme. She tries the door, and finding it locked, goes about the room\\nsearching for the key.\\n\\n_6 August._--Another three days, and no news. This suspense is getting\\ndreadful. If I only knew where to write to or where to go to, I should\\nfeel easier; but no one has heard a word of Jonathan since that last\\nletter. I must only pray to God for patience. Lucy is more excitable\\nthan ever, but is otherwise well. Last night was very threatening, and\\nthe fishermen say that we are in for a storm. I must try to watch it and\\nlearn the weather signs. To-day is a grey day, and the sun as I write is\\nhidden in thick clouds, high over Kettleness. Everything is grey--except\\nthe green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it; grey earthy rock;\\ngrey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the\\ngrey sea, into which the sand-points stretch like grey fingers. The sea\\nis tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar,\\nmuffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a grey\\nmist. All is vastness; the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and\\nthere is a “brool” over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom.\\nDark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in\\nthe mist, and seem “men like trees walking.” The fishing-boats are\\nracing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into\\nthe harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old Mr. Swales. He is\\nmaking straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that\\nhe wants to talk....\\n\\nI have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man. When he sat\\ndown beside me, he said in a very gentle way:--\\n\\n“I want to say something to you, miss.” I could see he was not at ease,\\nso I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak\\nfully; so he said, leaving his hand in mine:--\\n\\n“I’m afraid, my deary, that I must have shocked you by all the wicked\\nthings I’ve been sayin’ about the dead, and such like, for weeks past;\\nbut I didn’t mean them, and I want ye to remember that when I’m gone. We\\naud folks that be daffled, and with one foot abaft the krok-hooal, don’t\\naltogether like to think of it, and we don’t want to feel scart of it;\\nan’ that’s why I’ve took to makin’ light of it, so that I’d cheer up my\\nown heart a bit. But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain’t afraid of dyin’, not a\\nbit; only I don’t want to die if I can help it. My time must be nigh at\\nhand now, for I be aud, and a hundred years is too much for any man to\\nexpect; and I’m so nigh it that the Aud Man is already whettin’ his\\nscythe. Ye see, I can’t get out o’ the habit of caffin’ about it all at\\nonce; the chafts will wag as they be used to. Some day soon the Angel of\\nDeath will sound his trumpet for me. But don’t ye dooal an’ greet, my\\ndeary!”--for he saw that I was crying--“if he should come this very\\nnight I’d not refuse to answer his call. For life be, after all, only a\\nwaitin’ for somethin’ else than what we’re doin’; and death be all that\\nwe can rightly depend on. But I’m content, for it’s comin’ to me, my\\ndeary, and comin’ quick. It may be comin’ while we be lookin’ and\\nwonderin’. Maybe it’s in that wind out over the sea that’s bringin’ with\\nit loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts. Look! look!” he\\ncried suddenly. “There’s something in that wind and in the hoast beyont\\nthat sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death. It’s in the\\nair; I feel it comin’. Lord, make me answer cheerful when my call\\ncomes!” He held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat. His mouth\\nmoved as though he were praying. After a few minutes’ silence, he got\\nup, shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said good-bye, and hobbled\\noff. It all touched me, and upset me very much.\\n\\nI was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spy-glass under his\\narm. He stopped to talk with me, as he always does, but all the time\\nkept looking at a strange ship.\\n\\n“I can’t make her out,” he said; “she’s a Russian, by the look of her;\\nbut she’s knocking about in the queerest way. She doesn’t know her mind\\na bit; she seems to see the storm coming, but can’t decide whether to\\nrun up north in the open, or to put in here. Look there again! She is\\nsteered mighty strangely, for she doesn’t mind the hand on the wheel;\\nchanges about with every puff of wind. We’ll hear more of her before\\nthis time to-morrow.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nCUTTING FROM “THE DAILYGRAPH,” 8 AUGUST\\n\\n\\n(_Pasted in Mina Murray’s Journal._)\\n\\nFrom a Correspondent.\\n\\n_Whitby_.\\n\\nOne of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been\\nexperienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather had\\nbeen somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of\\nAugust. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great\\nbody of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods,\\nRobin Hood’s Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in\\nthe neighbourhood of Whitby. The steamers _Emma_ and _Scarborough_ made\\ntrips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of\\n“tripping” both to and from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till the\\nafternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff\\nchurchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of\\nsea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of\\n“mares’-tails” high in the sky to the north-west. The wind was then\\nblowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical\\nlanguage is ranked “No. 2: light breeze.” The coastguard on duty at once\\nmade report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has\\nkept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic\\nmanner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset was so very\\nbeautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that\\nthere was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old\\nchurchyard to enjoy the beauty. Before the sun dipped below the black\\nmass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its\\ndownward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour--flame,\\npurple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here and\\nthere masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all\\nsorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. The\\nexperience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the\\nsketches of the “Prelude to the Great Storm” will grace the R. A. and R.\\nI. walls in May next. More than one captain made up his mind then and\\nthere that his “cobble” or his “mule,” as they term the different\\nclasses of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed.\\nThe wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there\\nwas a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on\\nthe approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature. There\\nwere but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers,\\nwhich usually “hug” the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but\\nfew fishing-boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreign\\nschooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The\\nfoolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for\\ncomment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal\\nher to reduce sail in face of her danger. Before the night shut down she\\nwas seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating\\nswell of the sea,\\n\\n    “As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.”\\n\\nShortly before ten o’clock the stillness of the air grew quite\\noppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep\\ninland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the\\nband on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord in the\\ngreat harmony of nature’s silence. A little after midnight came a\\nstrange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to\\ncarry a strange, faint, hollow booming.\\n\\nThen without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity which, at the\\ntime, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize,\\nthe whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. The waves rose in\\ngrowing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in a very few minutes\\nthe lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster.\\nWhite-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the\\nshelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept\\nthe lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier\\nof Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such\\nforce that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet,\\nor clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. It was found necessary\\nto clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the\\nfatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. To add to\\nthe difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came\\ndrifting inland--white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion,\\nso dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of\\nimagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were\\ntouching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many\\na one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. At times the mist\\ncleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the\\nlightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals\\nof thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock\\nof the footsteps of the storm.\\n\\nSome of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of\\nabsorbing interest--the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with\\neach wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to\\nsnatch at and whirl away into space; here and there a fishing-boat, with\\na rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again\\nthe white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird. On the summit of the East\\nCliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been\\ntried. The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in\\nthe pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.\\nOnce or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat,\\nwith gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance\\nof the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the\\npiers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of\\njoy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed\\nto cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.\\n\\nBefore long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner\\nwith all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed\\nearlier in the evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east,\\nand there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they\\nrealized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and the\\nport lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time\\nto time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter,\\nit would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the\\nharbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so\\ngreat that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost\\nvisible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such\\nspeed that, in the words of one old salt, “she must fetch up somewhere,\\nif it was only in hell.” Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than\\nany hitherto--a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things\\nlike a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing,\\nfor the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the\\nbooming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder\\nthan before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour\\nmouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited\\nbreathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant\\nof the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, _mirabile dictu_, between\\nthe piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed,\\nswept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and\\ngained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and a\\nshudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a\\ncorpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each\\nmotion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at all. A great\\nawe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had\\nfound the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However,\\nall took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. The\\nschooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on\\nthat accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many\\nstorms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the East\\nCliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.\\n\\nThere was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on\\nthe sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the\\n“top-hammer” came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instant\\nthe shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as\\nif shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow\\non the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard\\nhangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat\\ntombstones--“thruff-steans” or “through-stones,” as they call them in\\nthe Whitby vernacular--actually project over where the sustaining cliff\\nhas fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed\\nintensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.\\n\\nIt so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as\\nall those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were\\nout on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern\\nside of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the\\nfirst to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after scouring\\nthe entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the\\nlight on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran aft, and\\nwhen he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at\\nonce as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to pique general\\ncuriosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good way\\nround from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your\\ncorrespondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd.\\nWhen I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd,\\nwhom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. By the\\ncourtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted\\nto climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman\\nwhilst actually lashed to the wheel.\\n\\nIt was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for\\nnot often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened\\nby his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between\\nthe inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it\\nwas fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by\\nthe binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but\\nthe flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of\\nthe wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he\\nwas tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the\\nstate of things, and a doctor--Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot\\nPlace--who came immediately after me, declared, after making\\nexamination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In his\\npocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of\\npaper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard said\\nthe man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his\\nteeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some\\ncomplications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for coastguards cannot\\nclaim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a\\nderelict. Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young\\nlaw student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already\\ncompletely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the\\nstatutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of\\ndelegated possession, is held in a _dead hand_. It is needless to say\\nthat the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where\\nhe held his honourable watch and ward till death--a steadfastness as\\nnoble as that of the young Casabianca--and placed in the mortuary to\\nawait inquest.\\n\\nAlready the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating;\\ncrowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden over\\nthe Yorkshire wolds. I shall send, in time for your next issue, further\\ndetails of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into\\nharbour in the storm.\\n\\n_Whitby_\\n\\n_9 August._--The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the\\nstorm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. It\\nturns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the\\n_Demeter_. She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a\\nsmall amount of cargo--a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould.\\nThis cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S. F. Billington, of\\n7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took\\npossession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian consul, too,\\nacting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and\\npaid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here to-day except\\nthe strange coincidence; the officials of the Board of Trade have been\\nmost exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with\\nexisting regulations. As the matter is to be a “nine days’ wonder,” they\\nare evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after\\ncomplaint. A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which\\nlanded when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the\\nS. P. C. A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the\\nanimal. To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found;\\nit seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. It may be that it\\nwas frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still\\nhiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such a\\npossibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it\\nis evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred\\nmastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found\\ndead in the roadway opposite to its master’s yard. It had been fighting,\\nand manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away,\\nand its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later._--By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector, I have been\\npermitted to look over the log-book of the _Demeter_, which was in order\\nup to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest\\nexcept as to facts of missing men. The greatest interest, however, is\\nwith regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was to-day produced\\nat the inquest; and a more strange narrative than the two between them\\nunfold it has not been my lot to come across. As there is no motive for\\nconcealment, I am permitted to use them, and accordingly send you a\\nrescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and\\nsupercargo. It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with\\nsome kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and that\\nthis had developed persistently throughout the voyage. Of course my\\nstatement must be taken _cum grano_, since I am writing from the\\ndictation of a clerk of the Russian consul, who kindly translated for\\nme, time being short.\\n\\n                         LOG OF THE “DEMETER.”\\n\\n\\n_Varna to Whitby._\\n\\n_Written 18 July, things so strange happening, that I shall keep\\naccurate note henceforth till we land._\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nOn 6 July we finished taking in cargo, silver sand and boxes of earth.\\nAt noon set sail.

Men all steady fellows, who\\nsailed with me before. Mate could not make out what was wrong; they only\\ntold him there was _something_, and crossed themselves.

Expected fierce quarrel, but\\nall was quiet.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nOn 16 July mate reported in the morning that one of crew, Petrofsky, was\\nmissing. Could not account for it. Took larboard watch eight bells last\\nnight; was relieved by Abramoff, but did not go to bunk. Men more\\ndowncast than ever. All said they expected something of the kind, but\\nwould not say more than there was _something_ aboard. Mate getting very\\nimpatient with them; feared some trouble ahead.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nOn 17 July, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, came to my cabin, and in\\nan awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a strange man\\naboard the ship. He said that in his watch he had been sheltering\\nbehind the deck-house, as there was a rain-storm, when he saw a tall,\\nthin man, who was not like any of the crew, come up the companion-way,\\nand go along the deck forward, and disappear. He followed cautiously,\\nbut when he got to bows found no one, and the hatchways were all closed.\\nHe was in a panic of superstitious fear, and I am afraid the panic may\\nspread.

First mate angry; said it was folly, and to yield to such\\nfoolish ideas would demoralise the men; said he would engage to keep\\nthem out of trouble with a handspike. I let him take the helm, while the\\nrest began thorough search, all keeping abreast, with lanterns: we left\\nno corner unsearched. As there were only the big wooden boxes, there\\nwere no odd corners where a man could hide. Men much relieved when\\nsearch over, and went back to work cheerfully. First mate scowled, but\\nsaid nothing.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_22 July_.--Rough weather last three days, and all hands busy with\\nsails--no time to be frightened. Men seem to have forgotten their dread.\\nMate cheerful again, and all on good terms. Praised men for work in bad\\nweather. Passed Gibralter and out through Straits. All well.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_24 July_.--There seems some doom over this ship. Already a hand short,\\nand entering on the Bay of Biscay with wild weather ahead, and yet last\\nnight another man lost--disappeared. Like the first, he came off his\\nwatch and was not seen again. Men all in a panic of fear; sent a round\\nrobin, asking to have double watch, as they fear to be alone. Mate\\nangry. Fear there will be some trouble, as either he or the men will do\\nsome violence.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_28 July_.--Four days in hell, knocking about in a sort of maelstrom,\\nand the wind a tempest. No sleep for any one. Men all worn out. Hardly\\nknow how to set a watch, since no one fit to go on.

Had single watch to-night, as crew too\\ntired to double. When morning watch came on deck could find no one\\nexcept steersman. Raised outcry, and all came on deck. Thorough search,\\nbut no one found. Are now without second mate, and crew in a panic. Mate\\nand I agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_30 July_.--Last night. Rejoiced we are nearing England. Weather fine,\\nall sails set. Retired worn out; slept soundly; awaked by mate telling\\nme that both man of watch and steersman missing. Only self and mate and\\ntwo hands left to work ship.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_1 August_.--Two days of fog, and not a sail sighted. Had hoped when in\\nthe English Channel to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere.\\nNot having power to work sails, have to run before wind. Dare not lower,\\nas could not raise them again. We seem to be drifting to some terrible\\ndoom. Mate now more demoralised than either of men. His stronger nature\\nseems to have worked inwardly against himself. Men are beyond fear,\\nworking stolidly and patiently, with minds made up to worst. They are\\nRussian, he Roumanian.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_2 August, midnight_.--Woke up from few minutes’ sleep by hearing a cry,\\nseemingly outside my port. Could see nothing in fog. Rushed on deck, and\\nran against mate. Tells me heard cry and ran, but no sign of man on\\nwatch. One more gone. Lord, help us! Mate says we must be past Straits\\nof Dover, as in a moment of fog lifting he saw North Foreland, just as\\nhe heard the man cry out. If so we are now off in the North Sea, and\\nonly God can guide us in the fog, which seems to move with us; and God\\nseems to have deserted us.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_3 August_.--At midnight I went to relieve the man at the wheel, and\\nwhen I got to it found no one there. The wind was steady, and as we ran\\nbefore it there was no yawing. I dared not leave it, so shouted for the\\nmate. After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels. He\\nlooked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given\\nway. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my\\near, as though fearing the very air might hear: “_It_ is here; I know\\nit, now. On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin,\\nand ghastly pale. It was in the bows, and looking out. I crept behind\\nIt, and gave It my knife; but the knife went through It, empty as the\\nair.” And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into\\nspace. Then he went on: “But It is here, and I’ll find It. It is in the\\nhold, perhaps in one of those boxes. I’ll unscrew them one by one and\\nsee. You work the helm.” And, with a warning look and his finger on his\\nlip, he went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could\\nnot leave the helm. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool-chest\\nand a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad, stark,\\nraving mad, and it’s no use my trying to stop him. He can’t hurt those\\nbig boxes: they are invoiced as “clay,” and to pull them about is as\\nharmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay, and mind the helm, and\\nwrite these notes. I can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears.\\nThen, if I can’t steer to any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut\\ndown sails and lie by, and signal for help....\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nIt is nearly all over now. Just as I was beginning to hope that the mate\\nwould come out calmer--for I heard him knocking away at something in the\\nhold, and work is good for him--there came up the hatchway a sudden,\\nstartled scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he\\ncame as if shot from a gun--a raging madman, with his eyes rolling and\\nhis face convulsed with fear. “Save me! save me!” he cried, and then\\nlooked round on the blanket of fog. His horror turned to despair, and in\\na steady voice he said: “You had better come too, captain, before it is\\ntoo late. _He_ is there. I know the secret now. The sea will save me\\nfrom Him, and it is all that is left!” Before I could say a word, or\\nmove forward to seize him, he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately\\nthrew himself into the sea. I suppose I know the secret too, now. It was\\nthis madman who had got rid of the men one by one, and now he has\\nfollowed them himself. God help me! How am I to account for all these\\nhorrors when I get to port? _When_ I get to port! Will that ever be?\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_4 August._--Still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce. I know there is\\nsunrise because I am a sailor, why else I know not. I dared not go\\nbelow, I dared not leave the helm; so here all night I stayed, and in\\nthe dimness of the night I saw It--Him! God forgive me, but the mate was\\nright to jump overboard. It was better to die like a man; to die like a\\nsailor in blue water no man can object. But I am captain, and I must not\\nleave my ship. But I shall baffle this fiend or monster, for I shall tie\\nmy hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail, and along with\\nthem I shall tie that which He--It!--dare not touch; and then, come good\\nwind or foul, I shall save my soul, and my honour as a captain. I am\\ngrowing weaker, and the night is coming on. If He can look me in the\\nface again, I may not have time to act.... If we are wrecked, mayhap\\nthis bottle may be found, and those who find it may understand; if not,\\n... well, then all men shall know that I have been true to my trust. God\\nand the Blessed Virgin and the saints help a poor ignorant soul trying\\nto do his duty....\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nOf course the verdict was an open one. There is no evidence to adduce;\\nand whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is now\\nnone to say. The folk here hold almost universally that the captain is\\nsimply a hero, and he is to be given a public funeral. Already it is\\narranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up the Esk\\nfor a piece and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and up the abbey\\nsteps; for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff. The owners\\nof more than a hundred boats have already given in their names as\\nwishing to follow him to the grave.\\n\\nNo trace has ever been found of the great dog; at which there is much\\nmourning, for, with public opinion in its present state, he would, I\\nbelieve, be adopted by the town. To-morrow will see the funeral; and so\\nwill end this one more “mystery of the sea.”\\n\\n\\n_Mina Murray’s Journal._\\n\\n_8 August._--Lucy was very restless all night, and I, too, could not\\nsleep. The storm was fearful, and as it boomed loudly among the\\nchimney-pots, it made me shudder. When a sharp puff came it seemed to be\\nlike a distant gun. Strangely enough, Lucy did not wake; but she got up\\ntwice and dressed herself. Fortunately, each time I awoke in time and\\nmanaged to undress her without waking her, and got her back to bed. It\\nis a very strange thing, this sleep-walking, for as soon as her will is\\nthwarted in any physical way, her intention, if there be any,\\ndisappears, and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her\\nlife.\\n\\nEarly in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see\\nif anything had happened in the night. There were very few people about,\\nand though the sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, the big,\\ngrim-looking waves, that seemed dark themselves because the foam that\\ntopped them was like snow, forced themselves in through the narrow mouth\\nof the harbour--like a bullying man going through a crowd. Somehow I\\nfelt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea last night, but on land. But,\\noh, is he on land or sea? Where is he, and how? I am getting fearfully\\nanxious about him. If I only knew what to do, and could do anything!\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_10 August._--The funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was most\\ntouching. Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin\\nwas carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the\\nchurchyard. Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst\\nthe cortège of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down\\nagain. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way.\\nThe poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on\\nit when the time came and saw everything. Poor Lucy seemed much upset.\\nShe was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that\\nher dreaming at night is telling on her. She is quite odd in one thing:\\nshe will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness; or if\\nthere be, she does not understand it herself. There is an additional\\ncause in that poor old Mr. Swales was found dead this morning on our\\nseat, his neck being broken. He had evidently, as the doctor said,\\nfallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of\\nfear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder. Poor\\ndear old man! Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes! Lucy is so\\nsweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other\\npeople do. Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I did\\nnot much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals. One of the men\\nwho came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog.\\nThe dog is always with him. They are both quiet persons, and I never saw\\nthe man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During the service the dog would\\nnot come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few\\nyards off, barking and howling. Its master spoke to it gently, and then\\nharshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to make a\\nnoise. It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs\\nbristling out like a cat’s tail when puss is on the war-path. Finally\\nthe man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then\\ntook it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on\\nthe tombstone on which the seat is fixed. The moment it touched the\\nstone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble. It did\\nnot try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was\\nin such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect,\\nto comfort it. Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to\\ntouch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way. I greatly\\nfear that she is of too super-sensitive a nature to go through the world\\nwithout trouble. She will be dreaming of this to-night, I am sure. The\\nwhole agglomeration of things--the ship steered into port by a dead\\nman; his attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads; the\\ntouching funeral; the dog, now furious and now in terror--will all\\nafford material for her dreams.\\n\\nI think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so I\\nshall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood’s Bay and\\nback. She ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\nMINA MURRAY’S JOURNAL\\n\\n\\n_Same day, 11 o’clock p. m._--Oh, but I am tired! If it were not that I\\nhad made my diary a duty I should not open it to-night. We had a lovely\\nwalk. Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some\\ndear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse,\\nand frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot everything\\nexcept, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean\\nand give us a fresh start. We had a capital “severe tea” at Robin Hood’s\\nBay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow-window right over\\nthe seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should have\\nshocked the “New Woman” with our appetites. Men are more tolerant, bless\\nthem! Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest,\\nand with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls. Lucy was\\nreally tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could.\\nThe young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay\\nfor supper. Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller; I\\nknow it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I think that\\nsome day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new\\nclass of curates, who don’t take supper, no matter how they may be\\npressed to, and who will know when girls are tired. Lucy is asleep and\\nbreathing softly. She has more colour in her cheeks than usual, and\\nlooks, oh, so sweet. If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her\\nonly in the drawing-room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now.\\nSome of the “New Women” writers will some day start an idea that men and\\nwomen should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or\\naccepting. But I suppose the New Woman won’t condescend in future to\\naccept; she will do the proposing herself. And a nice job she will make\\nof it, too! There’s some consolation in that. I am so happy to-night,\\nbecause dear Lucy seems better. I really believe she has turned the\\ncorner, and that we are over her troubles with dreaming. I should be\\nquite happy if I only knew if Jonathan.... God bless and keep him.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_11 August, 3 a. m._--Diary again. No sleep now, so I may as well write.\\nI am too agitated to sleep. We have had such an adventure, such an\\nagonising experience. I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary....\\nSuddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense of fear\\nupon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me. The room was dark,\\nso I could not see Lucy’s bed; I stole across and felt for her. The bed\\nwas empty. I lit a match and found that she was not in the room. The\\ndoor was shut, but not locked, as I had left it. I feared to wake her\\nmother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some\\nclothes and got ready to look for her. As I was leaving the room it\\nstruck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her\\ndreaming intention. Dressing-gown would mean house; dress, outside.\\nDressing-gown and dress were both in their places. “Thank God,” I said\\nto myself, “she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress.” I ran\\ndownstairs and looked in the sitting-room. Not there! Then I looked in\\nall the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear\\nchilling my heart. Finally I came to the hall door and found it open. It\\nwas not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The people\\nof the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that\\nLucy must have gone out as she was. There was no time to think of what\\nmight happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. I took a\\nbig, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was striking one as I was in the\\nCrescent, and there was not a soul in sight. I ran along the North\\nTerrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected. At\\nthe edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to\\nthe East Cliff, in the hope or fear--I don’t know which--of seeing Lucy\\nin our favourite seat. There was a bright full moon, with heavy black,\\ndriving clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of\\nlight and shade as they sailed across. For a moment or two I could see\\nnothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary’s Church and all\\naround it. Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey\\ncoming into view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as\\na sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually\\nvisible. Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for\\nthere, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a\\nhalf-reclining figure, snowy white. The coming of the cloud was too\\nquick for me to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost\\nimmediately; but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind\\nthe seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was,\\nwhether man or beast, I could not tell; I did not wait to catch another\\nglance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the\\nfish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the East\\nCliff. The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see; I rejoiced\\nthat it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy’s condition. The\\ntime and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath\\ncame laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. I must have\\ngone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with\\nlead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty. When I got almost\\nto the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was now\\nclose enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow. There\\nwas undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the\\nhalf-reclining white figure. I called in fright, “Lucy! Lucy!” and\\nsomething raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white face\\nand red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the\\nentrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church was between me and\\nthe seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her. When I came in\\nview again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly\\nthat I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back\\nof the seat. She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living\\nthing about.\\n\\nWhen I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep. Her lips\\nwere parted, and she was breathing--not softly as usual with her, but in\\nlong, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every\\nbreath. As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the\\ncollar of her nightdress close around her throat. Whilst she did so\\nthere came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. I\\nflung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck,\\nfor I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air,\\nunclad as she was. I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to\\nhave my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the shawl at her\\nthroat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety\\nand pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing\\nbecame quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. When I\\nhad her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then began\\nvery gently to wake her. At first she did not respond; but gradually she\\nbecame more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing\\noccasionally. At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other\\nreasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly,\\ntill finally she opened her eyes and awoke. She did not seem surprised\\nto see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was.\\nLucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body must\\nhave been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking\\nunclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. She\\ntrembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once with\\nme home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child. As we\\npassed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince. She\\nstopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would not.\\nHowever, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there\\nwas a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with\\nmud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no\\none, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.\\n\\nFortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul. Once we saw\\na man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of\\nus; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as\\nthere are here, steep little closes, or “wynds,” as they call them in\\nScotland. My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought I\\nshould faint. I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her\\nhealth, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation\\nin case the story should get wind. When we got in, and had washed our\\nfeet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into\\nbed. Before falling asleep she asked--even implored--me not to say a\\nword to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure. I\\nhesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of her\\nmother’s health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her,\\nand thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted--nay,\\ninfallibly would--in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do\\nso. I hope I did right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to\\nmy wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. Lucy is sleeping\\nsoundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Same day, noon._--All goes well. Lucy slept till I woke her and seemed\\nnot to have even changed her side. The adventure of the night does not\\nseem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she\\nlooks better this morning than she has done for weeks. I was sorry to\\nnotice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her. Indeed, it might\\nhave been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced. I must have\\npinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are\\ntwo little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress\\nwas a drop of blood. When I apologised and was concerned about it, she\\nlaughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it. Fortunately it\\ncannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Same day, night._--We passed a happy day. The air was clear, and the\\nsun bright, and there was a cool breeze. We took our lunch to Mulgrave\\nWoods, Mrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the\\ncliff-path and joining her at the gate. I felt a little sad myself, for\\nI could not but feel how _absolutely_ happy it would have been had\\nJonathan been with me. But there! I must only be patient. In the evening\\nwe strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by Spohr\\nand Mackenzie, and went to bed early. Lucy seems more restful than she\\nhas been for some time, and fell asleep at once. I shall lock the door\\nand secure the key the same as before, though I do not expect any\\ntrouble to-night.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_12 August._--My expectations were wrong, for twice during the night I\\nwas wakened by Lucy trying to get out. She seemed, even in her sleep, to\\nbe a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed\\nunder a sort of protest. I woke with the dawn, and heard the birds\\nchirping outside of the window. Lucy woke, too, and, I was glad to see,\\nwas even better than on the previous morning. All her old gaiety of\\nmanner seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in beside me\\nand told me all about Arthur. I told her how anxious I was about\\nJonathan, and then she tried to comfort me. Well, she succeeded\\nsomewhat, for, though sympathy can’t alter facts, it can help to make\\nthem more bearable.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_13 August._--Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as\\nbefore. Again I awoke in the night, and found Lucy sitting up in bed,\\nstill asleep, pointing to the window. I got up quietly, and pulling\\naside the blind, looked out. It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft\\neffect of the light over the sea and sky--merged together in one great,\\nsilent mystery--was beautiful beyond words. Between me and the moonlight\\nflitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles. Once or\\ntwice it came quite close, but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing me,\\nand flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey. When I came back\\nfrom the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully.\\nShe did not stir again all night.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_14 August._--On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day. Lucy seems\\nto have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to\\nget her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or\\ndinner. This afternoon she made a funny remark. We were coming home for\\ndinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and\\nstopped to look at the view, as we generally do. The setting sun, low\\ndown in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness; the red light was\\nthrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe\\neverything in a beautiful rosy glow. We were silent for a while, and\\nsuddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself:--\\n\\n“His red eyes again! They are just the same.” It was such an odd\\nexpression, coming _apropos_ of nothing, that it quite startled me. I\\nslewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare\\nat her, and saw that she was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look on\\nher face that I could not quite make out; so I said nothing, but\\nfollowed her eyes. She appeared to be looking over at our own seat,\\nwhereon was a dark figure seated alone. I was a little startled myself,\\nfor it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like\\nburning flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion. The red\\nsunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary’s Church behind our\\nseat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the\\nrefraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved. I\\ncalled Lucy’s attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself\\nwith a start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that she\\nwas thinking of that terrible night up there. We never refer to it; so I\\nsaid nothing, and we went home to dinner. Lucy had a headache and went\\nearly to bed. I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself;\\nI walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet\\nsadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan. When coming home--it was then\\nbright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the\\nCrescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen--I threw a glance\\nup at our window, and saw Lucy’s head leaning out. I thought that\\nperhaps she was looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief and\\nwaved it. She did not notice or make any movement whatever. Just then,\\nthe moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell\\non the window. There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against\\nthe side of the window-sill and her eyes shut. She was fast asleep, and\\nby her, seated on the window-sill, was something that looked like a\\ngood-sized bird. I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs,\\nbut as I came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast\\nasleep, and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to her throat,\\nas though to protect it from cold.\\n\\nI did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; I have taken care that the\\ndoor is locked and the window securely fastened.\\n\\nShe looks so sweet as she sleeps; but she is paler than is her wont, and\\nthere is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like. I\\nfear she is fretting about something. I wish I could find out what it\\nis.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_15 August._--Rose later than usual. Lucy was languid and tired, and\\nslept on after we had been called. We had a happy surprise at breakfast.\\nArthur’s father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon. Lucy\\nis full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once. Later on\\nin the day she told me the cause. She is grieved to lose Lucy as her\\nvery own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to\\nprotect her. Poor dear, sweet lady! She confided to me that she has got\\nher death-warrant. She has not told Lucy, and made me promise secrecy;\\nher doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die, for\\nher heart is weakening. At any time, even now, a sudden shock would be\\nalmost sure to kill her. Ah, we were wise to keep from her the affair of\\nthe dreadful night of Lucy’s sleep-walking.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_17 August._--No diary for two whole days. I have not had the heart to\\nwrite. Some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness.\\nNo news from Jonathan, and Lucy seems to be growing weaker, whilst her\\nmother’s hours are numbering to a close. I do not understand Lucy’s\\nfading away as she is doing. She eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys\\nthe fresh air; but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and\\nshe gets weaker and more languid day by day; at night I hear her gasping\\nas if for air. I keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at\\nnight, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the open\\nwindow. Last night I found her leaning out when I woke up, and when I\\ntried to wake her I could not; she was in a faint. When I managed to\\nrestore her she was as weak as water, and cried silently between long,\\npainful struggles for breath. When I asked her how she came to be at the\\nwindow she shook her head and turned away. I trust her feeling ill may\\nnot be from that unlucky prick of the safety-pin. I looked at her throat\\njust now as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed.\\nThey are still open, and, if anything, larger than before, and the\\nedges of them are faintly white. They are like little white dots with\\nred centres. Unless they heal within a day or two, I shall insist on the\\ndoctor seeing about them.\\n\\n\\n_Letter, Samuel F.

Lucy is ever so much better. Last night she slept well all\\nnight, and did not disturb me once. The roses seem coming back already\\nto her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. If she\\nwere in any way anæmic I could understand it, but she is not. She is in\\ngay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness. All the morbid reticence\\nseems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if I\\nneeded any reminding, of _that_ night, and that it was here, on this\\nvery seat, I found her asleep. As she told me she tapped playfully with\\nthe heel of her boot on the stone slab and said:--\\n\\n“My poor little feet didn’t make much noise then! I daresay poor old Mr.\\nSwales would have told me that it was because I didn’t want to wake up\\nGeordie.” As she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if she\\nhad dreamed at all that night. Before she answered, that sweet, puckered\\nlook came into her forehead, which Arthur--I call him Arthur from her\\nhabit--says he loves; and, indeed, I don’t wonder that he does. Then she\\nwent on in a half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall it to\\nherself:--\\n\\n“I didn’t quite dream; but it all seemed to be real. I only wanted to be\\nhere in this spot--I don’t know why, for I was afraid of something--I\\ndon’t know what. I remember, though I suppose I was asleep, passing\\nthrough the streets and over the bridge. A fish leaped as I went by, and\\nI leaned over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling--the\\nwhole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once--as\\nI went up the steps. Then I had a vague memory of something long and\\ndark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very\\nsweet and very bitter all around me at once; and then I seemed sinking\\ninto deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I have\\nheard there is to drowning men; and then everything seemed passing away\\nfrom me; my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air.\\nI seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me,\\nand then there was a sort of agonising feeling, as if I were in an\\nearthquake, and I came back and found you shaking my body. I saw you do\\nit before I felt you.”\\n\\nThen she began to laugh. It seemed a little uncanny to me, and I\\nlistened to her breathlessly. I did not quite like it, and thought it\\nbetter not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to other\\nsubjects, and Lucy was like her old self again. When we got home the\\nfresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really more\\nrosy. Her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent a very\\nhappy evening together.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_19 August._--Joy, joy, joy! although not all joy. At last, news of\\nJonathan. The dear fellow has been ill; that is why he did not write. I\\nam not afraid to think it or say it, now that I know. Mr. Hawkins sent\\nme on the letter, and wrote himself, oh, so kindly. I am to leave in the\\nmorning and go over to Jonathan, and to help to nurse him if necessary,\\nand to bring him home. Mr. Hawkins says it would not be a bad thing if\\nwe were to be married out there. I have cried over the good Sister’s\\nletter till I can feel it wet against my bosom, where it lies. It is of\\nJonathan, and must be next my heart, for he is _in_ my heart. My journey\\nis all mapped out, and my luggage ready. I am only taking one change of\\ndress; Lucy will bring my trunk to London and keep it till I send for\\nit, for it may be that ... I must write no more; I must keep it to say\\nto Jonathan, my husband. The letter that he has seen and touched must\\ncomfort me till we meet.\\n\\n\\n_Letter, Sister Agatha, Hospital of St. Joseph and Ste.

He has had some fearful shock--so says\\nour doctor--and in his delirium his ravings have been dreadful; of\\nwolves and poison and blood; of ghosts and demons; and I fear to say of\\nwhat. Be careful with him always that there may be nothing to excite him\\nof this kind for a long time to come; the traces of such an illness as\\nhis do not lightly die away. We should have written long ago, but we\\nknew nothing of his friends, and there was on him nothing that any one\\ncould understand. He came in the train from Klausenburg, and the guard\\nwas told by the station-master there that he rushed into the station\\nshouting for a ticket for home. Seeing from his violent demeanour that\\nhe was English, they gave him a ticket for the furthest station on the\\nway thither that the train reached.\\n\\n“Be assured that he is well cared for.

About\\neight o’clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when\\nsetting. The attendant was struck by his manner, and knowing my interest\\nin him, encouraged him to talk. He is usually respectful to the\\nattendant and at times servile; but to-night, the man tells me, he was\\nquite haughty. Would not condescend to talk with him at all. All he\\nwould say was:--\\n\\n     “I don’t want to talk to you: you don’t count now; the Master is at\\n     hand.”\\n\\nThe attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has\\nseized him. If so, we must look out for squalls, for a strong man with\\nhomicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous. The\\ncombination is a dreadful one. At nine o’clock I visited him myself. His\\nattitude to me was the same as that to the attendant; in his sublime\\nself-feeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to him\\nas nothing. It looks like religious mania, and he will soon think that\\nhe himself is God. These infinitesimal distinctions between man and man\\nare too paltry for an Omnipotent Being. How these madmen give themselves\\naway! The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall; but the God created\\nfrom human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow. Oh,\\nif men only knew!\\n\\nFor half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and\\ngreater degree. I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept strict\\nobservation all the same. All at once that shifty look came into his\\neyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with it\\nthe shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to\\nknow so well. He became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his\\nbed resignedly, and looked into space with lack-lustre eyes. I thought I\\nwould find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and tried to\\nlead him to talk of his pets, a theme which had never failed to excite\\nhis attention. At first he made no reply, but at length said testily:--\\n\\n“Bother them all! I don’t care a pin about them.”\\n\\n“What?” I said. “You don’t mean to tell me you don’t care about\\nspiders?” (Spiders at present are his hobby and the note-book is filling\\nup with columns of small figures.) To this he answered enigmatically:--\\n\\n“The bride-maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride;\\nbut when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to the eyes\\nthat are filled.”\\n\\nHe would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated on his bed\\nall the time I remained with him.\\n\\nI am weary to-night and low in spirits. I cannot but think of Lucy, and\\nhow different things might have been. If I don’t sleep at once, chloral,\\nthe modern Morpheus--C_{2}HCl_{3}O. H_{2}O! I must be careful not to let\\nit grow into a habit. No, I shall take none to-night! I have thought of\\nLucy, and I shall not dishonour her by mixing the two. If need be,\\nto-night shall be sleepless....\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later._--Glad I made the resolution; gladder that I kept to it. I had\\nlain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the\\nnight-watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield\\nhad escaped. I threw on my clothes and ran down at once; my patient is\\ntoo dangerous a person to be roaming about. Those ideas of his might\\nwork out dangerously with strangers. The attendant was waiting for me.\\nHe said he had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his\\nbed, when he had looked through the observation-trap in the door. His\\nattention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out. He\\nran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at once\\nsent up for me. He was only in his night-gear, and cannot be far off.\\nThe attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should\\ngo than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out\\nof the building by the door. He is a bulky man, and couldn’t get through\\nthe window. I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost,\\nand, as we were only a few feet above ground, landed unhurt. The\\nattendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a\\nstraight line, so I ran as quickly as I could. As I got through the belt\\nof trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our\\ngrounds from those of the deserted house.\\n\\nI ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men\\nimmediately and follow me into the grounds of Carfax, in case our friend\\nmight be dangerous. I got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall,\\ndropped down on the other side. I could see Renfield’s figure just\\ndisappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after him. On the\\nfar side of the house I found him pressed close against the old\\nironbound oak door of the chapel. He was talking, apparently to some\\none, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying, lest\\nI might frighten him, and he should run off. Chasing an errant swarm of\\nbees is nothing to following a naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping\\nis upon him! After a few minutes, however, I could see that he did not\\ntake note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to\\nhim--the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him\\nin. I heard him say:--\\n\\n“I am here to do Your bidding, Master. I am Your slave, and You will\\nreward me, for I shall be faithful. I have worshipped You long and afar\\noff. Now that You are near, I await Your commands, and You will not pass\\nme by, will You, dear Master, in Your distribution of good things?”\\n\\nHe _is_ a selfish old beggar anyhow. He thinks of the loaves and fishes\\neven when he believes he is in a Real Presence. His manias make a\\nstartling combination. When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger.\\nHe is immensely strong, for he was more like a wild beast than a man. I\\nnever saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before; and I hope I\\nshall not again. It is a mercy that we have found out his strength and\\nhis danger in good time. With strength and determination like his, he\\nmight have done wild work before he was caged. He is safe now at any\\nrate. Jack Sheppard himself couldn’t get free from the strait-waistcoat\\nthat keeps him restrained, and he’s chained to the wall in the padded\\nroom. His cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are\\nmore deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement.\\n\\nJust now he spoke coherent words for the first time:--\\n\\n“I shall be patient, Master. It is coming--coming--coming!”\\n\\nSo I took the hint, and came too. I was too excited to sleep, but this\\ndiary has quieted me, and I feel I shall get some sleep to-night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\n\\n_Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra._\\n\\n“_Buda-Pesth, 24 August._\\n\\n“My dearest Lucy,--\\n\\n“I know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we\\nparted at the railway station at Whitby. Well, my dear, I got to Hull\\nall right, and caught the boat to Hamburg, and then the train on here. I\\nfeel that I can hardly recall anything of the journey, except that I\\nknew I was coming to Jonathan, and, that as I should have to do some\\nnursing, I had better get all the sleep I could.... I found my dear one,\\noh, so thin and pale and weak-looking. All the resolution has gone out\\nof his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his\\nface has vanished. He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not\\nremember anything that has happened to him for a long time past. At\\nleast, he wants me to believe so, and I shall never ask. He has had some\\nterrible shock, and I fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try\\nto recall it. Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse,\\ntells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head. I\\nwanted her to tell me what they were; but she would only cross herself,\\nand say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick were the\\nsecrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear\\nthem, she should respect her trust. She is a sweet, good soul, and the\\nnext day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up the subject again,\\nand after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved\\nabout, added: ‘I can tell you this much, my dear: that it was not about\\nanything which he has done wrong himself; and you, as his wife to be,\\nhave no cause to be concerned. He has not forgotten you or what he owes\\nto you. His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal can\\ntreat of.’ I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my\\npoor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl. The idea of\\n_my_ being jealous about Jonathan! And yet, my dear, let me whisper, I\\nfelt a thrill of joy through me when I _knew_ that no other woman was a\\ncause of trouble. I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see his\\nface while he sleeps. He is waking!...\\n\\n“When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get something\\nfrom the pocket; I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his things.\\nI saw that amongst them was his note-book, and was going to ask him to\\nlet me look at it--for I knew then that I might find some clue to his\\ntrouble--but I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent\\nme over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment.\\nThen he called me back, and when I came he had his hand over the\\nnote-book, and he said to me very solemnly:--\\n\\n“‘Wilhelmina’--I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has\\nnever called me by that name since he asked me to marry him--‘you know,\\ndear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be no\\nsecret, no concealment. I have had a great shock, and when I try to\\nthink of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if it\\nwas all real or the dreaming of a madman. You know I have had brain\\nfever, and that is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not want to\\nknow it. I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.’ For, my\\ndear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are\\ncomplete. ‘Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my ignorance? Here is\\nthe book. Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let me\\nknow; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to\\nthe bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.’ He fell\\nback exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him. I\\nhave asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding be this\\nafternoon, and am waiting her reply....\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n“She has come and told me that the chaplain of the English mission\\nchurch has been sent for. We are to be married in an hour, or as soon\\nafter as Jonathan awakes....\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n“Lucy, the time has come and gone. I feel very solemn, but very, very\\nhappy. Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was ready, and he\\nsat up in bed, propped up with pillows. He answered his ‘I will’ firmly\\nand strongly. I could hardly speak; my heart was so full that even those\\nwords seemed to choke me. The dear sisters were so kind. Please God, I\\nshall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilities\\nI have taken upon me. I must tell you of my wedding present. When the\\nchaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband--oh, Lucy, it\\nis the first time I have written the words ‘my husband’--left me alone\\nwith my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped it\\nup in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon\\nwhich was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing-wax,\\nand for my seal I used my wedding ring. Then I kissed it and showed it\\nto my husband, and told him that I would keep it so, and then it would\\nbe an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each\\nother; that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake\\nor for the sake of some stern duty. Then he took my hand in his, and oh,\\nLucy, it was the first time he took _his wife’s_ hand, and said that it\\nwas the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would go\\nthrough all the past again to win it, if need be. The poor dear meant to\\nhave said a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and I\\nshall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month, but the\\nyear.\\n\\n“Well, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him that I was the\\nhappiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give him\\nexcept myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my love\\nand duty for all the days of my life. And, my dear, when he kissed me,\\nand drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very solemn\\npledge between us....\\n\\n“Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is not only because\\nit is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear to\\nme. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from\\nthe schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now,\\nand with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me; so that\\nin your own married life you too may be all happy as I am. My dear,\\nplease Almighty God, your life may be all it promises: a long day of\\nsunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust. I must\\nnot wish you no pain, for that can never be; but I do hope you will be\\n_always_ as happy as I am _now_. Good-bye, my dear. I shall post this at\\nonce, and, perhaps, write you very soon again. I must stop, for Jonathan\\nis waking--I must attend to my husband!\\n\\n“Your ever-loving\\n\\n“MINA HARKER.”\\n\\n\\n_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Harker._\\n\\n“_Whitby, 30 August._\\n\\n“My dearest Mina,--\\n\\n“Oceans of love and millions of kisses, and may you soon be in your own\\nhome with your husband. I wish you could be coming home soon enough to\\nstay with us here. The strong air would soon restore Jonathan; it has\\nquite restored me. I have an appetite like a cormorant, am full of\\nlife, and sleep well. You will be glad to know that I have quite given\\nup walking in my sleep. I think I have not stirred out of my bed for a\\nweek, that is when I once got into it at night. Arthur says I am getting\\nfat. By the way, I forgot to tell you that Arthur is here. We have such\\nwalks and drives, and rides, and rowing, and tennis, and fishing\\ntogether; and I love him more than ever. He _tells_ me that he loves me\\nmore, but I doubt that, for at first he told me that he couldn’t love me\\nmore than he did then. But this is nonsense. There he is, calling to me.\\nSo no more just at present from your loving\\n\\n“LUCY.\\n\\n“P. S.--Mother sends her love. She seems better, poor dear.\\n“P. P. S.--We are to be married on 28 September.”\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n_20 August._--The case of Renfield grows even more interesting. He has\\nnow so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion.\\nFor the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent. Then one\\nnight, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring to\\nhimself: “Now I can wait; now I can wait.” The attendant came to tell\\nme, so I ran down at once to have a look at him. He was still in the\\nstrait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone\\nfrom his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading--I might\\nalmost say, “cringing”--softness. I was satisfied with his present\\ncondition, and directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated,\\nbut finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strange\\nthing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for,\\ncoming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while looking\\nfurtively at them:--\\n\\n“They think I could hurt you! Fancy _me_ hurting _you_! The fools!”\\n\\nIt was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociated\\neven in the mind of this poor madman from the others; but all the same I\\ndo not follow his thought. Am I to take it that I have anything in\\ncommon with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together; or has\\nhe to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well-being is needful\\nto him? I must find out later on. To-night he will not speak. Even the\\noffer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not tempt him. He will\\nonly say: “I don’t take any stock in cats. I have more to think of now,\\nand I can wait; I can wait.”\\n\\nAfter a while I left him. The attendant tells me that he was quiet\\nuntil just before dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy, and at\\nlength violent, until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted\\nhim so that he swooned into a sort of coma.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n... Three nights has the same thing happened--violent all day then quiet\\nfrom moonrise to sunrise. I wish I could get some clue to the cause. It\\nwould almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went.\\nHappy thought! We shall to-night play sane wits against mad ones. He\\nescaped before without our help; to-night he shall escape with it. We\\nshall give him a chance, and have the men ready to follow in case they\\nare required....\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_23 August._--“The unexpected always happens.” How well Disraeli knew\\nlife. Our bird when he found the cage open would not fly, so all our\\nsubtle arrangements were for nought. At any rate, we have proved one\\nthing; that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time. We shall in\\nfuture be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day. I have given\\norders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room,\\nwhen once he is quiet, until an hour before sunrise. The poor soul’s\\nbody will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it. Hark!\\nThe unexpected again! I am called; the patient has once more escaped.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later._--Another night adventure. Renfield artfully waited until the\\nattendant was entering the room to inspect. Then he dashed out past him\\nand flew down the passage. I sent word for the attendants to follow.\\nAgain he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him\\nin the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw me\\nhe became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, he\\nwould have tried to kill me. As we were holding him a strange thing\\nhappened. He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grew\\ncalm. I looked round instinctively, but could see nothing. Then I caught\\nthe patient’s eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as it looked\\ninto the moonlit sky except a big bat, which was flapping its silent and\\nghostly way to the west. Bats usually wheel and flit about, but this one\\nseemed to go straight on, as if it knew where it was bound for or had\\nsome intention of its own. The patient grew calmer every instant, and\\npresently said:--\\n\\n“You needn’t tie me; I shall go quietly!” Without trouble we came back\\nto the house. I feel there is something ominous in his calm, and shall\\nnot forget this night....\\n\\n\\n_Lucy Westenra’s Diary_\\n\\n_Hillingham, 24 August._--I must imitate Mina, and keep writing things\\ndown. Then we can have long talks when we do meet. I wonder when it will\\nbe. I wish she were with me again, for I feel so unhappy. Last night I\\nseemed to be dreaming again just as I was at Whitby. Perhaps it is the\\nchange of air, or getting home again. It is all dark and horrid to me,\\nfor I can remember nothing; but I am full of vague fear, and I feel so\\nweak and worn out. When Arthur came to lunch he looked quite grieved\\nwhen he saw me, and I hadn’t the spirit to try to be cheerful. I wonder\\nif I could sleep in mother’s room to-night. I shall make an excuse and\\ntry.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_25 August._--Another bad night. Mother did not seem to take to my\\nproposal. She seems not too well herself, and doubtless she fears to\\nworry me. I tried to keep awake, and succeeded for a while; but when the\\nclock struck twelve it waked me from a doze, so I must have been falling\\nasleep. There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window, but I\\ndid not mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose I must then have\\nfallen asleep. More bad dreams. I wish I could remember them. This\\nmorning I am horribly weak. My face is ghastly pale, and my throat pains\\nme. It must be something wrong with my lungs, for I don’t seem ever to\\nget air enough. I shall try to cheer up when Arthur comes, or else I\\nknow he will be miserable to see me so.\\n\\n\\n_Letter, Arthur Holmwood to Dr. Seward._\\n\\n“_Albemarle Hotel, 31 August._\\n\\n“My dear Jack,--\\n\\n“I want you to do me a favour. Lucy is ill; that is, she has no special\\ndisease, but she looks awful, and is getting worse every day. I have\\nasked her if there is any cause; I do not dare to ask her mother, for to\\ndisturb the poor lady’s mind about her daughter in her present state of\\nhealth would be fatal. Mrs. Westenra has confided to me that her doom is\\nspoken--disease of the heart--though poor Lucy does not know it yet. I\\nam sure that there is something preying on my dear girl’s mind. I am\\nalmost distracted when I think of her; to look at her gives me a pang. I\\ntold her I should ask you to see her, and though she demurred at\\nfirst--I know why, old fellow--she finally consented. It will be a\\npainful task for you, I know, old friend, but it is for _her_ sake, and\\nI must not hesitate to ask, or you to act. You are to come to lunch at\\nHillingham to-morrow, two o’clock, so as not to arouse any suspicion in\\nMrs. Westenra, and after lunch Lucy will take an opportunity of being\\nalone with you. I shall come in for tea, and we can go away together; I\\nam filled with anxiety, and want to consult with you alone as soon as I\\ncan after you have seen her. Do not fail!\\n\\n“ARTHUR.”\\n\\n\\n_Telegram, Arthur Holmwood to Seward._\\n\\n“_1 September._\\n\\n“Am summoned to see my father, who is worse. Am writing. Write me fully\\nby to-night’s post to Ring. Wire me if necessary.”\\n\\n\\n_Letter from Dr. Seward to Arthur Holmwood._\\n\\n“_2 September._\\n\\n“My dear old fellow,--\\n\\n“With regard to Miss Westenra’s health I hasten to let you know at once\\nthat in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any malady\\nthat I know of. At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied with\\nher appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when I saw\\nher last. Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have full\\nopportunity of examination such as I should wish; our very friendship\\nmakes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can\\nbridge over. I had better tell you exactly what happened, leaving you to\\ndraw, in a measure, your own conclusions. I shall then say what I have\\ndone and propose doing.\\n\\n“I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her mother was present,\\nand in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knew\\nto mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I have no\\ndoubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is.\\nWe lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we\\ngot, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness\\namongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with\\nme. We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained,\\nfor the servants were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed,\\nhowever, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chair\\nwith a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. When I saw that her\\nhigh spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction to\\nmake a diagnosis. She said to me very sweetly:--\\n\\n“‘I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.’ I reminded her\\nthat a doctor’s confidence was sacred, but that you were grievously\\nanxious about her. She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled that\\nmatter in a word. ‘Tell Arthur everything you choose. I do not care for\\nmyself, but all for him!’ So I am quite free.\\n\\n“I could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but I could not see\\nthe usual anæmic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to test the\\nquality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cord\\ngave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. It was a\\nslight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secured\\na few drops of the blood and have analysed them. The qualitative\\nanalysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, in\\nitself a vigorous state of health. In other physical matters I was quite\\nsatisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as there must be a\\ncause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be something\\nmental. She complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at\\ntimes, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but\\nregarding which she can remember nothing. She says that as a child she\\nused to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back,\\nand that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, where\\nMiss Murray found her; but she assures me that of late the habit has not\\nreturned. I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of; I\\nhave written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, of\\nAmsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the\\nworld. I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that all things\\nwere to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and your\\nrelations to Miss Westenra. This, my dear fellow, is in obedience to\\nyour wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can for\\nher. Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal\\nreason, so, no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his\\nwishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he knows\\nwhat he is talking about better than any one else. He is a philosopher\\nand a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day;\\nand he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an iron\\nnerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution,\\nself-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and the\\nkindliest and truest heart that beats--these form his equipment for the\\nnoble work that he is doing for mankind--work both in theory and\\npractice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. I\\ntell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence in\\nhim. I have asked him to come at once. I shall see Miss Westenra\\nto-morrow again. She is to meet me at the Stores, so that I may not\\nalarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call.\\n\\n“Yours always,\\n\\n“JOHN SEWARD.”\\n\\n\\n_Letter, Abraham Van Helsing, M. D., D. Ph., D. Lit., etc., etc., to Dr.\\nSeward._\\n\\n“_2 September._\\n\\n“My good Friend,--\\n\\n“When I have received your letter I am already coming to you. By good\\nfortune I can leave just at once, without wrong to any of those who have\\ntrusted me.

Tell your friend that when that time you suck from my wound so\\nswiftly the poison of the gangrene from that knife that our other\\nfriend, too nervous, let slip, you did more for him when he wants my\\naids and you call for them than all his great fortune could do.

Arthur Holmwood._\\n\\n“_3 September._\\n\\n“My dear Art,--\\n\\n“Van Helsing has come and gone. He came on with me to Hillingham, and\\nfound that, by Lucy’s discretion, her mother was lunching out, so that\\nwe were alone with her. Van Helsing made a very careful examination of\\nthe patient. He is to report to me, and I shall advise you, for of\\ncourse I was not present all the time. He is, I fear, much concerned,\\nbut says he must think. When I told him of our friendship and how you\\ntrust to me in the matter, he said: ‘You must tell him all you think.\\nTell him what I think, if you can guess it, if you will. Nay, I am not\\njesting. This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.’ I asked\\nwhat he meant by that, for he was very serious. This was when we had\\ncome back to town, and he was having a cup of tea before starting on his\\nreturn to Amsterdam. He would not give me any further clue. You must not\\nbe angry with me, Art, because his very reticence means that all his\\nbrains are working for her good. He will speak plainly enough when the\\ntime comes, be sure. So I told him I would simply write an account of\\nour visit, just as if I were doing a descriptive special article for\\n_The Daily Telegraph_. He seemed not to notice, but remarked that the\\nsmuts in London were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a\\nstudent here. I am to get his report to-morrow if he can possibly make\\nit. In any case I am to have a letter.\\n\\n“Well, as to the visit. Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I first\\nsaw her, and certainly looked better. She had lost something of the\\nghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. She was\\nvery sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make him\\nfeel at ease; though I could see that the poor girl was making a hard\\nstruggle for it. I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick\\nlook under his bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began to chat of\\nall things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite\\ngeniality that I could see poor Lucy’s pretense of animation merge into\\nreality. Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversation\\ngently round to his visit, and suavely said:--\\n\\n“‘My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are so\\nmuch beloved. That is much, my dear, ever were there that which I do not\\nsee. They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of a\\nghastly pale. To them I say: “Pouf!”’ And he snapped his fingers at me\\nand went on: ‘But you and I shall show them how wrong they are. How can\\nhe’--and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with\\nwhich once he pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, a\\nparticular occasion which he never fails to remind me of--‘know anything\\nof a young ladies? He has his madmans to play with, and to bring them\\nback to happiness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, and,\\noh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. But the\\nyoung ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell\\nthemselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many\\nsorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away to\\nsmoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all\\nto ourselves.’ I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the\\nprofessor came to the window and called me in. He looked grave, but\\nsaid: ‘I have made careful examination, but there is no functional\\ncause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost; it has\\nbeen, but is not. But the conditions of her are in no way anæmic. I have\\nasked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two question,\\nthat so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what she will say.\\nAnd yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. I must go\\nback home and think. You must send to me the telegram every day; and if\\nthere be cause I shall come again. The disease--for not to be all well\\nis a disease--interest me, and the sweet young dear, she interest me\\ntoo. She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I come.’\\n\\n“As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone.\\nAnd so now, Art, you know all I know. I shall keep stern watch. I trust\\nyour poor father is rallying. It must be a terrible thing to you, my\\ndear old fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people who\\nare both so dear to you. I know your idea of duty to your father, and\\nyou are right to stick to it; but, if need be, I shall send you word to\\ncome at once to Lucy; so do not be over-anxious unless you hear from\\nme.”\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n_4 September._--Zoöphagous patient still keeps up our interest in him.\\nHe had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Just\\nbefore the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knew\\nthe symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a\\nrun, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so\\nviolent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about five\\nminutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank\\ninto a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now. The\\nattendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really\\nappalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of the\\nother patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quite\\nunderstand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was\\nsome distance away. It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, and\\nas yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen,\\nwoe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show\\nsomething directly. I cannot quite understand it.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later._--Another change in my patient. At five o’clock I looked in on\\nhim, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be. He\\nwas catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture\\nby making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of\\npadding. When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his bad\\nconduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to\\nhis own room and to have his note-book again. I thought it well to\\nhumour him: so he is back in his room with the window open. He has the\\nsugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a\\nharvest of flies. He is not now eating them, but putting them into a\\nbox, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find\\na spider. I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any\\nclue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would not\\nrise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of\\nfar-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:--\\n\\n“All over! all over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I do\\nit for myself!” Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said:\\n“Doctor, won’t you be very good to me and let me have a little more\\nsugar? I think it would be good for me.”\\n\\n“And the flies?” I said.\\n\\n“Yes! The flies like it, too, and I like the flies; therefore I like\\nit.” And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do\\nnot argue. I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a man\\nas, I suppose, any in the world. I wish I could fathom his mind.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Midnight._--Another change in him. I had been to see Miss Westenra,\\nwhom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our\\nown gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling. As\\nhis room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than in\\nthe morning. It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky\\nbeauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows\\nand all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul\\nwater, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone\\nbuilding, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart\\nto endure it all. I reached him just as the sun was going down, and from\\nhis window saw the red disc sink. As it sank he became less and less\\nfrenzied; and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, an\\ninert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what intellectual\\nrecuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up\\nquite calmly and looked around him. I signalled to the attendants not to\\nhold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do. He went straight\\nover to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took his\\nfly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shut\\nthe window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All this surprised\\nme, so I asked him: “Are you not going to keep flies any more?”\\n\\n“No,” said he; “I am sick of all that rubbish!” He certainly is a\\nwonderfully interesting study. I wish I could get some glimpse of his\\nmind or of the cause of his sudden passion. Stop; there may be a clue\\nafter all, if we can find why to-day his paroxysms came on at high noon\\nand at sunset. Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at\\nperiods which affects certain natures--as at times the moon does others?\\nWe shall see.\\n\\n\\n_Telegram, Seward, London, to Van Helsing, Amsterdam._\\n\\n“_4 September._--Patient still better to-day.”\\n\\n\\n_Telegram, Seward, London, to Van Helsing, Amsterdam._\\n\\n“_5 September._--Patient greatly improved.

Come at once; do not\\nlose an hour. I hold over telegram to Holmwood till have seen you.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\n\\n_Letter, Dr. Seward to Hon. Arthur Holmwood._\\n\\n“_6 September._\\n\\n“My dear Art,--\\n\\n“My news to-day is not so good. Lucy this morning had gone back a bit.\\nThere is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it; Mrs.\\nWestenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted me\\nprofessionally about her. I took advantage of the opportunity, and told\\nher that my old master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was coming to\\nstay with me, and that I would put her in his charge conjointly with\\nmyself; so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly, for a\\nshock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in Lucy’s weak\\ncondition, might be disastrous to her. We are hedged in with\\ndifficulties, all of us, my poor old fellow; but, please God, we shall\\ncome through them all right. If any need I shall write, so that, if you\\ndo not hear from me, take it for granted that I am simply waiting for\\nnews. In haste\\n\\n“Yours ever,\\n\\n“JOHN SEWARD.”\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n_7 September._--The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met at\\nLiverpool Street was:--\\n\\n“Have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her?”\\n\\n“No,” I said. “I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram. I\\nwrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as Miss\\nWestenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be.”\\n\\n“Right, my friend,” he said, “quite right! Better he not know as yet;\\nperhaps he shall never know. I pray so; but if it be needed, then he\\nshall know all. And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You deal\\nwith the madmen. All men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuch\\nas you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God’s madmen,\\ntoo--the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do nor why\\nyou do it; you tell them not what you think. So you shall keep knowledge\\nin its place, where it may rest--where it may gather its kind around it\\nand breed. You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here.” He\\ntouched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself\\nthe same way. “I have for myself thoughts at the present. Later I shall\\nunfold to you.”\\n\\n“Why not now?” I asked. “It may do some good; we may arrive at some\\ndecision.” He stopped and looked at me, and said:--\\n\\n“My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it has\\nripened--while the milk of its mother-earth is in him, and the sunshine\\nhas not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull the\\near and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff,\\nand say to you: ‘Look! he’s good corn; he will make good crop when the\\ntime comes.’” I did not see the application, and told him so. For reply\\nhe reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as\\nhe used long ago to do at lectures, and said: “The good husbandman tell\\nyou so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find the\\ngood husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow; that is for\\nthe children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of\\nthe work of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my corn,\\nand Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if he sprout at all,\\nthere’s some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell.” He broke\\noff, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on, and very\\ngravely:--\\n\\n“You were always a careful student, and your case-book was ever more\\nfull than the rest. You were only student then; now you are master, and\\nI trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, that\\nknowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.\\nEven if you have not kept the good practise, let me tell you that this\\ncase of our dear miss is one that may be--mind, I say _may be_--of such\\ninterest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the\\nbeam, as your peoples say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is too\\nsmall. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises.\\nHereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. We\\nlearn from failure, not from success!”\\n\\nWhen I described Lucy’s symptoms--the same as before, but infinitely\\nmore marked--he looked very grave, but said nothing. He took with him a\\nbag in which were many instruments and drugs, “the ghastly paraphernalia\\nof our beneficial trade,” as he once called, in one of his lectures, the\\nequipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in,\\nMrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as I\\nexpected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained\\nthat even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in a case\\nwhere any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some\\ncause or other, the things not personal--even the terrible change in her\\ndaughter to whom she is so attached--do not seem to reach her. It is\\nsomething like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an\\nenvelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that\\nwhich it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be an ordered\\nselfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice\\nof egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have\\nknowledge of.\\n\\nI used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down\\na rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness\\nmore than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily that\\nI saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were\\nshown up to Lucy’s room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I\\nwas horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the\\nred seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of\\nher face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or\\nhear. Van Helsing’s face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged\\ntill they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did not\\nseem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. Then\\nVan Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. The\\ninstant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to\\nthe next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him and\\nclosed the door. “My God!” he said; “this is dreadful. There is no time\\nto be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart’s\\naction as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Is\\nit you or me?”\\n\\n“I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me.”\\n\\n“Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared.”\\n\\nI went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at\\nthe hall-door. When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the\\ndoor, and Arthur was stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying in\\nan eager whisper:--\\n\\n“Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, and\\nhave been in an agony. The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for\\nmyself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you,\\nsir, for coming.” When first the Professor’s eye had lit upon him he had\\nbeen angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in\\nhis stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which\\nseemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to\\nhim gravely as he held out his hand:--\\n\\n“Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She is\\nbad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that.” For he\\nsuddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. “You are to\\nhelp her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your\\nbest help.”\\n\\n“What can I do?” asked Arthur hoarsely. “Tell me, and I shall do it. My\\nlife is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for\\nher.” The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old\\nknowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:--\\n\\n“My young sir, I do not ask so much as that--not the last!”\\n\\n“What shall I do?” There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril\\nquivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder. “Come!”\\nhe said. “You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better than\\nme, better than my friend John.” Arthur looked bewildered, and the\\nProfessor went on by explaining in a kindly way:--\\n\\n“Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must have\\nor die. My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to perform\\nwhat we call transfusion of blood--to transfer from full veins of one to\\nthe empty veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he is\\nthe more young and strong than me”--here Arthur took my hand and wrung\\nit hard in silence--“but, now you are here, you are more good than us,\\nold or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our nerves are not\\nso calm and our blood not so bright than yours!” Arthur turned to him\\nand said:--\\n\\n“If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would\\nunderstand----”\\n\\nHe stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice.\\n\\n“Good boy!” said Van Helsing. “In the not-so-far-off you will be happy\\nthat you have done all for her you love. Come now and be silent. You\\nshall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you\\nmust leave at my sign. Say no word to Madame; you know how it is with\\nher! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!”\\n\\nWe all went up to Lucy’s room. Arthur by direction remained outside.\\nLucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not\\nasleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoke\\nto us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid\\nthem on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a narcotic, and\\ncoming over to the bed, said cheerily:--\\n\\n“Now, little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a good\\nchild. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes.” She had made\\nthe effort with success.\\n\\nIt astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, marked\\nthe extent of her weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began to\\nflicker in her eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest\\nits potency; and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor was\\nsatisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his\\ncoat. Then he added: “You may take that one little kiss whiles I bring\\nover the table. Friend John, help to me!” So neither of us looked whilst\\nhe bent over her.\\n\\nVan Helsing turning to me, said:\\n\\n“He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not\\ndefibrinate it.”\\n\\nThen with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the\\noperation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come\\nback to poor Lucy’s cheeks, and through Arthur’s growing pallor the joy\\nof his face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to grow\\nanxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he\\nwas. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy’s system must\\nhave undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her.\\nBut the Professor’s face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with\\nhis eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my own\\nheart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: “Do not stir an instant.\\nIt is enough. You attend him; I will look to her.” When all was over I\\ncould see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took his\\narm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round--the\\nman seems to have eyes in the back of his head:--\\n\\n“The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have\\npresently.” And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the\\npillow to the patient’s head. As he did so the narrow black velvet band\\nwhich she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old\\ndiamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up,\\nand showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but I\\ncould hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing’s\\nways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but turned to\\nme, saying: “Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port\\nwine, and let him lie down a while. He must then go home and rest, sleep\\nmuch and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given to\\nhis love. He must not stay here. Hold! a moment. I may take it, sir,\\nthat you are anxious of result. Then bring it with you that in all ways\\nthe operation is successful. You have saved her life this time, and you\\ncan go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. I shall tell\\nher all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what you\\nhave done. Good-bye.”\\n\\nWhen Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently,\\nbut her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as her\\nbreast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.\\nThe velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a\\nwhisper:--\\n\\n“What do you make of that mark on her throat?”\\n\\n“What do you make of it?”\\n\\n“I have not examined it yet,” I answered, and then and there proceeded\\nto loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two\\npunctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign of\\ndisease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some\\ntrituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it\\nwas, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned\\nthe idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed\\nwould have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must\\nhave lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.\\n\\n“Well?” said Van Helsing.\\n\\n“Well,” said I, “I can make nothing of it.” The Professor stood up. “I\\nmust go back to Amsterdam to-night,” he said. “There are books and\\nthings there which I want. You must remain here all the night, and you\\nmust not let your sight pass from her.”\\n\\n“Shall I have a nurse?” I asked.\\n\\n“We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see that\\nshe is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. You must not sleep all\\nthe night. Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon as\\npossible. And then we may begin.”\\n\\n“May begin?” I said. “What on earth do you mean?”\\n\\n“We shall see!” he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a moment\\nlater and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held\\nup:--\\n\\n“Remember, she is your charge. If you leave her, and harm befall, you\\nshall not sleep easy hereafter!”\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary--continued._\\n\\n_8 September._--I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate worked itself\\noff towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different being\\nfrom what she had been before the operation. Her spirits even were good,\\nand she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the\\nabsolute prostration which she had undergone. When I told Mrs. Westenra\\nthat Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her she\\nalmost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter’s renewed\\nstrength and excellent spirits. I was firm, however, and made\\npreparations for my long vigil. When her maid had prepared her for the\\nnight I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by\\nthe bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me\\ngratefully whenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemed\\nsinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together\\nand shook it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effort\\nand with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was apparent that she\\ndid not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:--\\n\\n“You do not want to go to sleep?”\\n\\n“No; I am afraid.”\\n\\n“Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we all crave for.”\\n\\n“Ah, not if you were like me--if sleep was to you a presage of horror!”\\n\\n“A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?”\\n\\n“I don’t know; oh, I don’t know. And that is what is so terrible. All\\nthis weakness comes to me in sleep; until I dread the very thought.”\\n\\n“But, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night. I am here watching you, and\\nI can promise that nothing will happen.”\\n\\n“Ah, I can trust you!” I seized the opportunity, and said: “I promise\\nyou that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once.”\\n\\n“You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I will\\nsleep!” And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank\\nback, asleep.\\n\\nAll night long I watched by her. She never stirred, but slept on and on\\nin a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. Her lips were\\nslightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a\\npendulum. There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no bad\\ndreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.\\n\\nIn the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took\\nmyself back home, for I was anxious about many things. I sent a short\\nwire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result\\nof the operation. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all\\nday to clear off; it was dark when I was able to inquire about my\\nzoöphagous patient. The report was good; he had been quite quiet for the\\npast day and night. A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst\\nI was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham to-night, as\\nit might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by the\\nnight mail and would join me early in the morning.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_9 September_.--I was pretty tired and worn out when I got to\\nHillingham. For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my\\nbrain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral\\nexhaustion. Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits. When she shook hands\\nwith me she looked sharply in my face and said:--\\n\\n“No sitting up to-night for you. You are worn out. I am quite well\\nagain; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I who\\nwill sit up with you.” I would not argue the point, but went and had my\\nsupper. Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, I\\nmade an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more than\\nexcellent port. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room next\\nher own, where a cozy fire was burning. “Now,” she said, “you must stay\\nhere. I shall leave this door open and my door too. You can lie on the\\nsofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to\\nbed whilst there is a patient above the horizon. If I want anything I\\nshall call out, and you can come to me at once.” I could not but\\nacquiesce, for I was “dog-tired,” and could not have sat up had I tried.\\nSo, on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything,\\nI lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything.\\n\\n\\n_Lucy Westenra’s Diary._\\n\\n_9 September._--I feel so happy to-night. I have been so miserably weak,\\nthat to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after\\na long spell of east wind out of a steel sky. Somehow Arthur feels very,\\nvery close to me. I seem to feel his presence warm about me. I suppose\\nit is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner\\neyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give Love\\nrein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills. I know\\nwhere my thoughts are. If Arthur only knew! My dear, my dear, your ears\\nmust tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking. Oh, the blissful rest of\\nlast night! How I slept, with that dear, good Dr. Seward watching me.\\nAnd to-night I shall not fear to sleep, since he is close at hand and\\nwithin call. Thank everybody for being so good to me! Thank God!\\nGood-night, Arthur.\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n_10 September._--I was conscious of the Professor’s hand on my head, and\\nstarted awake all in a second. That is one of the things that we learn\\nin an asylum, at any rate.\\n\\n“And how is our patient?”\\n\\n“Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me,” I answered.\\n\\n“Come, let us see,” he said. And together we went into the room.\\n\\nThe blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van\\nHelsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.\\n\\nAs I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I\\nheard the Professor’s low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a\\ndeadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back, and\\nhis exclamation of horror, “Gott in Himmel!” needed no enforcement from\\nhis agonised face. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his\\niron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees begin to tremble.\\n\\nThere on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly\\nwhite and wan-looking than ever. Even the lips were white, and the gums\\nseemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a\\ncorpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp\\nin anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit\\nstood to him, and he put it down again softly. “Quick!” he said. “Bring\\nthe brandy.” I flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter.\\nHe wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and\\nwrist and heart. He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonising\\nsuspense said:--\\n\\n“It is not too late. It beats, though but feebly. All our work is\\nundone; we must begin again. There is no young Arthur here now; I have\\nto call on you yourself this time, friend John.” As he spoke, he was\\ndipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; I\\nhad taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. There was no\\npossibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so,\\nwithout a moment’s delay, we began the operation. After a time--it did\\nnot seem a short time either, for the draining away of one’s blood, no\\nmatter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling--Van Helsing\\nheld up a warning finger. “Do not stir,” he said, “but I fear that with\\ngrowing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much\\ndanger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injection\\nof morphia.” He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his\\nintent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge\\nsubtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pride\\nthat I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid\\ncheeks and lips. No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to\\nfeel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.\\n\\nThe Professor watched me critically. “That will do,” he said. “Already?”\\nI remonstrated. “You took a great deal more from Art.” To which he\\nsmiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:--\\n\\n“He is her lover, her _fiancé_. You have work, much work, to do for her\\nand for others; and the present will suffice.”\\n\\nWhen we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied\\ndigital pressure to my own incision. I laid down, whilst I waited his\\nleisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By-and-by\\nhe bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for\\nmyself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half\\nwhispered:--\\n\\n“Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn up\\nunexpected, as before, no word to him. It would at once frighten him and\\nenjealous him, too. There must be none. So!”\\n\\nWhen I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said:--\\n\\n“You are not much the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and\\nrest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me.”\\n\\nI followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were. I\\nhad done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. I\\nfelt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at\\nwhat had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over\\nand over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how\\nshe could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to\\nshow for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for,\\nsleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little\\npunctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their\\nedges--tiny though they were.\\n\\nLucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and\\nstrong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When Van Helsing\\nhad seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict\\ninjunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear his\\nvoice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.\\n\\nLucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything\\nhad happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her mother\\ncame up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but\\nsaid to me gratefully:--\\n\\n“We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really\\nmust now take care not to overwork yourself. You are looking pale\\nyourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that you\\ndo!” As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily,\\nfor her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted\\ndrain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned\\nimploring eyes on me. I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my\\nlips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.\\n\\nVan Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me:\\n“Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong. I\\nstay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. You and\\nI must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. I have grave\\nreasons. No, do not ask them; think what you will. Do not fear to think\\neven the most not-probable. Good-night.”\\n\\nIn the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of\\nthem might not sit up with Miss Lucy. They implored me to let them; and\\nwhen I said it was Dr. Van Helsing’s wish that either he or I should sit\\nup, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the “foreign\\ngentleman.” I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because\\nI am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy’s account, that\\ntheir devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen\\nsimilar instances of woman’s kindness. I got back here in time for a\\nlate dinner; went my rounds--all well; and set this down whilst waiting\\nfor sleep. It is coming.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_11 September._--This afternoon I went over to Hillingham. Found Van\\nHelsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better. Shortly after I had\\narrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor. He opened it\\nwith much impressment--assumed, of course--and showed a great bundle of\\nwhite flowers.\\n\\n“These are for you, Miss Lucy,” he said.\\n\\n“For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!”\\n\\n“Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines.” Here\\nLucy made a wry face. “Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction or\\nin nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shall\\npoint out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing\\nso much beauty that he so loves so much distort. Aha, my pretty miss,\\nthat bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, but\\nyou do not know how. I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, and\\nhang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. Oh yes! they, like the\\nlotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the waters\\nof Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought\\nfor in the Floridas, and find him all too late.”\\n\\nWhilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling\\nthem. Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, and\\nhalf-disgust:--\\n\\n“Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why,\\nthese flowers are only common garlic.”\\n\\nTo my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his\\niron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:--\\n\\n“No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do;\\nand I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake of\\nothers if not for your own.” Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might\\nwell be, he went on more gently: “Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear\\nme. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so\\ncommon flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the\\nwreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make so\\ninquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience;\\nand obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait\\nfor you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend John, and you shall\\nhelp me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem,\\nwhere my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year.\\nI had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here.”\\n\\nWe went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor’s\\nactions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia\\nthat I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched them\\nsecurely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over\\nthe sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get\\nin would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbed\\nall over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round\\nthe fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me, and\\npresently I said:--\\n\\n“Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but\\nthis certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or he\\nwould say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.”\\n\\n“Perhaps I am!” he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which\\nLucy was to wear round her neck.\\n\\nWe then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she\\nwas in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her\\nneck. The last words he said to her were:--\\n\\n“Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do\\nnot to-night open the window or the door.”\\n\\n“I promise,” said Lucy, “and thank you both a thousand times for all\\nyour kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such\\nfriends?”\\n\\nAs we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:--\\n\\n“To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want--two nights of travel,\\nmuch reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow,\\nand a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning early\\nyou call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much\\nmore strong for my ‘spell’ which I have work. Ho! ho!”\\n\\nHe seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights\\nbefore and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It must\\nhave been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but\\nI felt it all the more, like unshed tears.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\n_Lucy Westenra’s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_12 September._--How good they all are to me. I quite love that dear Dr.\\nVan Helsing. I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers. He\\npositively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he must have been\\nright, for I feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dread\\nbeing alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall not\\nmind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that I\\nhave had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness,\\nor the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has\\nfor me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no\\ndreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings\\nnothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep,\\nand lying like Ophelia in the play, with “virgin crants and maiden\\nstrewments.” I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful!\\nThere is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already. Good-night,\\neverybody.\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n_13 September._--Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual,\\nup to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. The\\nProfessor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.\\n\\nLet all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at\\neight o’clock. It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all the\\nfresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature’s\\nannual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours,\\nbut had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we met\\nMrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room. She is always an early\\nriser. She greeted us warmly and said:--\\n\\n“You will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The dear child is still\\nasleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I\\nshould disturb her.” The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. He\\nrubbed his hands together, and said:--\\n\\n“Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working,” to\\nwhich she answered:--\\n\\n“You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy’s state this\\nmorning is due in part to me.”\\n\\n“How you do mean, ma’am?” asked the Professor.\\n\\n“Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into\\nher room. She was sleeping soundly--so soundly that even my coming did\\nnot wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of those\\nhorrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually\\na bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would be\\ntoo much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away\\nand opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will be\\npleased with her, I am sure.”\\n\\nShe moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. As\\nshe had spoken, I watched the Professor’s face, and saw it turn ashen\\ngrey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady\\nwas present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be;\\nhe actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into\\nher room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and\\nforcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.\\n\\nThen, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. He\\nraised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat\\nhis palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair,\\nand putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs\\nthat seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised\\nhis arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. “God! God!\\nGod!” he said. “What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that\\nwe are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the\\npagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poor\\nmother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such\\nthing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, we\\nmust not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh, how we are\\nbeset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!” Suddenly he\\njumped to his feet. “Come,” he said, “come, we must see and act. Devils\\nor no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him\\nall the same.” He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we\\nwent up to Lucy’s room.\\n\\nOnce again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed.\\nThis time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same\\nawful, waxen pallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness and\\ninfinite pity.\\n\\n“As I expected,” he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which\\nmeant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and then\\nbegan to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another\\noperation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised the\\nnecessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a\\nwarning hand. “No!” he said. “To-day you must operate. I shall provide.\\nYou are weakened already.” As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled\\nup his shirt-sleeve.\\n\\nAgain the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour to\\nthe ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. This time I\\nwatched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.\\n\\nPresently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she must\\nnot remove anything from Lucy’s room without consulting him; that the\\nflowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour\\nwas a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the case\\nhimself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and would\\nsend me word when to come.\\n\\nAfter another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and\\nseemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.\\n\\nWhat does it all mean? I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life\\namongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain.\\n\\n\\n_Lucy Westenra’s Diary._\\n\\n_17 September._--Four days and nights of peace. I am getting so strong\\nagain that I hardly know myself. It is as if I had passed through some\\nlong nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and\\nfeel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dim\\nhalf-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness\\nin which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress\\nmore poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to\\nlife as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since,\\nhowever, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems\\nto have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of my\\nwits--the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed\\nso close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and\\ncommanded me to do I know not what--have all ceased. I go to bed now\\nwithout any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grown\\nquite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from\\nHaarlem. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a\\nday in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be left\\nalone. Thank God for mother’s sake, and dear Arthur’s, and for all our\\nfriends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the change, for\\nlast night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time. I found\\nhim asleep twice when I awoke; but I did not fear to go to sleep again,\\nalthough the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against\\nthe window-panes.\\n\\n\\n_“The Pall Mall Gazette,” 18 September._\\n\\n                           THE ESCAPED WOLF.\\n\\n         PERILOUS ADVENTURE OF OUR INTERVIEWER.\\n\\n         _Interview with the Keeper in the Zoölogical Gardens._\\n\\nAfter many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using\\nthe words “Pall Mall Gazette” as a sort of talisman, I managed to find\\nthe keeper of the section of the Zoölogical Gardens in which the wolf\\ndepartment is included. Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in\\nthe enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down to\\nhis tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk,\\nelderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their\\nhospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty\\ncomfortable. The keeper would not enter on what he called “business”\\nuntil the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then when the\\ntable was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:--\\n\\n“Now, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want. You’ll excoose me\\nrefoosin’ to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals. I gives the\\nwolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore\\nI begins to arsk them questions.”\\n\\n“How do you mean, ask them questions?” I queried, wishful to get him\\ninto a talkative humour.\\n\\n“’Ittin’ of them over the ’ead with a pole is one way; scratchin’ of\\ntheir hears is another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a show-orf\\nto their gals. I don’t so much mind the fust--the ’ittin’ with a pole\\nafore I chucks in their dinner; but I waits till they’ve ’ad their\\nsherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the\\near-scratchin’. Mind you,” he added philosophically, “there’s a deal of\\nthe same nature in us as in them theer animiles. Here’s you a-comin’ and\\narskin’ of me questions about my business, and I that grumpy-like that\\nonly for your bloomin’ ’arf-quid I’d ’a’ seen you blowed fust ’fore I’d\\nanswer. Not even when you arsked me sarcastic-like if I’d like you to\\narsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me questions. Without offence\\ndid I tell yer to go to ’ell?”\\n\\n“You did.”\\n\\n“An’ when you said you’d report me for usin’ of obscene language that\\nwas ’ittin’ me over the ’ead; but the ’arf-quid made that all right. I\\nweren’t a-goin’ to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my ’owl\\nas the wolves, and lions, and tigers does. But, Lor’ love yer ’art, now\\nthat the old ’ooman has stuck a chunk of her tea-cake in me, an’ rinsed\\nme out with her bloomin’ old teapot, and I’ve lit hup, you may scratch\\nmy ears for all you’re worth, and won’t git even a growl out of me.\\nDrive along with your questions. I know what yer a-comin’ at, that ’ere\\nescaped wolf.”\\n\\n“Exactly. I want you to give me your view of it. Just tell me how it\\nhappened; and when I know the facts I’ll get you to say what you\\nconsider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will\\nend.”\\n\\n“All right, guv’nor. This ’ere is about the ’ole story. That ’ere wolf\\nwhat we called Bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from\\nNorway to Jamrach’s, which we bought off him four years ago. He was a\\nnice well-behaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of. I’m more\\nsurprised at ’im for wantin’ to get out nor any other animile in the\\nplace. But, there, you can’t trust wolves no more nor women.”\\n\\n“Don’t you mind him, sir!” broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery laugh. “’E’s\\ngot mindin’ the animiles so long that blest if he ain’t like a old wolf\\n’isself! But there ain’t no ’arm in ’im.”\\n\\n“Well, sir, it was about two hours after feedin’ yesterday when I first\\nhear my disturbance. I was makin’ up a litter in the monkey-house for a\\nyoung puma which is ill; but when I heard the yelpin’ and ’owlin’ I kem\\naway straight. There was Bersicker a-tearin’ like a mad thing at the\\nbars as if he wanted to get out. There wasn’t much people about that\\nday, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a ’ook\\nnose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin’ through it. He\\nhad a ’ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him,\\nfor it seemed as if it was ’im as they was hirritated at. He ’ad white\\nkid gloves on ’is ’ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says:\\n‘Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.’\\n\\n“‘Maybe it’s you,’ says I, for I did not like the airs as he give\\n’isself. He didn’t git angry, as I ’oped he would, but he smiled a kind\\nof insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth. ‘Oh no, they\\nwouldn’t like me,’ ’e says.\\n\\n“‘Ow yes, they would,’ says I, a-imitatin’ of him. ‘They always likes a\\nbone or two to clean their teeth on about tea-time, which you ’as a\\nbagful.’\\n\\n“Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin’ they\\nlay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his ears\\nsame as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didn’t put\\nin his hand and stroke the old wolf’s ears too!\\n\\n“‘Tyke care,’ says I. ‘Bersicker is quick.’\\n\\n“‘Never mind,’ he says. ‘I’m used to ’em!’\\n\\n“‘Are you in the business yourself?’ I says, tyking off my ’at, for a\\nman what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers.\\n\\n“‘No,’ says he, ‘not exactly in the business, but I ’ave made pets of\\nseveral.’ And with that he lifts his ’at as perlite as a lord, and walks\\naway. Old Bersicker kep’ a-lookin’ arter ’im till ’e was out of sight,\\nand then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn’t come hout the ’ole\\nhevening. Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolves\\nhere all began a-’owling. There warn’t nothing for them to ’owl at.\\nThere warn’t no one near, except some one that was evidently a-callin’ a\\ndog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road. Once or twice\\nI went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the ’owling\\nstopped. Just before twelve o’clock I just took a look round afore\\nturnin’ in, an’, bust me, but when I kem opposite to old Bersicker’s\\ncage I see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty. And\\nthat’s all I know for certing.”\\n\\n“Did any one else see anything?”\\n\\n“One of our gard’ners was a-comin’ ’ome about that time from a ’armony,\\nwhen he sees a big grey dog comin’ out through the garding ’edges. At\\nleast, so he says, but I don’t give much for it myself, for if he did ’e\\nnever said a word about it to his missis when ’e got ’ome, and it was\\nonly after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up all\\nnight-a-huntin’ of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered seein’\\nanything. My own belief was that the ’armony ’ad got into his ’ead.”\\n\\n“Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the\\nwolf?”\\n\\n“Well, sir,” he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, “I think I can;\\nbut I don’t know as ’ow you’d be satisfied with the theory.”\\n\\n“Certainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals from\\nexperience, can’t hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try?”\\n\\n“Well then, sir, I accounts for it this way; it seems to me that ’ere\\nwolf escaped--simply because he wanted to get out.”\\n\\nFrom the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke I\\ncould see that it had done service before, and that the whole\\nexplanation was simply an elaborate sell. I couldn’t cope in badinage\\nwith the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart,\\nso I said:--\\n\\n“Now, Mr. Bilder, we’ll consider that first half-sovereign worked off,\\nand this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you’ve told me\\nwhat you think will happen.”\\n\\n“Right y’are, sir,” he said briskly. “Ye’ll excoose me, I know, for\\na-chaffin’ of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as much\\nas telling me to go on.”\\n\\n“Well, I never!” said the old lady.\\n\\n“My opinion is this: that ’ere wolf is a-’idin’ of, somewheres. The\\ngard’ner wot didn’t remember said he was a-gallopin’ northward faster\\nthan a horse could go; but I don’t believe him, for, yer see, sir,\\nwolves don’t gallop no more nor dogs does, they not bein’ built that\\nway. Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they gets\\nin packs and does be chivyin’ somethin’ that’s more afeared than they is\\nthey can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is. But,\\nLor’ bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not half so\\nclever or bold as a good dog; and not half a quarter so much fight in\\n’im. This one ain’t been used to fightin’ or even to providin’ for\\nhisself, and more like he’s somewhere round the Park a-’idin’ an’\\na-shiverin’ of, and, if he thinks at all, wonderin’ where he is to get\\nhis breakfast from; or maybe he’s got down some area and is in a\\ncoal-cellar. My eye, won’t some cook get a rum start when she sees his\\ngreen eyes a-shining at her out of the dark! If he can’t get food he’s\\nbound to look for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher’s\\nshop in time. If he doesn’t, and some nursemaid goes a-walkin’ orf with\\na soldier, leavin’ of the hinfant in the perambulator--well, then I\\nshouldn’t be surprised if the census is one babby the less. That’s\\nall.”\\n\\nI was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing up\\nagainst the window, and Mr. Bilder’s face doubled its natural length\\nwith surprise.\\n\\n“God bless me!” he said. “If there ain’t old Bersicker come back by\\n’isself!”\\n\\nHe went to the door and opened it; a most unnecessary proceeding it\\nseemed to me. I have always thought that a wild animal never looks so\\nwell as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; a\\npersonal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.\\n\\nAfter all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder nor\\nhis wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog. The animal\\nitself was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of all\\npicture-wolves--Red Riding Hood’s quondam friend, whilst moving her\\nconfidence in masquerade.\\n\\nThe whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. The\\nwicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all the\\nchildren in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort of\\npenitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine\\nprodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender\\nsolicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:--\\n\\n“There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble;\\ndidn’t I say it all along? Here’s his head all cut and full of broken\\nglass. ’E’s been a-gettin’ over some bloomin’ wall or other. It’s a\\nshyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles.\\nThis ’ere’s what comes of it. Come along, Bersicker.”\\n\\nHe took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of meat that\\nsatisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of the\\nfatted calf, and went off to report.\\n\\nI came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is given\\nto-day regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo.\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n_17 September._--I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my\\nbooks, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy,\\nhad fallen sadly into arrear. Suddenly the door was burst open, and in\\nrushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I was\\nthunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord\\ninto the Superintendent’s study is almost unknown. Without an instant’s\\npause he made straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and,\\nas I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He was\\ntoo quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get my\\nbalance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.\\nBefore he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he was\\nsprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a\\nlittle pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not\\nintent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist,\\nkeeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the\\nattendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment\\npositively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor licking\\nup, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. He was\\neasily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quite\\nplacidly, simply repeating over and over again: “The blood is the life!\\nThe blood is the life!”\\n\\nI cannot afford to lose blood just at present; I have lost too much of\\nlate for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucy’s\\nillness and its horrible phases is telling on me. I am over-excited and\\nweary, and I need rest, rest, rest. Happily Van Helsing has not summoned\\nme, so I need not forego my sleep; to-night I could not well do without\\nit.\\n\\n\\n_Telegram, Van Helsing, Antwerp, to Seward, Carfax._\\n\\n(Sent to Carfax, Sussex, as no county given; delivered late by\\ntwenty-two hours.)\\n\\n“_17 September._--Do not fail to be at Hillingham to-night. If not\\nwatching all the time frequently, visit and see that flowers are as\\nplaced; very important; do not fail. Shall be with you as soon as\\npossible after arrival.”\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n_18 September._--Just off for train to London. The arrival of Van\\nHelsing’s telegram filled me with dismay. A whole night lost, and I know\\nby bitter experience what may happen in a night. Of course it is\\npossible that all may be well, but what _may_ have happened? Surely\\nthere is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accident\\nshould thwart us in all we try to do. I shall take this cylinder with\\nme, and then I can complete my entry on Lucy’s phonograph.\\n\\n\\n_Memorandum left by Lucy Westenra._\\n\\n_17 September. Night._--I write this and leave it to be seen, so that no\\none may by any chance get into trouble through me. This is an exact\\nrecord of what took place to-night. I feel I am dying of weakness, and\\nhave barely strength to write, but it must be done if I die in the\\ndoing.\\n\\nI went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr.\\nVan Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.\\n\\nI was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that\\nsleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now I\\nknow so well. I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in\\nthe next room--as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be--so that I might have\\ncalled him. I tried to go to sleep, but could not. Then there came to me\\nthe old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleep\\nwould try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to be\\nalone, I opened my door and called out: “Is there anybody there?” There\\nwas no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again.\\nThen outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog’s, but\\nmore fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out, but could\\nsee nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its\\nwings against the window. So I went back to bed again, but determined\\nnot to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in;\\nseeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. She\\nsaid to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont:--\\n\\n“I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all\\nright.”\\n\\nI feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in\\nand sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she did\\nnot take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a while\\nand then go back to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and I in\\nhers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She was\\nstartled and a little frightened, and cried out: “What is that?” I tried\\nto pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I could\\nhear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there was\\nthe low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a\\ncrash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor.\\nThe window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the\\naperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt grey\\nwolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting\\nposture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongst\\nother things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing\\ninsisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For a\\nsecond or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange\\nand horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over--as if struck\\nwith lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a\\nmoment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept my\\neyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole\\nmyriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken\\nwindow, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that\\ntravellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried to\\nstir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother’s poor body,\\nwhich seemed to grow cold already--for her dear heart had ceased to\\nbeat--weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while.\\n\\nThe time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered\\nconsciousness again. Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; the\\ndogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery,\\nseemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed and\\nstupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the\\nnightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort\\nme. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear\\ntheir bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them, and they\\ncame in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay\\nover me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through the\\nbroken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my\\ndear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I\\nhad got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them\\nto go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flew\\nopen for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went\\nin a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear\\nmother’s breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing\\nhad told me, but I didn’t like to remove them, and, besides, I would\\nhave some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised that\\nthe maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I went\\nto the dining-room to look for them.\\n\\nMy heart sank when I saw what had happened. They all four lay helpless\\non the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the table\\nhalf full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious,\\nand examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the\\nsideboard, I found that the bottle which mother’s doctor uses for\\nher--oh! did use--was empty. What am I to do? what am I to do? I am back\\nin the room with mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save for\\nthe sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead! I\\ndare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through the\\nbroken window.\\n\\nThe air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from\\nthe window, and the lights burn blue and dim. What am I to do? God\\nshield me from harm this night! I shall hide this paper in my breast,\\nwhere they shall find it when they come to lay me out. My dear mother\\ngone! It is time that I go too. Good-bye, dear Arthur, if I should not\\nsurvive this night. God keep you, dear, and God help me!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\nDR. SEWARD’S DIARY\\n\\n\\n_18 September._--I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early.\\nKeeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gently\\nand rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her\\nmother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while,\\nfinding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursed\\nthe laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an\\nhour--for it was now ten o’clock--and so rang and knocked again, but\\nmore impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed only\\nthe servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this\\ndesolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing\\ntight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too\\nlate? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of\\ndanger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses;\\nand I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry\\nanywhere.\\n\\nI could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and\\nlocked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard the\\nrapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse’s feet. They stopped at the\\ngate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue.\\nWhen he saw me, he gasped out:--\\n\\n“Then it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did you\\nnot get my telegram?”\\n\\nI answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his\\ntelegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here,\\nand that I could not make any one in the house hear me. He paused and\\nraised his hat as he said solemnly:--\\n\\n“Then I fear we are too late. God’s will be done!” With his usual\\nrecuperative energy, he went on: “Come. If there be no way open to get\\nin, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now.”\\n\\nWe went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen\\nwindow. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and\\nhanding it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I\\nattacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then\\nwith a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and\\nopened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There\\nwas no one in the kitchen or in the servants’ rooms, which were close at\\nhand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room,\\ndimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four\\nservant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead,\\nfor their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the\\nroom left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at\\neach other, and as we moved away he said: “We can attend to them later.”\\nThen we ascended to Lucy’s room. For an instant or two we paused at the\\ndoor to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With white\\nfaces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the\\nroom.\\n\\nHow shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her\\nmother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white\\nsheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the\\nbroken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror\\nfixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more\\ndrawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her\\nmother’s bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds\\nwhich we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled.\\nWithout a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching\\npoor Lucy’s breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who\\nlistens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:--\\n\\n“It is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!”\\n\\nI flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste\\nit, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I found\\non the table. The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I\\nfancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure,\\nbut returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on another\\noccasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her\\nhands. He said to me:--\\n\\n“I can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those maids.\\nFlick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make them\\nget heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold as\\nthat beside her. She will need be heated before we can do anything\\nmore.”\\n\\nI went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the\\nwomen. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently\\naffected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her\\nsleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to\\nthem they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern with\\nthem, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one life\\nwas bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice\\nMiss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad\\nas they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and\\nboiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. We\\ngot a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst\\nwe were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One\\nof the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then\\nshe returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come\\nwith a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that he\\nmust wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message,\\nand, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.\\n\\nI never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly\\nearnest. I knew--as he knew--that it was a stand-up fight with death,\\nand in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did not\\nunderstand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:--\\n\\n“If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade\\naway into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon.” He went\\non with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.\\n\\nPresently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to\\nbe of some effect. Lucy’s heart beat a trifle more audibly to the\\nstethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing’s\\nface almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in\\na hot sheet to dry her he said to me:--\\n\\n“The first gain is ours! Check to the King!”\\n\\nWe took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid\\nher in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I noticed\\nthat Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She was\\nstill unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had\\never seen her.\\n\\nVan Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her\\nand not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me\\nout of the room.\\n\\n“We must consult as to what is to be done,” he said as we descended the\\nstairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, he\\nclosing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, but\\nthe blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of\\ndeath which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly\\nobserves. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light\\nenough for our purposes. Van Helsing’s sternness was somewhat relieved\\nby a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind about\\nsomething, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:--\\n\\n“What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must have\\nanother transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl’s life\\nwon’t be worth an hour’s purchase. You are exhausted already; I am\\nexhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would have\\ncourage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open his\\nveins for her?”\\n\\n“What’s the matter with me, anyhow?”\\n\\nThe voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought\\nrelief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. Van\\nHelsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a\\nglad look came into his eyes as I cried out: “Quincey Morris!” and\\nrushed towards him with outstretched hands.\\n\\n“What brought you here?” I cried as our hands met.\\n\\n“I guess Art is the cause.”\\n\\nHe handed me a telegram:--\\n\\n“Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.\\nCannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is.\\nDo not delay.--HOLMWOOD.”\\n\\n“I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tell\\nme what to do.”\\n\\nVan Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in\\nthe eyes as he said:--\\n\\n“A brave man’s blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in\\ntrouble. You’re a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work against\\nus for all he’s worth, but God sends us men when we want them.”\\n\\nOnce again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heart\\nto go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and it\\ntold on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her\\nveins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other\\noccasions. Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see\\nand hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van\\nHelsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with\\ngood effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watched\\nwhilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids\\nto pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down\\nafter having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good\\nbreakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where\\nLucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or\\ntwo of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and was\\nthinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a look\\nof grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved.\\nHe handed me the paper saying only: “It dropped from Lucy’s breast when\\nwe carried her to the bath.”\\n\\nWhen I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause\\nasked him: “In God’s name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she,\\nmad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?” I was so bewildered that I\\ndid not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took the\\npaper, saying:--\\n\\n“Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall know\\nand understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now what\\nis it that you came to me to say?” This brought me back to fact, and I\\nwas all myself again.\\n\\n“I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act\\nproperly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have\\nto be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we\\nhad it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and you\\nknow, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra\\nhad disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let us\\nfill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to the\\nregistrar and go on to the undertaker.”\\n\\n“Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be\\nsad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that\\nlove her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old\\nman. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all the\\nmore for it! Now go.”\\n\\nIn the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him\\nthat Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was now\\ngoing on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told him\\nwhere I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:--\\n\\n“When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to\\nourselves?” I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty about\\nthe registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in\\nthe evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.\\n\\nWhen I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would see him\\nas soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room. She was still\\nsleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her\\nside. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he\\nexpected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.\\nSo I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where\\nthe blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or\\nrather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he said\\nto me:--\\n\\n“Jack Seward, I don’t want to shove myself in anywhere where I’ve no\\nright to be; but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girl\\nand wanted to marry her; but, although that’s all past and gone, I can’t\\nhelp feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that’s wrong\\nwith her? The Dutchman--and a fine old fellow he is; I can see\\nthat--said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have\\n_another_ transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.\\nNow I know well that you medical men speak _in camera_, and that a man\\nmust not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this is\\nno common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not that\\nso?”\\n\\n“That’s so,” I said, and he went on:--\\n\\n“I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did\\nto-day. Is not that so?”\\n\\n“That’s so.”\\n\\n“And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago down at his\\nown place he looked queer. I have not seen anything pulled down so quick\\nsince I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass\\nall in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at\\nher in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there\\nwasn’t enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a\\nbullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me without\\nbetraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?” As he spoke\\nthe poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture of suspense\\nregarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible\\nmystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. His very\\nheart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him--and there was a\\nroyal lot of it, too--to keep him from breaking down. I paused before\\nanswering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the\\nProfessor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessed\\nso much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered\\nin the same phrase: “That’s so.”\\n\\n“And how long has this been going on?”\\n\\n“About ten days.”\\n\\n“Ten days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature\\nthat we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood\\nof four strong men. Man alive, her whole body wouldn’t hold it.” Then,\\ncoming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper: “What took it\\nout?”\\n\\nI shook my head. “That,” I said, “is the crux. Van Helsing is simply\\nfrantic about it, and I am at my wits’ end. I can’t even hazard a guess.\\nThere has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out\\nall our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shall\\nnot occur again. Here we stay until all be well--or ill.” Quincey held\\nout his hand. “Count me in,” he said. “You and the Dutchman will tell me\\nwhat to do, and I’ll do it.”\\n\\nWhen she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy’s first movement was to feel\\nin her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsing\\nhad given me to read. The careful Professor had replaced it where it had\\ncome from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. Her eye then lit on Van\\nHelsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then she looked around the room,\\nand seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put her\\npoor thin hands before her pale face. We both understood what that\\nmeant--that she had realised to the full her mother’s death; so we tried\\nwhat we could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but\\nshe was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for\\na long time. We told her that either or both of us would now remain with\\nher all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk she fell\\ninto a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep she\\ntook the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped\\nover and took the pieces from her. All the same, however, she went on\\nwith the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her\\nhands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering\\nthe fragments. Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as\\nif in thought, but he said nothing.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_19 September._--All last night she slept fitfully, being always afraid\\nto sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it. The Professor and\\nI took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for a moment\\nunattended. Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I knew\\nthat all night long he patrolled round and round the house.\\n\\nWhen the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor Lucy’s\\nstrength. She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little\\nnourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good. At times she\\nslept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, between\\nsleeping and waking. Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more\\nhaggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale\\ngums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and\\nsharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently\\nchanged the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying\\none. In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him.\\nQuincey went off to meet him at the station.\\n\\nWhen he arrived it was nearly six o’clock, and the sun was setting full\\nand warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more\\ncolour to the pale cheeks. When he saw her, Arthur was simply choking\\nwith emotion, and none of us could speak. In the hours that had passed,\\nthe fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had\\ngrown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible\\nwere shortened. Arthur’s presence, however, seemed to act as a\\nstimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than she\\nhad done since we arrived. He too pulled himself together, and spoke as\\ncheerily as he could, so that the best was made of everything.\\n\\nIt was now nearly one o’clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting with\\nher. I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am entering\\nthis on Lucy’s phonograph. Until six o’clock they are to try to rest. I\\nfear that to-morrow will end our watching, for the shock has been too\\ngreat; the poor child cannot rally. God help us all.\\n\\n\\n_Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra._\\n\\n(Unopened by her.)\\n\\n“_17 September._\\n\\n“My dearest Lucy,--\\n\\n“It seems _an age_ since I heard from you, or indeed since I wrote. You\\nwill pardon me, I know, for all my faults when you have read all my\\nbudget of news. Well, I got my husband back all right; when we arrived\\nat Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though he had\\nan attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins. He took us to his house, where there\\nwere rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together. After\\ndinner Mr. Hawkins said:--\\n\\n“‘My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity; and may every\\nblessing attend you both. I know you both from children, and have, with\\nlove and pride, seen you grow up. Now I want you to make your home here\\nwith me. I have left to me neither chick nor child; all are gone, and in\\nmy will I have left you everything.’ I cried, Lucy dear, as Jonathan and\\nthe old man clasped hands. Our evening was a very, very happy one.\\n\\n“So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both my\\nbedroom and the drawing-room I can see the great elms of the cathedral\\nclose, with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow\\nstone of the cathedral and I can hear the rooks overhead cawing and\\ncawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner of\\nrooks--and humans. I am busy, I need not tell you, arranging things and\\nhousekeeping. Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are busy all day; for, now that\\nJonathan is a partner, Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him all about the\\nclients.\\n\\n“How is your dear mother getting on? I wish I could run up to town for a\\nday or two to see you, dear, but I dare not go yet, with so much on my\\nshoulders; and Jonathan wants looking after still. He is beginning to\\nput some flesh on his bones again, but he was terribly weakened by the\\nlong illness; even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden\\nway and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to his usual\\nplacidity. However, thank God, these occasions grow less frequent as the\\ndays go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, I trust. And now\\nI have told you my news, let me ask yours. When are you to be married,\\nand where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are you to wear,\\nand is it to be a public or a private wedding? Tell me all about it,\\ndear; tell me all about everything, for there is nothing which interests\\nyou which will not be dear to me. Jonathan asks me to send his\\n‘respectful duty,’ but I do not think that is good enough from the\\njunior partner of the important firm Hawkins & Harker; and so, as you\\nlove me, and he loves me, and I love you with all the moods and tenses\\nof the verb, I send you simply his ‘love’ instead. Good-bye, my dearest\\nLucy, and all blessings on you.\\n\\n“Yours,\\n\\n“MINA HARKER.”\\n\\n\\n_Report from Patrick Hennessey, M. D., M. R. C. S. L. K. Q. C. P. I.,\\netc., etc., to John Seward, M. D._\\n\\n“_20 September._\\n\\n“My dear Sir,--\\n\\n“In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the conditions of\\neverything left in my charge.... With regard to patient, Renfield, there\\nis more to say. He has had another outbreak, which might have had a\\ndreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended\\nwith any unhappy results. This afternoon a carrier’s cart with two men\\nmade a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours--the house to\\nwhich, you will remember, the patient twice ran away. The men stopped at\\nour gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers. I was\\nmyself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, and\\nsaw one of them come up to the house. As he passed the window of\\nRenfield’s room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called\\nhim all the foul names he could lay his tongue to. The man, who seemed a\\ndecent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to “shut up for a\\nfoul-mouthed beggar,” whereon our man accused him of robbing him and\\nwanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to\\nswing for it. I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice,\\nso he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his\\nmind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying: ‘Lor’ bless\\nyer, sir, I wouldn’t mind what was said to me in a bloomin’ madhouse. I\\npity ye and the guv’nor for havin’ to live in the house with a wild\\nbeast like that.’ Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told him\\nwhere the gate of the empty house was; he went away, followed by threats\\nand curses and revilings from our man. I went down to see if I could\\nmake out any cause for his anger, since he is usually such a\\nwell-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had\\never occurred. I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most\\ngenial in his manner. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he\\nblandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe\\nthat he was completely oblivious of the affair. It was, I am sorry to\\nsay, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an\\nhour I heard of him again. This time he had broken out through the\\nwindow of his room, and was running down the avenue. I called to the\\nattendants to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent\\non some mischief. My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which\\nhad passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden\\nboxes. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the\\nface, as if with violent exercise. Before I could get up to him the\\npatient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to\\nknock his head against the ground. If I had not seized him just at the\\nmoment I believe he would have killed the man there and then. The other\\nfellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt-end of his\\nheavy whip. It was a terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, but\\nseized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and\\nfro as if we were kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the others\\nwere both burly men. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we\\nbegan to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat\\non him, he began to shout: ‘I’ll frustrate them! They shan’t rob me!\\nthey shan’t murder me by inches! I’ll fight for my Lord and Master!’ and\\nall sorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very considerable\\ndifficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded\\nroom. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I set\\nit all right; and he is going on well.\\n\\n“The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for\\ndamages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us. Their\\nthreats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for\\nthe defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman. They said that if it\\nhad not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and\\nraising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of\\nhim. They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary\\nstate of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of\\ntheir occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their\\nlabours of any place of public entertainment. I quite understood their\\ndrift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and\\nwith each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore\\nthat they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of\\nmeeting so ‘bloomin’ good a bloke’ as your correspondent. I took their\\nnames and addresses, in case they might be needed. They are as\\nfollows:--Jack Smollet, of Dudding’s Rents, King George’s Road, Great\\nWalworth, and Thomas Snelling, Peter Farley’s Row, Guide Court, Bethnal\\nGreen. They are both in the employment of Harris & Sons, Moving and\\nShipment Company, Orange Master’s Yard, Soho.\\n\\n“I shall report to you any matter of interest occurring here, and shall\\nwire you at once if there is anything of importance.\\n\\n“Believe me, dear Sir,\\n\\n“Yours faithfully,\\n\\n“PATRICK HENNESSEY.”\\n\\n\\n_Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra_.\\n\\n(Unopened by her.)\\n\\n“_18 September._\\n\\n“My dearest Lucy,--\\n\\n“Such a sad blow has befallen us. Mr. Hawkins has died very suddenly.\\nSome may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him\\nthat it really seems as though we had lost a father. I never knew either\\nfather or mother, so that the dear old man’s death is a real blow to me.\\nJonathan is greatly distressed. It is not only that he feels sorrow,\\ndeep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life,\\nand now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a\\nfortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the\\ndream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another account. He says the\\namount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous. He\\nbegins to doubt himself. I try to cheer him up, and _my_ belief in _him_\\nhelps him to have a belief in himself. But it is here that the grave\\nshock that he experienced tells upon him the most. Oh, it is too hard\\nthat a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his--a nature which\\nenabled him by our dear, good friend’s aid to rise from clerk to master\\nin a few years--should be so injured that the very essence of its\\nstrength is gone. Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles in\\nthe midst of your own happiness; but, Lucy dear, I must tell some one,\\nfor the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathan\\ntries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in. I dread coming\\nup to London, as we must do the day after to-morrow; for poor Mr.\\nHawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his\\nfather. As there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chief\\nmourner. I shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a few\\nminutes. Forgive me for troubling you. With all blessings,\\n\\n“Your loving\\n\\n“MINA HARKER.”\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n_20 September._--Only resolution and habit can let me make an entry\\nto-night. I am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the world\\nand all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard\\nthis moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. And he has\\nbeen flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late--Lucy’s mother\\nand Arthur’s father, and now.... Let me get on with my work.\\n\\nI duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We wanted Arthur to\\ngo to rest also, but he refused at first. It was only when I told him\\nthat we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not\\nall break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed\\nto go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. “Come, my child,” he said;\\n“come with me. You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much\\nmental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of. You\\nmust not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms.\\nCome to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are two\\nsofas. You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will\\nbe comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we\\nsleep.” Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy’s\\nface, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. She lay\\nquite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it\\nshould be. I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room,\\nas in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the\\nwindow-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy’s neck, over the silk\\nhandkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of\\nthe same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and\\nher face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her\\nteeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they\\nhad been in the morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, the\\ncanine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by her,\\nand presently she moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sort\\nof dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly,\\nand peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight,\\nand I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled\\nround--doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim--and every now\\nand again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat,\\nI found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic\\nflowers from her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat\\nwatching her.\\n\\nPresently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed.\\nShe took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be with\\nher now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto\\nso marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment she\\nbecame conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It was\\ncertainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the\\nstertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she\\nwaked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making any\\nmistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many\\nspells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.\\n\\nAt six o’clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur had then fallen\\ninto a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy’s face\\nI could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a\\nsharp whisper: “Draw up the blind; I want light!” Then he bent down,\\nand, with his face almost touching Lucy’s, examined her carefully. He\\nremoved the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. As\\nhe did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, “Mein\\nGott!” as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and looked, too,\\nand as I noticed some queer chill came over me.\\n\\nThe wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.\\n\\nFor fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face\\nat its sternest. Then he turned to me and said calmly:--\\n\\n“She is dying. It will not be long now. It will be much difference, mark\\nme, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep. Wake that poor boy, and\\nlet him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have promised him.”\\n\\nI went to the dining-room and waked him. He was dazed for a moment, but\\nwhen he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters\\nhe thought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucy\\nwas still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van\\nHelsing and I feared that the end was near. He covered his face with his\\nhands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained,\\nperhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders\\nshook with grief. I took him by the hand and raised him up. “Come,” I\\nsaid, “my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best\\nand easiest for her.”\\n\\nWhen we came into Lucy’s room I could see that Van Helsing had, with\\nhis usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making\\neverything look as pleasing as possible. He had even brushed Lucy’s\\nhair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When we\\ncame into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered\\nsoftly:--\\n\\n“Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!” He was stooping to\\nkiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back. “No,” he whispered, “not\\nyet! Hold her hand; it will comfort her more.”\\n\\nSo Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best,\\nwith all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes. Then\\ngradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit her\\nbreast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child’s.\\n\\nAnd then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in\\nthe night. Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale\\ngums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. In a\\nsort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which\\nwere now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice,\\nsuch as I had never heard from her lips:--\\n\\n“Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!” Arthur bent\\neagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me,\\nhad been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by\\nthe neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which\\nI never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost\\nacross the room.\\n\\n“Not for your life!” he said; “not for your living soul and hers!” And\\nhe stood between them like a lion at bay.\\n\\nArthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do\\nor say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised\\nthe place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.\\n\\nI kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as\\nof rage flit like a shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champed\\ntogether. Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.\\n\\nVery shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and\\nputting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing’s great brown\\none; drawing it to her, she kissed it. “My true friend,” she said, in a\\nfaint voice, but with untellable pathos, “My true friend, and his! Oh,\\nguard him, and give me peace!”\\n\\n“I swear it!” he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his\\nhand, as one who registers an oath. Then he turned to Arthur, and said\\nto him: “Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the\\nforehead, and only once.”\\n\\nTheir eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.\\n\\nLucy’s eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took\\nArthur’s arm, and drew him away.\\n\\nAnd then Lucy’s breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it\\nceased.\\n\\n“It is all over,” said Van Helsing. “She is dead!”\\n\\nI took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where he\\nsat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way that\\nnearly broke me down to see.\\n\\nI went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, and\\nhis face was sterner than ever. Some change had come over her body.\\nDeath had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had\\nrecovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their\\ndeadly pallor. It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working\\nof the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as\\nmight be.\\n\\n    “We thought her dying whilst she slept,\\n        And sleeping when she died.”\\n\\nI stood beside Van Helsing, and said:--\\n\\n“Ah, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last. It is the end!”\\n\\nHe turned to me, and said with grave solemnity:--\\n\\n“Not so; alas! not so. It is only the beginning!”\\n\\nWhen I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered:--\\n\\n“We can do nothing as yet. Wait and see.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\nDR. SEWARD’S DIARY--_continued_.\\n\\n\\nThe funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and\\nher mother might be buried together. I attended to all the ghastly\\nformalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were\\nafflicted--or blessed--with something of his own obsequious suavity.\\nEven the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to\\nme, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out\\nfrom the death-chamber:--\\n\\n“She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It’s quite a privilege to\\nattend on her. It’s not too much to say that she will do credit to our\\nestablishment!”\\n\\nI noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible from\\nthe disordered state of things in the household. There were no relatives\\nat hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his\\nfather’s funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been\\nbidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon\\nourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over Lucy’s\\npapers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a\\nforeigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and\\nso might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me:--\\n\\n“I know; I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor. But\\nthis is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you avoided the\\ncoroner. I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more--such\\nas this.”\\n\\nAs he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been\\nin Lucy’s breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.\\n\\n“When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs.\\nWestenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. For me, I watch\\nhere in the room and in Miss Lucy’s old room all night, and I myself\\nsearch for what may be. It is not well that her very thoughts go into\\nthe hands of strangers.”\\n\\nI went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found\\nthe name and address of Mrs. Westenra’s solicitor and had written to\\nhim. All the poor lady’s papers were in order; explicit directions\\nregarding the place of burial were given. I had hardly sealed the\\nletter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room,\\nsaying:--\\n\\n“Can I help you, friend John? I am free, and if I may, my service is to\\nyou.”\\n\\n“Have you got what you looked for?” I asked, to which he replied:--\\n\\n“I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to find, and find I\\nhave, all that there was--only some letters and a few memoranda, and a\\ndiary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present say\\nnothing of them. I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with\\nhis sanction, I shall use some.”\\n\\nWhen we had finished the work in hand, he said to me:--\\n\\n“And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep, both you\\nand I, and rest to recuperate. To-morrow we shall have much to do, but\\nfor the to-night there is no need of us. Alas!”\\n\\nBefore turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The undertaker had\\ncertainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small\\n_chapelle ardente_. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers,\\nand death was made as little repulsive as might be. The end of the\\nwinding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over and\\nturned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tall\\nwax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well. All Lucy’s\\nloveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed,\\ninstead of leaving traces of “decay’s effacing fingers,” had but\\nrestored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes\\nthat I was looking at a corpse.\\n\\nThe Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had, and\\nthere was no need for tears in his eyes. He said to me: “Remain till I\\nreturn,” and left the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlic\\nfrom the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and\\nplaced the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then he\\ntook from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and\\nplaced it over the mouth. He restored the sheet to its place, and we\\ncame away.\\n\\nI was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the\\ndoor, he entered, and at once began to speak:--\\n\\n“To-morrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortem\\nknives.”\\n\\n“Must we make an autopsy?” I asked.\\n\\n“Yes and no. I want to operate, but not as you think. Let me tell you\\nnow, but not a word to another. I want to cut off her head and take out\\nher heart. Ah! you a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom I have seen with\\nno tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make\\nthe rest shudder. Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John, that\\nyou loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shall\\noperate, and you must only help. I would like to do it to-night, but for\\nArthur I must not; he will be free after his father’s funeral to-morrow,\\nand he will want to see her--to see _it_. Then, when she is coffined\\nready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep. We shall\\nunscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our operation: and then replace\\nall, so that none know, save we alone.”\\n\\n“But why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate her poor body\\nwithout need? And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and nothing\\nto gain by it--no good to her, to us, to science, to human\\nknowledge--why do it? Without such it is monstrous.”\\n\\nFor answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite\\ntenderness:--\\n\\n“Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart; and I love you the more\\nbecause it does so bleed. If I could, I would take on myself the burden\\nthat you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but that you\\nshall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant\\nthings. John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet\\ndid you ever know me to do any without good cause? I may err--I am but\\nman; but I believe in all I do. Was it not for these causes that you\\nsend for me when the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not amazed, nay\\nhorrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love--though she was\\ndying--and snatched him away by all my strength? Yes! And yet you saw\\nhow she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so\\nweak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me? Yes! And did you not\\nhear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful? Yes!\\n\\n“Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for many\\nyears trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be things so\\nstrange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friend\\nJohn. If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that is\\nnot perhaps well. And if I work--as work I shall, no matter trust or no\\ntrust--without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel,\\noh! so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!” He paused a\\nmoment and went on solemnly: “Friend John, there are strange and\\nterrible days before us. Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to\\na good end. Will you not have faith in me?”\\n\\nI took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open as he went away,\\nand watched him go into his room and close the door. As I stood without\\nmoving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage--she had\\nher back towards me, so did not see me--and go into the room where Lucy\\nlay. The sight touched me. Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful\\nto those who show it unasked to those we love. Here was a poor girl\\nputting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch\\nalone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor clay\\nmight not be lonely till laid to eternal rest....\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nI must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when Van\\nHelsing waked me by coming into my room. He came over to my bedside and\\nsaid:--\\n\\n“You need not trouble about the knives; we shall not do it.”\\n\\n“Why not?” I asked. For his solemnity of the night before had greatly\\nimpressed me.\\n\\n“Because,” he said sternly, “it is too late--or too early. See!” Here he\\nheld up the little golden crucifix. “This was stolen in the night.”\\n\\n“How, stolen,” I asked in wonder, “since you have it now?”\\n\\n“Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the\\nwoman who robbed the dead and the living. Her punishment will surely\\ncome, but not through me; she knew not altogether what she did and thus\\nunknowing, she only stole. Now we must wait.”\\n\\nHe went away on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to think of, a\\nnew puzzle to grapple with.\\n\\nThe forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr.\\nMarquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale. He was very genial\\nand very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all\\ncares as to details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for\\nsome time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs\\nin absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certain\\nentailed property of Lucy’s father’s which now, in default of direct\\nissue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate,\\nreal and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood. When he had\\ntold us so much he went on:--\\n\\n“Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and\\npointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either\\npenniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial\\nalliance. Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into\\ncollision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out\\nher wishes. Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept. We were\\nright in principle, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we should\\nhave proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment.\\nFrankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of\\ndisposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her\\nwishes. For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come\\ninto possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her\\nmother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no\\nwill--and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case--have been\\ntreated at her decease as under intestacy. In which case Lord Godalming,\\nthough so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world; and the\\ninheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just\\nrights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. I assure\\nyou, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced.”\\n\\nHe was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part--in which\\nhe was officially interested--of so great a tragedy, was an\\nobject-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.\\n\\nHe did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and\\nsee Lord Godalming. His coming, however, had been a certain comfort to\\nus, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile\\ncriticism as to any of our acts. Arthur was expected at five o’clock, so\\na little before that time we visited the death-chamber. It was so in\\nvery truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. The undertaker,\\ntrue to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods, and\\nthere was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at\\nonce. Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to,\\nexplaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would be\\nless harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his _fiancée_\\nquite alone. The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and\\nexerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them\\nthe night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelings\\nas we could avoid were saved.\\n\\nPoor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwart\\nmanhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his\\nmuch-tried emotions. He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly\\nattached to his father; and to lose him, and at such a time, was a\\nbitter blow to him. With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he\\nwas sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was some\\nconstraint with him. The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me to\\nbring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as I\\nfelt he would like to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm and\\nled me in, saying huskily:--\\n\\n“You loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there was\\nno friend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don’t know how to\\nthank you for all you have done for her. I can’t think yet....”\\n\\nHere he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and\\nlaid his head on my breast, crying:--\\n\\n“Oh, Jack! Jack! What shall I do! The whole of life seems gone from me\\nall at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for.”\\n\\nI comforted him as well as I could. In such cases men do not need much\\nexpression. A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the\\nshoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man’s\\nheart. I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I said\\nsoftly to him:--\\n\\n“Come and look at her.”\\n\\nTogether we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face.\\nGod! how beautiful she was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing her\\nloveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat; and as for Arthur, he\\nfell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. At\\nlast, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper:--\\n\\n“Jack, is she really dead?”\\n\\nI assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest--for I felt\\nthat such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than\\nI could help--that it often happened that after death faces became\\nsoftened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this was\\nespecially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged\\nsuffering. It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after\\nkneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and\\nlong, he turned aside. I told him that that must be good-bye, as the\\ncoffin had to be prepared; so he went back and took her dead hand in his\\nand kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead. He came away,\\nfondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came.\\n\\nI left him in the drawing-room, and told Van Helsing that he had said\\ngood-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker’s men\\nto proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. When he\\ncame out of the room again I told him of Arthur’s question, and he\\nreplied:--\\n\\n“I am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!”\\n\\nWe all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to make\\nthe best of things. Van Helsing had been silent all dinner-time; but\\nwhen we had lit our cigars he said--\\n\\n“Lord----”; but Arthur interrupted him:--\\n\\n“No, no, not that, for God’s sake! not yet at any rate. Forgive me, sir:\\nI did not mean to speak offensively; it is only because my loss is so\\nrecent.”\\n\\nThe Professor answered very sweetly:--\\n\\n“I only used that name because I was in doubt. I must not call you\\n‘Mr.,’ and I have grown to love you--yes, my dear boy, to love you--as\\nArthur.”\\n\\nArthur held out his hand, and took the old man’s warmly.\\n\\n“Call me what you will,” he said. “I hope I may always have the title of\\na friend. And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you for\\nyour goodness to my poor dear.” He paused a moment, and went on: “I know\\nthat she understood your goodness even better than I do; and if I was\\nrude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so--you remember”--the\\nProfessor nodded--“you must forgive me.”\\n\\nHe answered with a grave kindness:--\\n\\n“I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such\\nviolence needs to understand; and I take it that you do not--that you\\ncannot--trust me now, for you do not yet understand. And there may be\\nmore times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot--and may\\nnot--and must not yet understand. But the time will come when your trust\\nshall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as\\nthough the sunlight himself shone through. Then you shall bless me from\\nfirst to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for her\\ndear sake to whom I swore to protect.”\\n\\n“And, indeed, indeed, sir,” said Arthur warmly, “I shall in all ways\\ntrust you. I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you are\\nJack’s friend, and you were hers. You shall do what you like.”\\n\\nThe Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to\\nspeak, and finally said:--\\n\\n“May I ask you something now?”\\n\\n“Certainly.”\\n\\n“You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?”\\n\\n“No, poor dear; I never thought of it.”\\n\\n“And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will. I\\nwant you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy’s papers and\\nletters. Believe me, it is no idle curiosity. I have a motive of which,\\nbe sure, she would have approved. I have them all here. I took them\\nbefore we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touch\\nthem--no strange eye look through words into her soul. I shall keep\\nthem, if I may; even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep them\\nsafe. No word shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give them back\\nto you. It’s a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you not, for\\nLucy’s sake?”\\n\\nArthur spoke out heartily, like his old self:--\\n\\n“Dr. Van Helsing, you may do what you will. I feel that in saying this I\\nam doing what my dear one would have approved. I shall not trouble you\\nwith questions till the time comes.”\\n\\nThe old Professor stood up as he said solemnly:--\\n\\n“And you are right. There will be pain for us all; but it will not be\\nall pain, nor will this pain be the last. We and you too--you most of\\nall, my dear boy--will have to pass through the bitter water before we\\nreach the sweet. But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do our\\nduty, and all will be well!”\\n\\nI slept on a sofa in Arthur’s room that night. Van Helsing did not go to\\nbed at all. He went to and fro, as if patrolling the house, and was\\nnever out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn with\\nthe wild garlic flowers, which sent, through the odour of lily and rose,\\na heavy, overpowering smell into the night.\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker’s Journal._\\n\\n_22 September._--In the train to Exeter. Jonathan sleeping.\\n\\nIt seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how much\\nbetween then, in Whitby and all the world before me, Jonathan away and\\nno news of him; and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, a\\npartner, rich, master of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and\\nJonathan with another attack that may harm him. Some day he may ask me\\nabout it. Down it all goes. I am rusty in my shorthand--see what\\nunexpected prosperity does for us--so it may be as well to freshen it up\\nagain with an exercise anyhow....\\n\\nThe service was very simple and very solemn. There were only ourselves\\nand the servants there, one or two old friends of his from Exeter, his\\nLondon agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, the\\nPresident of the Incorporated Law Society. Jonathan and I stood hand in\\nhand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us....\\n\\nWe came back to town quietly, taking a ’bus to Hyde Park Corner.\\nJonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while, so\\nwe sat down; but there were very few people there, and it was\\nsad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs. It made us think\\nof the empty chair at home; so we got up and walked down Piccadilly.\\nJonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in old days\\nbefore I went to school. I felt it very improper, for you can’t go on\\nfor some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the\\npedantry of it biting into yourself a bit; but it was Jonathan, and he\\nwas my husband, and we didn’t know anybody who saw us--and we didn’t\\ncare if they did--so on we walked. I was looking at a very beautiful\\ngirl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano’s,\\nwhen I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, and he said\\nunder his breath: “My God!” I am always anxious about Jonathan, for I\\nfear that some nervous fit may upset him again; so I turned to him\\nquickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.\\n\\nHe was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and\\nhalf in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose and\\nblack moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty\\ngirl. He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us,\\nand so I had a good view of him. His face was not a good face; it was\\nhard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white teeth, that looked all\\nthe whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal’s.\\nJonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would notice. I\\nfeared he might take it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty. I asked\\nJonathan why he was disturbed, and he answered, evidently thinking that\\nI knew as much about it as he did: “Do you see who it is?”\\n\\n“No, dear,” I said; “I don’t know him; who is it?” His answer seemed to\\nshock and thrill me, for it was said as if he did not know that it was\\nto me, Mina, to whom he was speaking:--\\n\\n“It is the man himself!”\\n\\nThe poor dear was evidently terrified at something--very greatly\\nterrified; I do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to\\nsupport him he would have sunk down. He kept staring; a man came out of\\nthe shop with a small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then drove\\noff. The dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the carriage\\nmoved up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and hailed a\\nhansom. Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to himself:--\\n\\n“I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young. My God, if this be\\nso! Oh, my God! my God! If I only knew! if I only knew!” He was\\ndistressing himself so much that I feared to keep his mind on the\\nsubject by asking him any questions, so I remained silent. I drew him\\naway quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily. We walked a little\\nfurther, and then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park. It was\\na hot day for autumn, and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place.\\nAfter a few minutes’ staring at nothing, Jonathan’s eyes closed, and he\\nwent quietly into a sleep, with his head on my shoulder. I thought it\\nwas the best thing for him, so did not disturb him. In about twenty\\nminutes he woke up, and said to me quite cheerfully:--\\n\\n“Why, Mina, have I been asleep! Oh, do forgive me for being so rude.\\nCome, and we’ll have a cup of tea somewhere.” He had evidently forgotten\\nall about the dark stranger, as in his illness he had forgotten all that\\nthis episode had reminded him of. I don’t like this lapsing into\\nforgetfulness; it may make or continue some injury to the brain. I must\\nnot ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good; but I must somehow\\nlearn the facts of his journey abroad. The time is come, I fear, when I\\nmust open that parcel, and know what is written. Oh, Jonathan, you will,\\nI know, forgive me if I do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later._--A sad home-coming in every way--the house empty of the dear\\nsoul who was so good to us; Jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight\\nrelapse of his malady; and now a telegram from Van Helsing, whoever he\\nmay be:--\\n\\n“You will be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra died five days ago, and\\nthat Lucy died the day before yesterday. They were both buried to-day.”\\n\\nOh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words! Poor Mrs. Westenra! poor\\nLucy! Gone, gone, never to return to us! And poor, poor Arthur, to have\\nlost such sweetness out of his life! God help us all to bear our\\ntroubles.\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n_22 September._--It is all over. Arthur has gone back to Ring, and has\\ntaken Quincey Morris with him. What a fine fellow is Quincey! I believe\\nin my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucy’s death as any\\nof us; but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking. If America\\ncan go on breeding men like that, she will be a power in the world\\nindeed. Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to his\\njourney. He goes over to Amsterdam to-night, but says he returns\\nto-morrow night; that he only wants to make some arrangements which can\\nonly be made personally. He is to stop with me then, if he can; he says\\nhe has work to do in London which may take him some time. Poor old\\nfellow! I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his\\niron strength. All the time of the burial he was, I could see, putting\\nsome terrible restraint on himself. When it was all over, we were\\nstanding beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part in\\nthe operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy’s veins; I\\ncould see Van Helsing’s face grow white and purple by turns. Arthur was\\nsaying that he felt since then as if they two had been really married\\nand that she was his wife in the sight of God. None of us said a word of\\nthe other operations, and none of us ever shall. Arthur and Quincey went\\naway together to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on here. The\\nmoment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of\\nhysterics. He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and insisted\\nthat it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under very\\nterrible conditions. He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down\\nthe blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge; and then he cried,\\ntill he laughed again; and laughed and cried together, just as a woman\\ndoes. I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the\\ncircumstances; but it had no effect. Men and women are so different in\\nmanifestations of nervous strength or weakness! Then when his face grew\\ngrave and stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time.\\nHis reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical and\\nforceful and mysterious. He said:--\\n\\n“Ah, you don’t comprehend, friend John. Do not think that I am not sad,\\nthough I laugh. See, I have cried even when the laugh did choke me. But\\nno more think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh he come\\njust the same. Keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your\\ndoor and say, ‘May I come in?’ is not the true laughter. No! he is a\\nking, and he come when and how he like. He ask no person; he choose no\\ntime of suitability. He say, ‘I am here.’ Behold, in example I grieve my\\nheart out for that so sweet young girl; I give my blood for her, though\\nI am old and worn; I give my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my other\\nsufferers want that so she may have all. And yet I can laugh at her very\\ngrave--laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her\\ncoffin and say ‘Thud! thud!’ to my heart, till it send back the blood\\nfrom my cheek. My heart bleed for that poor boy--that dear boy, so of\\nthe age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with his\\nhair and eyes the same. There, you know now why I love him so. And yet\\nwhen he say things that touch my husband-heart to the quick, and make my\\nfather-heart yearn to him as to no other man--not even to you, friend\\nJohn, for we are more level in experiences than father and son--yet even\\nat such moment King Laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear,\\n‘Here I am! here I am!’ till the blood come dance back and bring some of\\nthe sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek. Oh, friend John, it is\\na strange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries, and woes, and\\ntroubles; and yet when King Laugh come he make them all dance to the\\ntune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and\\ntears that burn as they fall--all dance together to the music that he\\nmake with that smileless mouth of him. And believe me, friend John, that\\nhe is good to come, and kind. Ah, we men and women are like ropes drawn\\ntight with strain that pull us different ways. Then tears come; and,\\nlike the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain\\nbecome too great, and we break. But King Laugh he come like the\\nsunshine, and he ease off the strain again; and we bear to go on with\\nour labour, what it may be.”\\n\\nI did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea; but, as I\\ndid not yet understand the cause of his laughter, I asked him. As he\\nanswered me his face grew stern, and he said in quite a different\\ntone:--\\n\\n“Oh, it was the grim irony of it all--this so lovely lady garlanded with\\nflowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we wondered if she\\nwere truly dead; she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely\\nchurchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laid there with the mother\\nwho loved her, and whom she loved; and that sacred bell going ‘Toll!\\ntoll! toll!’ so sad and slow; and those holy men, with the white\\ngarments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the time\\ntheir eyes never on the page; and all of us with the bowed head. And all\\nfor what? She is dead; so! Is it not?”\\n\\n“Well, for the life of me, Professor,” I said, “I can’t see anything to\\nlaugh at in all that. Why, your explanation makes it a harder puzzle\\nthan before. But even if the burial service was comic, what about poor\\nArt and his trouble? Why, his heart was simply breaking.”\\n\\n“Just so. Said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins had\\nmade her truly his bride?”\\n\\n“Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him.”\\n\\n“Quite so. But there was a difficulty, friend John. If so that, then\\nwhat about the others? Ho, ho! Then this so sweet maid is a polyandrist,\\nand me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by Church’s law, though\\nno wits, all gone--even I, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife,\\nam bigamist.”\\n\\n“I don’t see where the joke comes in there either!” I said; and I did\\nnot feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things. He laid\\nhis hand on my arm, and said:--\\n\\n“Friend John, forgive me if I pain. I showed not my feeling to others\\nwhen it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust.\\nIf you could have looked into my very heart then when I want to laugh;\\nif you could have done so when the laugh arrived; if you could do so\\nnow, when King Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him--for\\nhe go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time--maybe you would\\nperhaps pity me the most of all.”\\n\\nI was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why.\\n\\n“Because I know!”\\n\\nAnd now we are all scattered; and for many a long day loneliness will\\nsit over our roofs with brooding wings. Lucy lies in the tomb of her\\nkin, a lordly death-house in a lonely churchyard, away from teeming\\nLondon; where the air is fresh, and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill,\\nand where wild flowers grow of their own accord.\\n\\nSo I can finish this diary; and God only knows if I shall ever begin\\nanother. If I do, or if I even open this again, it will be to deal with\\ndifferent people and different themes; for here at the end, where the\\nromance of my life is told, ere I go back to take up the thread of my\\nlife-work, I say sadly and without hope,\\n\\n                        “FINIS.”\\n\\n\\n_“The Westminster Gazette,” 25 September._\\n\\n                          A HAMPSTEAD MYSTERY.\\n\\n\\nThe neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with a\\nseries of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what\\nwas known to the writers of headlines as “The Kensington Horror,” or\\n“The Stabbing Woman,” or “The Woman in Black.” During the past two or\\nthree days several cases have occurred of young children straying from\\nhome or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath. In all\\nthese cases the children were too young to give any properly\\nintelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excuses\\nis that they had been with a “bloofer lady.” It has always been late in\\nthe evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions the\\nchildren have not been found until early in the following morning. It is\\ngenerally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child missed\\ngave as his reason for being away that a “bloofer lady” had asked him to\\ncome for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it as\\noccasion served. This is the more natural as the favourite game of the\\nlittle ones at present is luring each other away by wiles. A\\ncorrespondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to\\nbe the “bloofer lady” is supremely funny. Some of our caricaturists\\nmight, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the\\nreality and the picture. It is only in accordance with general\\nprinciples of human nature that the “bloofer lady” should be the popular\\nrôle at these _al fresco_ performances. Our correspondent naïvely says\\nthat even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of\\nthese grubby-faced little children pretend--and even imagine\\nthemselves--to be.\\n\\nThere is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some of\\nthe children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been\\nslightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might be\\nmade by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance\\nindividually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has\\na system or method of its own. The police of the division have been\\ninstructed to keep a sharp look-out for straying children, especially\\nwhen very young, in and around Hampstead Heath, and for any stray dog\\nwhich may be about.\\n\\n\\n               _“The Westminster Gazette,” 25 September._\\n\\n                            _Extra Special._\\n\\n                         THE HAMPSTEAD HORROR.\\n\\n                         ANOTHER CHILD INJURED.\\n\\n                         _The “Bloofer Lady.”_\\n\\nWe have just received intelligence that another child, missed last\\nnight, was only discovered late in the morning under a furze bush at the\\nShooter’s Hill side of Hampstead Heath, which is, perhaps, less\\nfrequented than the other parts. It has the same tiny wound in the\\nthroat as has been noticed in other cases. It was terribly weak, and\\nlooked quite emaciated. It too, when partially restored, had the common\\nstory to tell of being lured away by the “bloofer lady.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\nMINA HARKER’S JOURNAL\\n\\n\\n_23 September_.--Jonathan is better after a bad night.

And yet that man\\nwe saw yesterday! He seemed quite certain of him.... Poor fellow! I\\nsuppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some\\ntrain of thought.... He believes it all himself. I remember how on our\\nwedding-day he said: “Unless some solemn duty come upon me to go back to\\nthe bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane.” There seems to be\\nthrough it all some thread of continuity.... That fearful Count was\\ncoming to London.... If it should be, and he came to London, with his\\nteeming millions.... There may be a solemn duty; and if it come we must\\nnot shrink from it.... I shall be prepared. I shall get my typewriter\\nthis very hour and begin transcribing. Then we shall be ready for other\\neyes if required. And if it be wanted; then, perhaps, if I am ready,\\npoor Jonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for him and never let\\nhim be troubled or worried with it at all.

That is the reason of his coming; it is concerning Lucy and her\\nsleep-walking, and not about Jonathan. Then I shall never know the real\\ntruth now! How silly I am. That awful journal gets hold of my\\nimagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour. Of\\ncourse it is about Lucy. That habit came back to the poor dear, and that\\nawful night on the cliff must have made her ill. I had almost forgotten\\nin my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. She must have told him\\nof her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew all about\\nit; and now he wants me to tell him what she knows, so that he may\\nunderstand. I hope I did right in not saying anything of it to Mrs.\\nWestenra; I should never forgive myself if any act of mine, were it even\\na negative one, brought harm on poor dear Lucy. I hope, too, Dr. Van\\nHelsing will not blame me; I have had so much trouble and anxiety of\\nlate that I feel I cannot bear more just at present.\\n\\nI suppose a cry does us all good at times--clears the air as other rain\\ndoes. Perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me, and\\nthen Jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole day\\nand night, the first time we have been parted since our marriage. I do\\nhope the dear fellow will take care of himself, and that nothing will\\noccur to upset him. It is two o’clock, and the doctor will be here soon\\nnow. I shall say nothing of Jonathan’s journal unless he asks me. I am\\nso glad I have type-written out my own journal, so that, in case he asks\\nabout Lucy, I can hand it to him; it will save much questioning.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later._--He has come and gone. Oh, what a strange meeting, and how it\\nall makes my head whirl round! I feel like one in a dream. Can it be all\\npossible, or even a part of it? If I had not read Jonathan’s journal\\nfirst, I should never have accepted even a possibility. Poor, poor, dear\\nJonathan! How he must have suffered. Please the good God, all this may\\nnot upset him again. I shall try to save him from it; but it may be even\\na consolation and a help to him--terrible though it be and awful in its\\nconsequences--to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did\\nnot deceive him, and that it is all true. It may be that it is the doubt\\nwhich haunts him; that when the doubt is removed, no matter\\nwhich--waking or dreaming--may prove the truth, he will be more\\nsatisfied and better able to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing must be a\\ngood man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur’s friend and Dr.\\nSeward’s, and if they brought him all the way from Holland to look after\\nLucy. I feel from having seen him that he _is_ good and kind and of a\\nnoble nature. When he comes to-morrow I shall ask him about Jonathan;\\nand then, please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good\\nend. I used to think I would like to practise interviewing; Jonathan’s\\nfriend on “The Exeter News” told him that memory was everything in such\\nwork--that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word\\nspoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards. Here was a rare\\ninterview; I shall try to record it _verbatim_.\\n\\nIt was half-past two o’clock when the knock came. I took my courage _à\\ndeux mains_ and waited. In a few minutes Mary opened the door, and\\nannounced “Dr. Van Helsing.”\\n\\nI rose and bowed, and he came towards me; a man of medium weight,\\nstrongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest and\\na neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. The poise\\nof the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power; the\\nhead is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears. The face,\\nclean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large, resolute, mobile\\nmouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitive\\nnostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come down and the\\nmouth tightens. The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almost\\nstraight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart;\\nsuch a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it,\\nbut falls naturally back and to the sides. Big, dark blue eyes are set\\nwidely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man’s moods. He\\nsaid to me:--\\n\\n“Mrs. Harker, is it not?” I bowed assent.\\n\\n“That was Miss Mina Murray?” Again I assented.\\n\\n“It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor dear\\nchild Lucy Westenra. Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead I come.”\\n\\n“Sir,” I said, “you could have no better claim on me than that you were\\na friend and helper of Lucy Westenra.” And I held out my hand. He took\\nit and said tenderly:--\\n\\n“Oh, Madam Mina, I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be\\ngood, but I had yet to learn----” He finished his speech with a courtly\\nbow. I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so he at\\nonce began:--\\n\\n“I have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but I had to begin\\nto inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. I know that you were\\nwith her at Whitby. She sometimes kept a diary--you need not look\\nsurprised, Madam Mina; it was begun after you had left, and was in\\nimitation of you--and in that diary she traces by inference certain\\nthings to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her. In\\ngreat perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so much\\nkindness to tell me all of it that you can remember.”\\n\\n“I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it.”\\n\\n“Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details? It is not always\\nso with young ladies.”\\n\\n“No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can show it to you\\nif you like.”\\n\\n“Oh, Madam Mina, I will be grateful; you will do me much favour.” I\\ncould not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit--I suppose it is\\nsome of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our\\nmouths--so I handed him the shorthand diary. He took it with a grateful\\nbow, and said:--\\n\\n“May I read it?”\\n\\n“If you wish,” I answered as demurely as I could. He opened it, and for\\nan instant his face fell. Then he stood up and bowed.\\n\\n“Oh, you so clever woman!” he said. “I knew long that Mr. Jonathan was a\\nman of much thankfulness; but see, his wife have all the good things.\\nAnd will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me?\\nAlas! I know not the shorthand.” By this time my little joke was over,\\nand I was almost ashamed; so I took the typewritten copy from my\\nworkbasket and handed it to him.\\n\\n“Forgive me,” I said: “I could not help it; but I had been thinking that\\nit was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might not\\nhave time to wait--not on my account, but because I know your time must\\nbe precious--I have written it out on the typewriter for you.”\\n\\nHe took it and his eyes glistened. “You are so good,” he said. “And may\\nI read it now? I may want to ask you some things when I have read.”\\n\\n“By all means,” I said, “read it over whilst I order lunch; and then you\\ncan ask me questions whilst we eat.” He bowed and settled himself in a\\nchair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers,\\nwhilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be\\ndisturbed. When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up and down\\nthe room, his face all ablaze with excitement. He rushed up to me and\\ntook me by both hands.\\n\\n“Oh, Madam Mina,” he said, “how can I say what I owe to you? This paper\\nis as sunshine. It opens the gate to me. I am daze, I am dazzle, with so\\nmuch light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time. But that\\nyou do not, cannot, comprehend. Oh, but I am grateful to you, you so\\nclever woman. Madam”--he said this very solemnly--“if ever Abraham Van\\nHelsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know.\\nIt will be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend; as a\\nfriend, but all I have ever learned, all I can ever do, shall be for you\\nand those you love. There are darknesses in life, and there are lights;\\nyou are one of the lights. You will have happy life and good life, and\\nyour husband will be blessed in you.”\\n\\n“But, doctor, you praise me too much, and--and you do not know me.”\\n\\n“Not know you--I, who am old, and who have studied all my life men and\\nwomen; I, who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to\\nhim and all that follow from him! And I have read your diary that you\\nhave so goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in every\\nline. I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of your\\nmarriage and your trust, not know you! Oh, Madam Mina, good women tell\\nall their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such things that\\nangels can read; and we men who wish to know have in us something of\\nangels’ eyes. Your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too, for\\nyou trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature. And your\\nhusband--tell me of him. Is he quite well? Is all that fever gone, and\\nis he strong and hearty?” I saw here an opening to ask him about\\nJonathan, so I said:--\\n\\n“He was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset by Mr. Hawkins’s\\ndeath.” He interrupted:--\\n\\n“Oh, yes, I know, I know. I have read your last two letters.” I went\\non:--\\n\\n“I suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on Thursday last he\\nhad a sort of shock.”\\n\\n“A shock, and after brain fever so soon! That was not good. What kind of\\na shock was it?”\\n\\n“He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible, something\\nwhich led to his brain fever.” And here the whole thing seemed to\\noverwhelm me in a rush. The pity for Jonathan, the horror which he\\nexperienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that\\nhas been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult. I suppose I\\nwas hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to\\nhim, and implored him to make my husband well again. He took my hands\\nand raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me; he held my\\nhand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness:--\\n\\n“My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have not\\nhad much time for friendships; but since I have been summoned to here by\\nmy friend John Seward I have known so many good people and seen such\\nnobility that I feel more than ever--and it has grown with my advancing\\nyears--the loneliness of my life. Believe, me, then, that I come here\\nfull of respect for you, and you have given me hope--hope, not in what I\\nam seeking of, but that there are good women still left to make life\\nhappy--good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for\\nthe children that are to be. I am glad, glad, that I may here be of some\\nuse to you; for if your husband suffer, he suffer within the range of my\\nstudy and experience. I promise you that I will gladly do _all_ for him\\nthat I can--all to make his life strong and manly, and your life a happy\\none. Now you must eat. You are overwrought and perhaps over-anxious.\\nHusband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale; and what he like not\\nwhere he love, is not to his good. Therefore for his sake you must eat\\nand smile. You have told me all about Lucy, and so now we shall not\\nspeak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in Exeter to-night, for I\\nwant to think much over what you have told me, and when I have thought I\\nwill ask you questions, if I may. And then, too, you will tell me of\\nhusband Jonathan’s trouble so far as you can, but not yet. You must eat\\nnow; afterwards you shall tell me all.”\\n\\nAfter lunch, when we went back to the drawing-room, he said to me:--\\n\\n“And now tell me all about him.” When it came to speaking to this great\\nlearned man, I began to fear that he would think me a weak fool, and\\nJonathan a madman--that journal is all so strange--and I hesitated to go\\non. But he was so sweet and kind, and he had promised to help, and I\\ntrusted him, so I said:--\\n\\n“Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer that you must not\\nlaugh at me or at my husband. I have been since yesterday in a sort of\\nfever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that I\\nhave even half believed some very strange things.” He reassured me by\\nhis manner as well as his words when he said:--\\n\\n“Oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which\\nI am here, it is you who would laugh. I have learned not to think little\\nof any one’s belief, no matter how strange it be. I have tried to keep\\nan open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close\\nit, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things that\\nmake one doubt if they be mad or sane.”\\n\\n“Thank you, thank you, a thousand times! You have taken a weight off my\\nmind. If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read. It is long,\\nbut I have typewritten it out. It will tell you my trouble and\\nJonathan’s. It is the copy of his journal when abroad, and all that\\nhappened. I dare not say anything of it; you will read for yourself and\\njudge. And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and tell\\nme what you think.”\\n\\n“I promise,” he said as I gave him the papers; “I shall in the morning,\\nso soon as I can, come to see you and your husband, if I may.”\\n\\n“Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to lunch\\nwith us and see him then; you could catch the quick 3:34 train, which\\nwill leave you at Paddington before eight.” He was surprised at my\\nknowledge of the trains off-hand, but he does not know that I have made\\nup all the trains to and from Exeter, so that I may help Jonathan in\\ncase he is in a hurry.\\n\\nSo he took the papers with him and went away, and I sit here\\nthinking--thinking I don’t know what.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Letter (by hand), Van Helsing to Mrs. Harker._\\n\\n“_25 September, 6 o’clock._\\n\\n“Dear Madam Mina,--\\n\\n“I have read your husband’s so wonderful diary.

And yet, if it be true, what terrible things there are in\\nthe world, and what an awful thing if that man, that monster, be really\\nin London! I fear to think. I have this moment, whilst writing, had a\\nwire from Jonathan, saying that he leaves by the 6:25 to-night from\\nLaunceston and will be here at 10:18, so that I shall have no fear\\nto-night. Will you, therefore, instead of lunching with us, please come\\nto breakfast at eight o’clock, if this be not too early for you? You can\\nget away, if you are in a hurry, by the 10:30 train, which will bring\\nyou to Paddington by 2:35. Do not answer this, as I shall take it that,\\nif I do not hear, you will come to breakfast.\\n\\n“Believe me,\\n\\n“Your faithful and grateful friend,\\n\\n“MINA HARKER.”\\n\\n\\n_Jonathan Harker’s Journal._\\n\\n_26 September._--I thought never to write in this diary again, but the\\ntime has come. When I got home last night Mina had supper ready, and\\nwhen we had supped she told me of Van Helsing’s visit, and of her having\\ngiven him the two diaries copied out, and of how anxious she has been\\nabout me. She showed me in the doctor’s letter that all I wrote down was\\ntrue. It seems to have made a new man of me. It was the doubt as to the\\nreality of the whole thing that knocked me over. I felt impotent, and in\\nthe dark, and distrustful. But, now that I _know_, I am not afraid, even\\nof the Count. He has succeeded after all, then, in his design in getting\\nto London, and it was he I saw. He has got younger, and how? Van Helsing\\nis the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is anything like what\\nMina says. We sat late, and talked it all over. Mina is dressing, and I\\nshall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over....\\n\\nHe was, I think, surprised to see me. When I came into the room where he\\nwas, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder, and turned my\\nface round to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny:--\\n\\n“But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock.” It was\\nso funny to hear my wife called “Madam Mina” by this kindly,\\nstrong-faced old man. I smiled, and said:--\\n\\n“I _was_ ill, I _have_ had a shock; but you have cured me already.”\\n\\n“And how?”\\n\\n“By your letter to Mina last night. I was in doubt, and then everything\\ntook a hue of unreality, and I did not know what to trust, even the\\nevidence of my own senses. Not knowing what to trust, I did not know\\nwhat to do; and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been\\nthe groove of my life. The groove ceased to avail me, and I mistrusted\\nmyself. Doctor, you don’t know what it is to doubt everything, even\\nyourself. No, you don’t; you couldn’t with eyebrows like yours.” He\\nseemed pleased, and laughed as he said:--\\n\\n“So! You are physiognomist. I learn more here with each hour. I am with\\nso much pleasure coming to you to breakfast; and, oh, sir, you will\\npardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife.” I\\nwould listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I simply nodded\\nand stood silent.\\n\\n“She is one of God’s women, fashioned by His own hand to show us men and\\nother women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its\\nlight can be here on earth. So true, so sweet, so noble, so little an\\negoist--and that, let me tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical and\\nselfish. And you, sir--I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy,\\nand some of them speak of you, so I know you since some days from the\\nknowing of others; but I have seen your true self since last night. You\\nwill give me your hand, will you not? And let us be friends for all our\\nlives.”\\n\\nWe shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quite\\nchoky.\\n\\n“And now,” he said, “may I ask you for some more help? I have a great\\ntask to do, and at the beginning it is to know. You can help me here.\\nCan you tell me what went before your going to Transylvania? Later on I\\nmay ask more help, and of a different kind; but at first this will do.”\\n\\n“Look here, sir,” I said, “does what you have to do concern the Count?”\\n\\n“It does,” he said solemnly.\\n\\n“Then I am with you heart and soul. As you go by the 10:30 train, you\\nwill not have time to read them; but I shall get the bundle of papers.\\nYou can take them with you and read them in the train.”\\n\\nAfter breakfast I saw him to the station. When we were parting he\\nsaid:--\\n\\n“Perhaps you will come to town if I send to you, and take Madam Mina\\ntoo.”\\n\\n“We shall both come when you will,” I said.\\n\\nI had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the previous\\nnight, and while we were talking at the carriage window, waiting for the\\ntrain to start, he was turning them over. His eyes suddenly seemed to\\ncatch something in one of them, “The Westminster Gazette”--I knew it by\\nthe colour--and he grew quite white. He read something intently,\\ngroaning to himself: “Mein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon! so soon!” I do not\\nthink he remembered me at the moment. Just then the whistle blew, and\\nthe train moved off. This recalled him to himself, and he leaned out of\\nthe window and waved his hand, calling out: “Love to Madam Mina; I shall\\nwrite so soon as ever I can.”\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n_26 September._--Truly there is no such thing as finality. Not a week\\nsince I said “Finis,” and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rather\\ngoing on with the same record. Until this afternoon I had no cause to\\nthink of what is done. Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane as\\nhe ever was. He was already well ahead with his fly business; and he had\\njust started in the spider line also; so he had not been of any trouble\\nto me. I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, and from it I\\ngather that he is bearing up wonderfully well. Quincey Morris is with\\nhim, and that is much of a help, for he himself is a bubbling well of\\ngood spirits. Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that\\nArthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy; so as to\\nthem all my mind is at rest. As for myself, I was settling down to my\\nwork with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it, so that I might\\nfairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy left on me was becoming\\ncicatrised. Everything is, however, now reopened; and what is to be the\\nend God only knows. I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows,\\ntoo, but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity. He\\nwent to Exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night. To-day he came\\nback, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o’clock,\\nand thrust last night’s “Westminster Gazette” into my hand.\\n\\n“What do you think of that?” he asked as he stood back and folded his\\narms.\\n\\nI looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant; but he\\ntook it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyed\\naway at Hampstead. It did not convey much to me, until I reached a\\npassage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats. An\\nidea struck me, and I looked up. “Well?” he said.\\n\\n“It is like poor Lucy’s.”\\n\\n“And what do you make of it?”\\n\\n“Simply that there is some cause in common. Whatever it was that injured\\nher has injured them.” I did not quite understand his answer:--\\n\\n“That is true indirectly, but not directly.”\\n\\n“How do you mean, Professor?” I asked. I was a little inclined to take\\nhis seriousness lightly--for, after all, four days of rest and freedom\\nfrom burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one’s spirits--but\\nwhen I saw his face, it sobered me. Never, even in the midst of our\\ndespair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern.\\n\\n“Tell me!” I said. “I can hazard no opinion. I do not know what to\\nthink, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture.”\\n\\n“Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion as to\\nwhat poor Lucy died of; not after all the hints given, not only by\\nevents, but by me?”\\n\\n“Of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood.”\\n\\n“And how the blood lost or waste?” I shook my head. He stepped over and\\nsat down beside me, and went on:--\\n\\n“You are clever man, friend John; you reason well, and your wit is bold;\\nbut you are too prejudiced. You do not let your eyes see nor your ears\\nhear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to\\nyou. Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand,\\nand yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? But\\nthere are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men’s\\neyes, because they know--or think they know--some things which other men\\nhave told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to\\nexplain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to\\nexplain. But yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs,\\nwhich think themselves new; and which are yet but the old, which pretend\\nto be young--like the fine ladies at the opera. I suppose now you do not\\nbelieve in corporeal transference. No? Nor in materialisation. No? Nor\\nin astral bodies. No? Nor in the reading of thought. No? Nor in\\nhypnotism----”\\n\\n“Yes,” I said. “Charcot has proved that pretty well.” He smiled as he\\nwent on: “Then you are satisfied as to it. Yes? And of course then you\\nunderstand how it act, and can follow the mind of the great\\nCharcot--alas that he is no more!--into the very soul of the patient\\nthat he influence. No? Then, friend John, am I to take it that you\\nsimply accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion\\nbe a blank? No? Then tell me--for I am student of the brain--how you\\naccept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading. Let me tell you, my\\nfriend, that there are things done to-day in electrical science which\\nwould have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered\\nelectricity--who would themselves not so long before have been burned\\nas wizards. There are always mysteries in life. Why was it that\\nMethuselah lived nine hundred years, and ‘Old Parr’ one hundred and\\nsixty-nine, and yet that poor Lucy, with four men’s blood in her poor\\nveins, could not live even one day? For, had she live one more day, we\\ncould have save her. Do you know all the mystery of life and death? Do\\nyou know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the\\nqualities of brutes are in some men, and not in others? Can you tell me\\nwhy, when other spiders die small and soon, that one great spider lived\\nfor centuries in the tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew,\\ntill, on descending, he could drink the oil of all the church lamps? Can\\nyou tell me why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are bats that\\ncome at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their\\nveins; how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats which hang\\non the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as like giant\\nnuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because that\\nit is hot, flit down on them, and then--and then in the morning are\\nfound dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?”\\n\\n“Good God, Professor!” I said, starting up. “Do you mean to tell me that\\nLucy was bitten by such a bat; and that such a thing is here in London\\nin the nineteenth century?” He waved his hand for silence, and went\\non:--\\n\\n“Can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of\\nmen; why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties; and\\nwhy the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint?\\nCan you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there are\\nsome few who live on always if they be permit; that there are men and\\nwomen who cannot die? We all know--because science has vouched for the\\nfact--that there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of\\nyears, shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of\\nthe world. Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make himself to die\\nand have been buried, and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it, and the\\ncorn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again, and then men\\ncome and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the Indian\\nfakir, not dead, but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?” Here\\nI interrupted him. I was getting bewildered; he so crowded on my mind\\nhis list of nature’s eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my\\nimagination was getting fired. I had a dim idea that he was teaching me\\nsome lesson, as long ago he used to do in his study at Amsterdam; but\\nhe used then to tell me the thing, so that I could have the object of\\nthought in mind all the time. But now I was without this help, yet I\\nwanted to follow him, so I said:--\\n\\n“Professor, let me be your pet student again. Tell me the thesis, so\\nthat I may apply your knowledge as you go on. At present I am going in\\nmy mind from point to point as a mad man, and not a sane one, follows an\\nidea. I feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a mist, jumping\\nfrom one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without\\nknowing where I am going.”\\n\\n“That is good image,” he said. “Well, I shall tell you. My thesis is\\nthis: I want you to believe.”\\n\\n“To believe what?”\\n\\n“To believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrate. I heard once\\nof an American who so defined faith: ‘that faculty which enables us to\\nbelieve things which we know to be untrue.’ For one, I follow that man.\\nHe meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit of\\ntruth check the rush of a big truth, like a small rock does a railway\\ntruck. We get the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we value\\nhim; but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in\\nthe universe.”\\n\\n“Then you want me not to let some previous conviction injure the\\nreceptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter. Do I read\\nyour lesson aright?”\\n\\n“Ah, you are my favourite pupil still. It is worth to teach you. Now\\nthat you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to\\nunderstand. You think then that those so small holes in the children’s\\nthroats were made by the same that made the hole in Miss Lucy?”\\n\\n“I suppose so.” He stood up and said solemnly:--\\n\\n“Then you are wrong. Oh, would it were so! but alas! no. It is worse,\\nfar, far worse.”\\n\\n“In God’s name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?” I cried.\\n\\nHe threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed his\\nelbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke:--\\n\\n“They were made by Miss Lucy!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\nDR. SEWARD’S DIARY--_continued_.\\n\\n\\nFor a while sheer anger mastered me; it was as if he had during her life\\nstruck Lucy on the face. I smote the table hard and rose up as I said to\\nhim:--\\n\\n“Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?” He raised his head and looked at me, and\\nsomehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once. “Would I were!” he\\nsaid. “Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this. Oh, my\\nfriend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell\\nyou so simple a thing? Was it because I hate you and have hated you all\\nmy life? Was it because I wished to give you pain? Was it that I wanted,\\nnow so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a\\nfearful death? Ah no!”\\n\\n“Forgive me,” said I. He went on:--\\n\\n“My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to you,\\nfor I know you have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet I do not\\nexpect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract\\ntruth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always\\nbelieved the ‘no’ of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a\\nconcrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy. To-night I go to prove\\nit. Dare you come with me?”\\n\\nThis staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth; Byron\\nexcepted from the category, jealousy.\\n\\n    “And prove the very truth he most abhorred.”\\n\\nHe saw my hesitation, and spoke:--\\n\\n“The logic is simple, no madman’s logic this time, jumping from tussock\\nto tussock in a misty bog. If it be not true, then proof will be relief;\\nat worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the dread; yet\\nvery dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come,\\nI tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and see that child\\nin the hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers\\nsay the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were\\nin class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, if he\\nwill not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing, but only that we\\nwish to learn. And then----”\\n\\n“And then?” He took a key from his pocket and held it up. “And then we\\nspend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This is\\nthe key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin-man to give to\\nArthur.” My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful\\nordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what\\nheart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was\\npassing....\\n\\nWe found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, and\\naltogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its\\nthroat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the\\nsimilarity to those which had been on Lucy’s throat. They were smaller,\\nand the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what he\\nattributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some\\nanimal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to think\\nthat it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern\\nheights of London. “Out of so many harmless ones,” he said, “there may\\nbe some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some\\nsailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from\\nthe Zoölogical Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred\\nthere from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days ago\\na wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For a\\nweek after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the\\nHeath and in every alley in the place until this ‘bloofer lady’ scare\\ncame along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them. Even\\nthis poor little mite, when he woke up to-day, asked the nurse if he\\nmight go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted\\nto play with the ‘bloofer lady.’”\\n\\n“I hope,” said Van Helsing, “that when you are sending the child home\\nyou will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These fancies\\nto stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out another\\nnight, it would probably be fatal. But in any case I suppose you will\\nnot let it away for some days?”\\n\\n“Certainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is not\\nhealed.”\\n\\nOur visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and\\nthe sun had dipped before we came out. When Van Helsing saw how dark it\\nwas, he said:--\\n\\n“There is no hurry. It is more late than I thought. Come, let us seek\\nsomewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way.”\\n\\nWe dined at “Jack Straw’s Castle” along with a little crowd of\\nbicyclists and others who were genially noisy. About ten o’clock we\\nstarted from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps\\nmade the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual\\nradius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he\\nwent on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to\\nlocality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at\\nlast we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse\\npolice going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall of\\nthe churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty--for\\nit was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us--we found\\nthe Westenra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door,\\nand standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to\\nprecede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the\\ncourtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. My\\ncompanion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after\\ncarefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring,\\none. In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then he\\nfumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle,\\nproceeded to make a light. The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed\\nwith fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, some\\ndays afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites\\nturning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the\\nbeetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured\\nstone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished\\nbrass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a\\ncandle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been\\nimagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life--animal life--was\\nnot the only thing which could pass away.\\n\\nVan Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle so\\nthat he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm\\ndropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he\\nmade assurance of Lucy’s coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took\\nout a turnscrew.\\n\\n“What are you going to do?” I asked.\\n\\n“To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced.” Straightway he began\\ntaking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the\\ncasing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemed\\nto be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have\\nstripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took\\nhold of his hand to stop him. He only said: “You shall see,” and again\\nfumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrew\\nthrough the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he\\nmade a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of\\nthe saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. We\\ndoctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to\\nsuch things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor never\\nstopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of\\nthe lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking the\\nedge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the\\ncoffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to\\nlook.\\n\\nI drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.\\n\\nIt was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but\\nVan Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever of his ground,\\nand so emboldened to proceed in his task. “Are you satisfied now, friend\\nJohn?” he asked.\\n\\nI felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as\\nI answered him:--\\n\\n“I am satisfied that Lucy’s body is not in that coffin; but that only\\nproves one thing.”\\n\\n“And what is that, friend John?”\\n\\n“That it is not there.”\\n\\n“That is good logic,” he said, “so far as it goes. But how do you--how\\ncan you--account for it not being there?”\\n\\n“Perhaps a body-snatcher,” I suggested. “Some of the undertaker’s people\\nmay have stolen it.” I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was\\nthe only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. “Ah\\nwell!” he said, “we must have more proof. Come with me.”\\n\\nHe put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed\\nthem in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the\\nbag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and\\nlocked it. He handed me the key, saying: “Will you keep it? You had\\nbetter be assured.” I laughed--it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am\\nbound to say--as I motioned him to keep it. “A key is nothing,” I said;\\n“there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock\\nof that kind.” He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he\\ntold me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at\\nthe other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark\\nfigure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my\\nsight.\\n\\nIt was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant\\nclock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was chilled and\\nunnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand\\nand with myself for coming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly\\nobservant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I had\\na dreary, miserable time.\\n\\nSuddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white\\nstreak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard\\nfarthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the\\nProfessor’s side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I\\ntoo moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and I\\nstumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an\\nearly cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scattered\\njuniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim\\nfigure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden\\nby trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I heard the\\nrustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and\\ncoming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child. When\\nhe saw me he held it out to me, and said:--\\n\\n“Are you satisfied now?”\\n\\n“No,” I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.\\n\\n“Do you not see the child?”\\n\\n“Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?” I\\nasked.\\n\\n“We shall see,” said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way\\nout of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.\\n\\nWhen we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of\\ntrees, and struck a match, and looked at the child’s throat. It was\\nwithout a scratch or scar of any kind.\\n\\n“Was I right?” I asked triumphantly.\\n\\n“We were just in time,” said the Professor thankfully.\\n\\nWe had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted\\nabout it. If we were to take it to a police-station we should have to\\ngive some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should\\nhave had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child.\\nSo finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we\\nheard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find\\nit; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. All fell out\\nwell. At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman’s heavy\\ntramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until\\nhe saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamation\\nof astonishment, and then we went away silently. By good chance we got a\\ncab near the “Spaniards,” and drove to town.\\n\\nI cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours’\\nsleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists that I shall\\ngo with him on another expedition.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_27 September._--It was two o’clock before we found a suitable\\nopportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed,\\nand the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily\\naway, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we saw\\nthe sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe till\\nmorning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should not\\nwant more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense of the\\nreality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of\\nplace; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were\\nincurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless.\\nOutrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead\\nnearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to\\nopen the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own\\neyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however,\\nand rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road,\\nno matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again\\ncourteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome as\\nlast night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine\\nstreamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy’s coffin, and I followed.\\nHe bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock\\nof surprise and dismay shot through me.\\n\\nThere lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her\\nfuneral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I\\ncould not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than\\nbefore; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.\\n\\n“Is this a juggle?” I said to him.\\n\\n“Are you convinced now?” said the Professor in response, and as he spoke\\nhe put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the\\ndead lips and showed the white teeth.\\n\\n“See,” he went on, “see, they are even sharper than before. With this\\nand this”--and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below\\nit--“the little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friend\\nJohn?” Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I _could_ not\\naccept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt to\\nargue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:--\\n\\n“She may have been placed here since last night.”\\n\\n“Indeed? That is so, and by whom?”\\n\\n“I do not know. Some one has done it.”\\n\\n“And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would not\\nlook so.” I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van Helsing did not\\nseem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor\\ntriumph. He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising\\nthe eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and\\nexamining the teeth. Then he turned to me and said:--\\n\\n“Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here is\\nsome dual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the vampire\\nwhen she was in a trance, sleep-walking--oh, you start; you do not know\\nthat, friend John, but you shall know it all later--and in trance could\\nhe best come to take more blood. In trance she died, and in trance she\\nis Un-Dead, too. So it is that she differ from all other. Usually when\\nthe Un-Dead sleep at home”--as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of\\nhis arm to designate what to a vampire was “home”--“their face show what\\nthey are, but this so sweet that was when she not Un-Dead she go back to\\nthe nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and so\\nit make hard that I must kill her in her sleep.” This turned my blood\\ncold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing’s\\ntheories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the\\nidea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in\\nmy face, for he said almost joyously:--\\n\\n“Ah, you believe now?”\\n\\nI answered: “Do not press me too hard all at once. I am willing to\\naccept. How will you do this bloody work?”\\n\\n“I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall\\ndrive a stake through her body.” It made me shudder to think of so\\nmutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the feeling\\nwas not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning to\\nshudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing\\ncalled it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective,\\nor all objective?\\n\\nI waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as\\nif wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a\\nsnap, and said:--\\n\\n“I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If I\\ndid simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what is\\nto be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that are\\nthousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This is\\nsimple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act\\nnow would be to take danger from her for ever. But then we may have to\\nwant Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? If you, who saw the\\nwounds on Lucy’s throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child’s at\\nthe hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full\\nto-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more\\nbeautiful in a whole week, after she die--if you know of this and know\\nof the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard,\\nand yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect\\nArthur, who know none of those things, to believe? He doubted me when I\\ntook him from her kiss when she was dying. I know he has forgiven me\\nbecause in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say\\ngood-bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken idea\\nthis woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have\\nkilled her. He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that\\nhave killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy always. Yet\\nhe never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. And he will\\nsometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint\\nhis dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and again, he\\nwill think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all,\\nan Un-Dead. No! I told him once, and since then I learn much. Now, since\\nI know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he\\nmust pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet. He, poor fellow,\\nmust have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to\\nhim; then we can act for good all round and send him peace. My mind is\\nmade up. Let us go. You return home for to-night to your asylum, and see\\nthat all be well. As for me, I shall spend the night here in this\\nchurchyard in my own way. To-morrow night you will come to me to the\\nBerkeley Hotel at ten of the clock. I shall send for Arthur to come too,\\nand also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood. Later we\\nshall all have work to do. I come with you so far as Piccadilly and\\nthere dine, for I must be back here before the sun set.”\\n\\nSo we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the\\nchurchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly.\\n\\n\\n_Note left by Van Helsing in his portmanteau, Berkeley Hotel directed to\\nJohn Seward, M. D._\\n\\n(Not delivered.)\\n\\n“_27 September._\\n\\n“Friend John,--\\n\\n“I write this in case anything should happen. I go alone to watch in\\nthat churchyard. It pleases me that the Un-Dead, Miss Lucy, shall not\\nleave to-night, that so on the morrow night she may be more eager.\\nTherefore I shall fix some things she like not--garlic and a\\ncrucifix--and so seal up the door of the tomb. She is young as Un-Dead,\\nand will heed. Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out; they\\nmay not prevail on her wanting to get in; for then the Un-Dead is\\ndesperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it may\\nbe. I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise,\\nand if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it. For Miss\\nLucy or from her, I have no fear; but that other to whom is there that\\nshe is Un-Dead, he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter.\\nHe is cunning, as I know from Mr. Jonathan and from the way that all\\nalong he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy’s life, and\\nwe lost; and in many ways the Un-Dead are strong. He have always the\\nstrength in his hand of twenty men; even we four who gave our strength\\nto Miss Lucy it also is all to him. Besides, he can summon his wolf and\\nI know not what. So if it be that he come thither on this night he shall\\nfind me; but none other shall--until it be too late. But it may be that\\nhe will not attempt the place. There is no reason why he should; his\\nhunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the\\nUn-Dead woman sleep, and the one old man watch.\\n\\n“Therefore I write this in case.... Take the papers that are with this,\\nthe diaries of Harker and the rest, and read them, and then find this\\ngreat Un-Dead, and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake\\nthrough it, so that the world may rest from him.\\n\\n“If it be so, farewell.\\n\\n“VAN HELSING.”\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n_28 September._--It is wonderful what a good night’s sleep will do for\\none. Yesterday I was almost willing to accept Van Helsing’s monstrous\\nideas; but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on\\ncommon sense. I have no doubt that he believes it all. I wonder if his\\nmind can have become in any way unhinged. Surely there must be _some_\\nrational explanation of all these mysterious things. Is it possible that\\nthe Professor can have done it himself? He is so abnormally clever that\\nif he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to\\nsome fixed idea in a wonderful way. I am loath to think it, and indeed\\nit would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that Van\\nHelsing was mad; but anyhow I shall watch him carefully. I may get some\\nlight on the mystery.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_29 September, morning._.... Last night, at a little before ten o’clock,\\nArthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing’s room; he told us all that he\\nwanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if all\\nour wills were centred in his. He began by saying that he hoped we would\\nall come with him too, “for,” he said, “there is a grave duty to be done\\nthere. You were doubtless surprised at my letter?” This query was\\ndirectly addressed to Lord Godalming.\\n\\n“I was. It rather upset me for a bit. There has been so much trouble\\naround my house of late that I could do without any more. I have been\\ncurious, too, as to what you mean. Quincey and I talked it over; but the\\nmore we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself\\nthat I’m about up a tree as to any meaning about anything.”\\n\\n“Me too,” said Quincey Morris laconically.\\n\\n“Oh,” said the Professor, “then you are nearer the beginning, both of\\nyou, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he can\\neven get so far as to begin.”\\n\\nIt was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame of\\nmind without my saying a word. Then, turning to the other two, he said\\nwith intense gravity:--\\n\\n“I want your permission to do what I think good this night. It is, I\\nknow, much to ask; and when you know what it is I propose to do you will\\nknow, and only then, how much. Therefore may I ask that you promise me\\nin the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry with me for a\\ntime--I must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may\\nbe--you shall not blame yourselves for anything.”\\n\\n“That’s frank anyhow,” broke in Quincey. “I’ll answer for the Professor.\\nI don’t quite see his drift, but I swear he’s honest; and that’s good\\nenough for me.”\\n\\n“I thank you, sir,” said Van Helsing proudly. “I have done myself the\\nhonour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dear\\nto me.” He held out a hand, which Quincey took.\\n\\nThen Arthur spoke out:--\\n\\n“Dr. Van Helsing, I don’t quite like to ‘buy a pig in a poke,’ as they\\nsay in Scotland, and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman\\nor my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a promise.\\nIf you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of\\nthese two, then I give my consent at once; though for the life of me, I\\ncannot understand what you are driving at.”\\n\\n“I accept your limitation,” said Van Helsing, “and all I ask of you is\\nthat if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will first\\nconsider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your\\nreservations.”\\n\\n“Agreed!” said Arthur; “that is only fair. And now that the\\n_pourparlers_ are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?”\\n\\n“I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard at\\nKingstead.”\\n\\nArthur’s face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way:--\\n\\n“Where poor Lucy is buried?” The Professor bowed. Arthur went on: “And\\nwhen there?”\\n\\n“To enter the tomb!” Arthur stood up.\\n\\n“Professor, are you in earnest; or it is some monstrous joke? Pardon me,\\nI see that you are in earnest.” He sat down again, but I could see that\\nhe sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. There was\\nsilence until he asked again:--\\n\\n“And when in the tomb?”\\n\\n“To open the coffin.”\\n\\n“This is too much!” he said, angrily rising again. “I am willing to be\\npatient in all things that are reasonable; but in this--this desecration\\nof the grave--of one who----” He fairly choked with indignation. The\\nProfessor looked pityingly at him.\\n\\n“If I could spare you one pang, my poor friend,” he said, “God knows I\\nwould. But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths; or later, and\\nfor ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!”\\n\\nArthur looked up with set white face and said:--\\n\\n“Take care, sir, take care!”\\n\\n“Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?” said Van Helsing.\\n“And then you will at least know the limit of my purpose. Shall I go\\non?”\\n\\n“That’s fair enough,” broke in Morris.\\n\\nAfter a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an effort:--\\n\\n“Miss Lucy is dead; is it not so? Yes! Then there can be no wrong to\\nher. But if she be not dead----”\\n\\nArthur jumped to his feet.\\n\\n“Good God!” he cried. “What do you mean? Has there been any mistake; has\\nshe been buried alive?” He groaned in anguish that not even hope could\\nsoften.\\n\\n“I did not say she was alive, my child; I did not think it. I go no\\nfurther than to say that she might be Un-Dead.”\\n\\n“Un-Dead! Not alive! What do you mean? Is this all a nightmare, or what\\nis it?”\\n\\n“There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they\\nmay solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one. But\\nI have not done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?”\\n\\n“Heavens and earth, no!” cried Arthur in a storm of passion. “Not for\\nthe wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body. Dr.\\nVan Helsing, you try me too far. What have I done to you that you should\\ntorture me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to\\ncast such dishonour on her grave? Are you mad to speak such things, or\\nam I mad to listen to them? Don’t dare to think more of such a\\ndesecration; I shall not give my consent to anything you do. I have a\\nduty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall do\\nit!”\\n\\nVan Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and\\nsaid, gravely and sternly:--\\n\\n“My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty\\nto you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it! All I ask you\\nnow is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if when\\nlater I make the same request you do not be more eager for its\\nfulfilment even than I am, then--then I shall do my duty, whatever it\\nmay seem to me. And then, to follow of your Lordship’s wishes I shall\\nhold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where\\nyou will.” His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice full of\\npity:--\\n\\n“But, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. In a long life of\\nacts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring\\nmy heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that if\\nthe time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from\\nyou will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can\\nto save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself so\\nmuch of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land\\nto do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, and\\nthen to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her--I\\nam ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness--I gave what you\\ngave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her\\nlover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights\\nand days--before death, after death; and if my death can do her good\\neven now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely.” He\\nsaid this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected\\nby it. He took the old man’s hand and said in a broken voice:--\\n\\n“Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I\\nshall go with you and wait.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\nDR. SEWARD’S DIARY--_continued_\\n\\n\\nIt was just a quarter before twelve o’clock when we got into the\\nchurchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleams\\nof moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across\\nthe sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly\\nin front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I looked\\nwell at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so\\nsorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took it\\nthat the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant\\nto his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural\\nhesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by\\nentering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door.\\nHe then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur stepped\\nforward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:--\\n\\n“You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that\\ncoffin?”\\n\\n“It was.” The Professor turned to the rest saying:--\\n\\n“You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me.” He\\ntook his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur\\nlooked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped\\nforward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or,\\nat any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead,\\nthe blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away\\nagain, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent.\\nVan Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and\\nrecoiled.\\n\\nThe coffin was empty!\\n\\nFor several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by\\nQuincey Morris:--\\n\\n“Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn’t ask\\nsuch a thing ordinarily--I wouldn’t so dishonour you as to imply a\\ndoubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.\\nIs this your doing?”\\n\\n“I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor\\ntouched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward and\\nI came here--with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, which\\nwas then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, and\\nsaw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here in\\nday-time, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing,\\nand we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came\\nhere before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited here\\nall the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable\\nthat it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic,\\nwhich the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Last\\nnight there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I took away my\\ngarlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. But\\nbear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with me\\noutside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be.\\nSo”--here he shut the dark slide of his lantern--“now to the outside.”\\nHe opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the\\ndoor behind him.\\n\\nOh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of\\nthat vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing\\ngleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and\\npassing--like the gladness and sorrow of a man’s life; how sweet it was\\nto breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay; how\\nhumanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to\\nhear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city. Each\\nin his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and was, I\\ncould see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the\\nmystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to\\nthrow aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing’s conclusions. Quincey\\nMorris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and\\naccepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has to\\nstake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of\\ntobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a\\ndefinite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like\\nthin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white\\nnapkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like\\ndough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the\\nmass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thin\\nstrips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its\\nsetting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close,\\nasked him what it was that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near\\nalso, as they too were curious. He answered:--\\n\\n“I am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter.”\\n\\n“And is that stuff you have put there going to do it?” asked Quincey.\\n“Great Scott! Is this a game?”\\n\\n“It is.”\\n\\n“What is that which you are using?” This time the question was by\\nArthur. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered:--\\n\\n“The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an Indulgence.” It was an\\nanswer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually\\nthat in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor’s, a\\npurpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was\\nimpossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the places\\nassigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any\\none approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself\\nbeen apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet I,\\nwho had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink\\nwithin me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, or\\nyew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did tree\\nor grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so\\nmysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a\\nwoeful presage through the night.\\n\\nThere was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from the\\nProfessor a keen “S-s-s-s!” He pointed; and far down the avenue of yews\\nwe saw a white figure advance--a dim white figure, which held something\\ndark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of\\nmoonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling\\nprominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave.\\nWe could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a\\nfair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a\\nchild gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. We\\nwere starting forward, but the Professor’s warning hand, seen by us as\\nhe stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the\\nwhite figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to see\\nclearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice,\\nand I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features of\\nLucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was\\nturned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous\\nwantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we\\nall advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the\\ntomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the\\nconcentrated light that fell on Lucy’s face we could see that the lips\\nwere crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her\\nchin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.\\n\\nWe shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even\\nVan Helsing’s iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I had\\nnot seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.\\n\\nWhen Lucy--I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her\\nshape--saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives\\nwhen taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy’s eyes in form\\nand colour; but Lucy’s eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of\\nthe pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my love\\npassed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have\\ndone it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy\\nlight, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God,\\nhow it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung to\\nthe ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had\\nclutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls\\nover a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There\\nwas a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; when\\nshe advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell\\nback and hid his face in his hands.\\n\\nShe still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace,\\nsaid:--\\n\\n“Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are\\nhungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my husband, come!”\\n\\nThere was something diabolically sweet in her tones--something of the\\ntingling of glass when struck--which rang through the brains even of us\\nwho heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed under\\na spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms. She\\nwas leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between\\nthem his little golden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and, with a\\nsuddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter\\nthe tomb.\\n\\nWhen within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if\\narrested by some irresistible force. Then she turned, and her face was\\nshown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no\\nquiver from Van Helsing’s iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled\\nmalice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by\\nmortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw\\nout sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of\\nthe flesh were the coils of Medusa’s snakes, and the lovely,\\nblood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of\\nthe Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant death--if looks could\\nkill--we saw it at that moment.\\n\\nAnd so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained\\nbetween the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of\\nentry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:--\\n\\n“Answer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?”\\n\\nArthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he\\nanswered:--\\n\\n“Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like\\nthis ever any more;” and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I\\nsimultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear the\\nclick of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close\\nto the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred\\nemblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified\\namazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal\\nbody as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice\\nwhere scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of\\nrelief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty\\nto the edges of the door.\\n\\nWhen this was done, he lifted the child and said:\\n\\n“Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow. There is a\\nfuneral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. The\\nfriends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock\\nthe gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do; but not like this of\\nto-night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to-morrow\\nnight he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police will find\\nhim, as on the other night; and then to home.” Coming close to Arthur,\\nhe said:--\\n\\n“My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you look\\nback, you will see how it was necessary. You are now in the bitter\\nwaters, my child. By this time to-morrow you will, please God, have\\npassed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn\\novermuch. Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me.”\\n\\nArthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other\\non the way. We had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we all\\nslept with more or less reality of sleep.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_29 September, night._--A little before twelve o’clock we three--Arthur,\\nQuincey Morris, and myself--called for the Professor. It was odd to\\nnotice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. Of\\ncourse, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of\\nus wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by half-past one, and\\nstrolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the\\ngravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief\\nthat every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to\\nourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a\\nlong leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of\\nfair weight.\\n\\nWhen we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up\\nthe road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the\\nProfessor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it\\nbehind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also\\ntwo wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their own\\nends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work\\nby. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy’s coffin we all looked--Arthur\\ntrembling like an aspen--and saw that the body lay there in all its\\ndeath-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but\\nloathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy’s shape without her\\nsoul. I could see even Arthur’s face grow hard as he looked. Presently\\nhe said to Van Helsing:--\\n\\n“Is this really Lucy’s body, or only a demon in her shape?”\\n\\n“It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see her\\nas she was, and is.”\\n\\nShe seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth,\\nthe bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which it made one shudder to\\nsee--the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a\\ndevilish mockery of Lucy’s sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usual\\nmethodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and\\nplacing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and some\\nplumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in\\na corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue\\nflame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a\\nround wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about\\nthree feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and\\nwas sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such\\nas in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. To\\nme, a doctor’s preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and\\nbracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was\\nto cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept their\\ncourage, and remained silent and quiet.\\n\\nWhen all was ready, Van Helsing said:--\\n\\n“Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore and\\nexperience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers\\nof the Un-Dead. When they become such, there comes with the change the\\ncurse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age\\nadding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all that\\ndie from the preying of the Un-Dead becomes themselves Un-Dead, and prey\\non their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the\\nripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if you had met\\nthat kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last night\\nwhen you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died,\\nhave become _nosferatu_, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would\\nall time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with horror.\\nThe career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun. Those\\nchildren whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if\\nshe live on, Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by her\\npower over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with that\\nso wicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny\\nwounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays\\nunknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when\\nthis now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor\\nlady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by\\nnight and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she\\nshall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it will\\nbe a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free.\\nTo this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a better\\nright? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the\\nnight when sleep is not: ‘It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it\\nwas the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would\\nherself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?’ Tell me if there be\\nsuch a one amongst us?”\\n\\nWe all looked at Arthur. He saw, too, what we all did, the infinite\\nkindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore\\nLucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped forward and\\nsaid bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as\\nsnow:--\\n\\n“My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell me\\nwhat I am to do, and I shall not falter!” Van Helsing laid a hand on his\\nshoulder, and said:--\\n\\n“Brave lad! A moment’s courage, and it is done. This stake must be\\ndriven through her. It will be a fearful ordeal--be not deceived in\\nthat--but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more\\nthan your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though\\nyou tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have begun. Only\\nthink that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for\\nyou all the time.”\\n\\n“Go on,” said Arthur hoarsely. “Tell me what I am to do.”\\n\\n“Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the\\nheart, and the hammer in your right. Then when we begin our prayer for\\nthe dead--I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall\\nfollow--strike in God’s name, that so all may be well with the dead that\\nwe love and that the Un-Dead pass away.”\\n\\nArthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on\\naction his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing opened\\nhis missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we\\ncould. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could\\nsee its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might.\\n\\nThe Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screech\\ncame from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted\\nin wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the\\nlips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthur\\nnever faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm\\nrose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst\\nthe blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. His\\nface was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it\\ngave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little\\nvault.\\n\\nAnd then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the\\nteeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. The\\nterrible task was over.\\n\\nThe hammer fell from Arthur’s hand. He reeled and would have fallen had\\nwe not caught him. The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead,\\nand his breath came in broken gasps. It had indeed been an awful strain\\non him; and had he not been forced to his task by more than human\\nconsiderations he could never have gone through with it. For a few\\nminutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the\\ncoffin. When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from one\\nto the other of us. We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he had\\nbeen seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a glad,\\nstrange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of\\nhorror that lay upon it.\\n\\nThere, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded\\nand grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a\\nprivilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in\\nher life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. True that\\nthere were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and\\npain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth\\nto what we knew. One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like\\nsunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and\\nsymbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.\\n\\nVan Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur’s shoulder, and said to\\nhim:--\\n\\n“And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?”\\n\\nThe reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man’s hand\\nin his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:--\\n\\n“Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again,\\nand me peace.” He put his hands on the Professor’s shoulder, and laying\\nhis head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood\\nunmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him:--\\n\\n“And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will, as\\nshe would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a grinning\\ndevil now--not any more a foul Thing for all eternity. No longer she is\\nthe devil’s Un-Dead. She is God’s true dead, whose soul is with Him!”\\n\\nArthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the\\ntomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point\\nof it in the body. Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with\\ngarlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid,\\nand gathering up our belongings, came away. When the Professor locked\\nthe door he gave the key to Arthur.\\n\\nOutside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it\\nseemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch. There was\\ngladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves\\non one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy.\\n\\nBefore we moved away Van Helsing said:--\\n\\n“Now, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing\\nto ourselves. But there remains a greater task: to find out the author\\nof all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. I have clues which we can\\nfollow; but it is a long task, and a difficult, and there is danger in\\nit, and pain. Shall you not all help me? We have learned to believe, all\\nof us--is it not so? And since so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And do\\nwe not promise to go on to the bitter end?”\\n\\nEach in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. Then said the\\nProfessor as we moved off:--\\n\\n“Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of\\nthe clock with friend John. I shall entreat two others, two that you\\nknow not as yet; and I shall be ready to all our work show and our plans\\nunfold. Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to consult\\nabout, and you can help me. To-night I leave for Amsterdam, but shall\\nreturn to-morrow night. And then begins our great quest. But first I\\nshall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to dread.\\nThen our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is a\\nterrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare we\\nmust not draw back.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\nDR. SEWARD’S DIARY--_continued_\\n\\n\\nWhen we arrived at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegram\\nwaiting for him:--\\n\\n     “Am coming up by train. Jonathan at Whitby. Important news.--MINA\\n     HARKER.”\\n\\nThe Professor was delighted. “Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina,” he said,\\n“pearl among women! She arrive, but I cannot stay. She must go to your\\nhouse, friend John. You must meet her at the station. Telegraph her _en\\nroute_, so that she may be prepared.”\\n\\nWhen the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told me of\\na diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a typewritten\\ncopy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker’s diary at Whitby. “Take these,” he\\nsaid, “and study them well. When I have returned you will be master of\\nall the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keep\\nthem safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all your\\nfaith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day. What\\nis here told,” he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of\\npapers as he spoke, “may be the beginning of the end to you and me and\\nmany another; or it may sound the knell of the Un-Dead who walk the\\nearth. Read all, I pray you, with the open mind; and if you can add in\\nany way to the story here told do so, for it is all-important. You have\\nkept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so? Yes! Then we\\nshall go through all these together when we meet.” He then made ready\\nfor his departure, and shortly after drove off to Liverpool Street. I\\ntook my way to Paddington, where I arrived about fifteen minutes before\\nthe train came in.\\n\\nThe crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrival\\nplatforms; and I was beginning to feel uneasy, lest I might miss my\\nguest, when a sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to me, and,\\nafter a quick glance, said: “Dr. Seward, is it not?”\\n\\n“And you are Mrs. Harker!” I answered at once; whereupon she held out\\nher hand.\\n\\n“I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy; but----” She stopped\\nsuddenly, and a quick blush overspread her face.\\n\\nThe blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for it\\nwas a tacit answer to her own. I got her luggage, which included a\\ntypewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I had\\nsent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting-room and bedroom\\nprepared at once for Mrs. Harker.\\n\\nIn due time we arrived. She knew, of course, that the place was a\\nlunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a shudder\\nwhen we entered.\\n\\nShe told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, as\\nshe had much to say. So here I am finishing my entry in my phonograph\\ndiary whilst I await her. As yet I have not had the chance of looking at\\nthe papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they lie open before\\nme. I must get her interested in something, so that I may have an\\nopportunity of reading them. She does not know how precious time is, or\\nwhat a task we have in hand. I must be careful not to frighten her. Here\\nshe is!\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker’s Journal._\\n\\n_29 September._--After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward’s\\nstudy. At the door I paused a moment, for I thought I heard him talking\\nwith some one. As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked at\\nthe door, and on his calling out, “Come in,” I entered.\\n\\nTo my intense surprise, there was no one with him. He was quite alone,\\nand on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from the\\ndescription to be a phonograph. I had never seen one, and was much\\ninterested.\\n\\n“I hope I did not keep you waiting,” I said; “but I stayed at the door\\nas I heard you talking, and thought there was some one with you.”\\n\\n“Oh,” he replied with a smile, “I was only entering my diary.”\\n\\n“Your diary?” I asked him in surprise.\\n\\n“Yes,” he answered. “I keep it in this.” As he spoke he laid his hand on\\nthe phonograph. I felt quite excited over it, and blurted out:--\\n\\n“Why, this beats even shorthand! May I hear it say something?”\\n\\n“Certainly,” he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in train\\nfor speaking. Then he paused, and a troubled look overspread his face.\\n\\n“The fact is,” he began awkwardly, “I only keep my diary in it; and as\\nit is entirely--almost entirely--about my cases, it may be awkward--that\\nis, I mean----” He stopped, and I tried to help him out of his\\nembarrassment:--\\n\\n“You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear how she died;\\nfor all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful. She was very, very\\ndear to me.”\\n\\nTo my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face:--\\n\\n“Tell you of her death? Not for the wide world!”\\n\\n“Why not?” I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me.\\nAgain he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse.\\nAt length he stammered out:--\\n\\n“You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the\\ndiary.” Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he said\\nwith unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the naïveté\\nof a child: “That’s quite true, upon my honour. Honest Indian!” I could\\nnot but smile, at which he grimaced. “I gave myself away that time!” he\\nsaid. “But do you know that, although I have kept the diary for months\\npast, it never once struck me how I was going to find any particular\\npart of it in case I wanted to look it up?” By this time my mind was\\nmade up that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might have\\nsomething to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible Being, and\\nI said boldly:--\\n\\n“Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you on my\\ntypewriter.” He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said:--\\n\\n“No! no! no! For all the world, I wouldn’t let you know that terrible\\nstory!”\\n\\nThen it was terrible; my intuition was right! For a moment I thought,\\nand as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something or\\nsome opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of typewriting on\\nthe table. His eyes caught the look in mine, and, without his thinking,\\nfollowed their direction. As they saw the parcel he realised my meaning.\\n\\n“You do not know me,” I said. “When you have read those papers--my own\\ndiary and my husband’s also, which I have typed--you will know me\\nbetter. I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in\\nthis cause; but, of course, you do not know me--yet; and I must not\\nexpect you to trust me so far.”\\n\\nHe is certainly a man of noble nature; poor dear Lucy was right about\\nhim. He stood up and opened a large drawer, in which were arranged in\\norder a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and\\nsaid:--\\n\\n“You are quite right. I did not trust you because I did not know you.\\nBut I know you now; and let me say that I should have known you long\\nago. I know that Lucy told you of me; she told me of you too. May I make\\nthe only atonement in my power? Take the cylinders and hear them--the\\nfirst half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not horrify\\nyou; then you will know me better. Dinner will by then be ready. In the\\nmeantime I shall read over some of these documents, and shall be better\\nable to understand certain things.” He carried the phonograph himself up\\nto my sitting-room and adjusted it for me. Now I shall learn something\\npleasant, I am sure; for it will tell me the other side of a true love\\nepisode of which I know one side already....\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n_29 September._--I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of Jonathan\\nHarker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on without\\nthinking. Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announce\\ndinner, so I said: “She is possibly tired; let dinner wait an hour,” and\\nI went on with my work. I had just finished Mrs. Harker’s diary, when\\nshe came in. She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes were\\nflushed with crying. This somehow moved me much. Of late I have had\\ncause for tears, God knows! but the relief of them was denied me; and\\nnow the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears, went\\nstraight to my heart. So I said as gently as I could:--\\n\\n“I greatly fear I have distressed you.”\\n\\n“Oh, no, not distressed me,” she replied, “but I have been more touched\\nthan I can say by your grief. That is a wonderful machine, but it is\\ncruelly true. It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart.\\nIt was like a soul crying out to Almighty God. No one must hear them\\nspoken ever again! See, I have tried to be useful. I have copied out the\\nwords on my typewriter, and none other need now hear your heart beat, as\\nI did.”\\n\\n“No one need ever know, shall ever know,” I said in a low voice. She\\nlaid her hand on mine and said very gravely:--\\n\\n“Ah, but they must!”\\n\\n“Must! But why?” I asked.\\n\\n“Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part of poor dear Lucy’s\\ndeath and all that led to it; because in the struggle which we have\\nbefore us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all\\nthe knowledge and all the help which we can get. I think that the\\ncylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know;\\nbut I can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark\\nmystery. You will let me help, will you not? I know all up to a certain\\npoint; and I see already, though your diary only took me to 7 September,\\nhow poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being wrought\\nout. Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor Van\\nHelsing saw us. He is gone to Whitby to get more information, and he\\nwill be here to-morrow to help us. We need have no secrets amongst us;\\nworking together and with absolute trust, we can surely be stronger than\\nif some of us were in the dark.” She looked at me so appealingly, and at\\nthe same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing,\\nthat I gave in at once to her wishes. “You shall,” I said, “do as you\\nlike in the matter. God forgive me if I do wrong! There are terrible\\nthings yet to learn of; but if you have so far travelled on the road to\\npoor Lucy’s death, you will not be content, I know, to remain in the\\ndark. Nay, the end--the very end--may give you a gleam of peace. Come,\\nthere is dinner. We must keep one another strong for what is before us;\\nwe have a cruel and dreadful task. When you have eaten you shall learn\\nthe rest, and I shall answer any questions you ask--if there be anything\\nwhich you do not understand, though it was apparent to us who were\\npresent.”\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker’s Journal._\\n\\n_29 September._--After dinner I came with Dr. Seward to his study. He\\nbrought back the phonograph from my room, and I took my typewriter. He\\nplaced me in a comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that I\\ncould touch it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in case\\nI should want to pause. Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, with his\\nback to me, so that I might be as free as possible, and began to read. I\\nput the forked metal to my ears and listened.\\n\\nWhen the terrible story of Lucy’s death, and--and all that followed, was\\ndone, I lay back in my chair powerless. Fortunately I am not of a\\nfainting disposition. When Dr. Seward saw me he jumped up with a\\nhorrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case-bottle from a\\ncupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few minutes somewhat restored\\nme. My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through all\\nthe multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear Lucy\\nwas at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it without\\nmaking a scene. It is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if I\\nhad not known Jonathan’s experience in Transylvania I could not have\\nbelieved. As it was, I didn’t know what to believe, and so got out of my\\ndifficulty by attending to something else. I took the cover off my\\ntypewriter, and said to Dr. Seward:--\\n\\n“Let me write this all out now. We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsing\\nwhen he comes. I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here when\\nhe arrives in London from Whitby. In this matter dates are everything,\\nand I think that if we get all our material ready, and have every item\\nput in chronological order, we shall have done much. You tell me that\\nLord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too. Let us be able to tell him\\nwhen they come.” He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and I\\nbegan to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder. I used\\nmanifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done with\\nall the rest. It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward went about\\nhis work of going his round of the patients; when he had finished he\\ncame back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonely\\nwhilst I worked. How good and thoughtful he is; the world seems full of\\ngood men--even if there _are_ monsters in it. Before I left him I\\nremembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the Professor’s\\nperturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at\\nExeter; so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed the\\nfiles of “The Westminster Gazette” and “The Pall Mall Gazette,” and took\\nthem to my room. I remember how much “The Dailygraph” and “The Whitby\\nGazette,” of which I had made cuttings, helped us to understand the\\nterrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed, so I shall look\\nthrough the evening papers since then, and perhaps I shall get some new\\nlight. I am not sleepy, and the work will help to keep me quiet.\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n_30 September._--Mr. Harker arrived at nine o’clock. He had got his\\nwife’s wire just before starting. He is uncommonly clever, if one can\\njudge from his face, and full of energy. If this journal be true--and\\njudging by one’s own wonderful experiences, it must be--he is also a man\\nof great nerve. That going down to the vault a second time was a\\nremarkable piece of daring. After reading his account of it I was\\nprepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet,\\nbusiness-like gentleman who came here to-day.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later._--After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room,\\nand as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter. They\\nare hard at it. Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together in\\nchronological order every scrap of evidence they have. Harker has got\\nthe letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the\\ncarriers in London who took charge of them. He is now reading his wife’s\\ntypescript of my diary. I wonder what they make out of it. Here it\\nis....\\n\\n     Strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be\\n     the Count’s hiding-place! Goodness knows that we had enough clues\\n     from the conduct of the patient Renfield! The bundle of letters\\n     relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript. Oh,\\n     if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy!\\n     Stop; that way madness lies! Harker has gone back, and is again\\n     collating his material. He says that by dinner-time they will be\\n     able to show a whole connected narrative. He thinks that in the\\n     meantime I should see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a sort of\\n     index to the coming and going of the Count. I hardly see this yet,\\n     but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall. What a good thing\\n     that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type! We never could have\\n     found the dates otherwise....\\n\\n     I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands\\n     folded, smiling benignly. At the moment he seemed as sane as any\\n     one I ever saw. I sat down and talked with him on a lot of\\n     subjects, all of which he treated naturally. He then, of his own\\n     accord, spoke of going home, a subject he has never mentioned to my\\n     knowledge during his sojourn here. In fact, he spoke quite\\n     confidently of getting his discharge at once. I believe that, had I\\n     not had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of\\n     his outbursts, I should have been prepared to sign for him after a\\n     brief time of observation. As it is, I am darkly suspicious. All\\n     those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the\\n     Count. What then does this absolute content mean? Can it be that\\n     his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire’s ultimate triumph?\\n     Stay; he is himself zoöphagous, and in his wild ravings outside the\\n     chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of “master.” This\\n     all seems confirmation of our idea. However, after a while I came\\n     away; my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it\\n     safe to probe him too deep with questions. He might begin to think,\\n     and then--! So I came away. I mistrust these quiet moods of his; so\\n     I have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and to\\n     have a strait-waistcoat ready in case of need.\\n\\n\\n_Jonathan Harker’s Journal._\\n\\n_29 September, in train to London._--When I received Mr. Billington’s\\ncourteous message that he would give me any information in his power I\\nthought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such\\ninquiries as I wanted. It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo\\nof the Count’s to its place in London. Later, we may be able to deal\\nwith it. Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and\\nbrought me to his father’s house, where they had decided that I must\\nstay the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality:\\ngive a guest everything, and leave him free to do as he likes. They all\\nknew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington had\\nready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes.\\nIt gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had\\nseen on the Count’s table before I knew of his diabolical plans.\\nEverything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and\\nwith precision. He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which\\nmight be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried\\nout. To use an Americanism, he had “taken no chances,” and the absolute\\naccuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was simply the\\nlogical result of his care. I saw the invoice, and took note of it:\\n“Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes.”\\nAlso the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both of\\nthese I got copies. This was all the information Mr. Billington could\\ngive me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs\\nofficers and the harbour-master. They had all something to say of the\\nstrange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in local\\ntradition; but no one could add to the simple description “Fifty cases\\nof common earth.” I then saw the station-master, who kindly put me in\\ncommunication with the men who had actually received the boxes. Their\\ntally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that\\nthe boxes were “main and mortal heavy,” and that shifting them was dry\\nwork. One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn’t any\\ngentleman “such-like as yourself, squire,” to show some sort of\\nappreciation of their efforts in a liquid form; another put in a rider\\nthat the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had\\nelapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took care\\nbefore leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source of\\nreproach.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_30 September._--The station-master was good enough to give me a line to\\nhis old companion the station-master at King’s Cross, so that when I\\narrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival of\\nthe boxes. He, too, put me at once in communication with the proper\\nofficials, and I saw that their tally was correct with the original\\ninvoice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here\\nlimited; a noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I was\\ncompelled to deal with the result in an _ex post facto_ manner.\\n\\nFrom thence I went on to Carter Paterson’s central office, where I met\\nwith the utmost courtesy. They looked up the transaction in their\\nday-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to their King’s Cross\\noffice for more details. By good fortune, the men who did the teaming\\nwere waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sending\\nalso by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the\\ndelivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I found the tally agreeing\\nexactly; the carriers’ men were able to supplement the paucity of the\\nwritten words with a few details. These were, I shortly found, connected\\nalmost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the consequent\\nthirst engendered in the operators. On my affording an opportunity,\\nthrough the medium of the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a\\nlater period, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked:--\\n\\n“That ’ere ’ouse, guv’nor, is the rummiest I ever was in. Blyme! but it\\nain’t been touched sence a hundred years. There was dust that thick in\\nthe place that you might have slep’ on it without ’urtin’ of yer bones;\\nan’ the place was that neglected that yer might ’ave smelled ole\\nJerusalem in it. But the ole chapel--that took the cike, that did! Me\\nand my mate, we thort we wouldn’t never git out quick enough. Lor’, I\\nwouldn’t take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark.”\\n\\nHaving been in the house, I could well believe him; but if he knew what\\nI know, he would, I think, have raised his terms.\\n\\nOf one thing I am now satisfied: that _all_ the boxes which arrived at\\nWhitby from Varna in the _Demeter_ were safely deposited in the old\\nchapel at Carfax. There should be fifty of them there, unless any have\\nsince been removed--as from Dr. Seward’s diary I fear.\\n\\nI shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from Carfax when\\nRenfield attacked them. By following up this clue we may learn a good\\ndeal.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later._--Mina and I have worked all day, and we have put all the papers\\ninto order.\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker’s Journal_\\n\\n_30 September._--I am so glad that I hardly know how to contain myself.\\nIt is, I suppose, the reaction from the haunting fear which I have had:\\nthat this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act\\ndetrimentally on Jonathan. I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave a\\nface as I could, but I was sick with apprehension. The effort has,\\nhowever, done him good. He was never so resolute, never so strong, never\\nso full of volcanic energy, as at present. It is just as that dear, good\\nProfessor Van Helsing said: he is true grit, and he improves under\\nstrain that would kill a weaker nature. He came back full of life and\\nhope and determination; we have got everything in order for to-night. I\\nfeel myself quite wild with excitement. I suppose one ought to pity any\\nthing so hunted as is the Count. That is just it: this Thing is not\\nhuman--not even beast. To read Dr. Seward’s account of poor Lucy’s\\ndeath, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of pity in\\none’s heart.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later._--Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we\\nexpected. Dr. Seward was out on business, and had taken Jonathan with\\nhim, so I had to see them. It was to me a painful meeting, for it\\nbrought back all poor dear Lucy’s hopes of only a few months ago. Of\\ncourse they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. Van\\nHelsing, too, has been quite “blowing my trumpet,” as Mr. Morris\\nexpressed it. Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know all\\nabout the proposals they made to Lucy. They did not quite know what to\\nsay or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so they\\nhad to keep on neutral subjects. However, I thought the matter over, and\\ncame to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to post\\nthem in affairs right up to date. I knew from Dr. Seward’s diary that\\nthey had been at Lucy’s death--her real death--and that I need not fear\\nto betray any secret before the time. So I told them, as well as I\\ncould, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband\\nand I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order.\\nI gave them each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming got\\nhis and turned it over--it does make a pretty good pile--he said:--\\n\\n“Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?”\\n\\nI nodded, and he went on:--\\n\\n“I don’t quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and\\nkind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that all\\nI can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I have\\nhad one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble\\nto the last hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved my poor Lucy--”\\nHere he turned away and covered his face with his hands. I could hear\\nthe tears in his voice. Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laid\\na hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the\\nroom. I suppose there is something in woman’s nature that makes a man\\nfree to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or\\nemotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood; for when\\nLord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and\\ngave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and took his hand. I\\nhope he didn’t think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of it\\nafterwards he never will have such a thought. There I wrong him; I\\n_know_ he never will--he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I\\ncould see that his heart was breaking:--\\n\\n“I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were to\\nher. She and I were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not let\\nme be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what sorrows you have\\nhad, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity can\\nhelp in your affliction, won’t you let me be of some little service--for\\nLucy’s sake?”\\n\\nIn an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It seemed\\nto me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a\\nvent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat\\nhis palms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up and then sat\\ndown again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I felt an infinite\\npity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob he laid his\\nhead on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst he shook with\\nemotion.\\n\\nWe women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above\\nsmaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; I felt this big\\nsorrowing man’s head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby\\nthat some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he\\nwere my own child. I never thought at the time how strange it all was.\\n\\nAfter a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an\\napology, though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that for\\ndays and nights past--weary days and sleepless nights--he had been\\nunable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of\\nsorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with\\nwhom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was\\nsurrounded, he could speak freely. “I know now how I suffered,” he said,\\nas he dried his eyes, “but I do not know even yet--and none other can\\never know--how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day. I shall\\nknow better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful\\nnow, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. You will let me be\\nlike a brother, will you not, for all our lives--for dear Lucy’s sake?”\\n\\n“For dear Lucy’s sake,” I said as we clasped hands. “Ay, and for your\\nown sake,” he added, “for if a man’s esteem and gratitude are ever worth\\nthe winning, you have won mine to-day. If ever the future should bring\\nto you a time when you need a man’s help, believe me, you will not call\\nin vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the\\nsunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that you\\nwill let me know.” He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that\\nI felt it would comfort him, so I said:--\\n\\n“I promise.”\\n\\nAs I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window.\\nHe turned as he heard my footsteps. “How is Art?” he said. Then noticing\\nmy red eyes, he went on: “Ah, I see you have been comforting him. Poor\\nold fellow! he needs it. No one but a woman can help a man when he is in\\ntrouble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort him.”\\n\\nHe bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. I saw the\\nmanuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would realise\\nhow much I knew; so I said to him:--\\n\\n“I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let me\\nbe your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? You\\nwill know, later on, why I speak.” He saw that I was in earnest, and\\nstooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It seemed\\nbut poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I\\nbent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a\\nmomentary choking in his throat; he said quite calmly:--\\n\\n“Little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long\\nas ever you live!” Then he went into the study to his friend.\\n\\n“Little girl!”--the very words he had used to Lucy, and oh, but he\\nproved himself a friend!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\nDR. SEWARD’S DIARY\\n\\n\\n_30 September._--I got home at five o’clock, and found that Godalming\\nand Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript\\nof the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wife\\nhad made and arranged. Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the\\ncarriers’ men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me. Mrs. Harker gave\\nus a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time since I\\nhave lived in it, this old house seemed like _home_. When we had\\nfinished, Mrs. Harker said:--\\n\\n“Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr.\\nRenfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your diary\\ninterests me so much!” She looked so appealing and so pretty that I\\ncould not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should; so\\nI took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that a\\nlady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: “Why?”\\n\\n“She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,” I\\nanswered. “Oh, very well,” he said; “let her come in, by all means; but\\njust wait a minute till I tidy up the place.” His method of tidying was\\npeculiar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes\\nbefore I could stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, or was\\njealous of, some interference. When he had got through his disgusting\\ntask, he said cheerfully: “Let the lady come in,” and sat down on the\\nedge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that\\nhe could see her as she entered. For a moment I thought that he might\\nhave some homicidal intent; I remembered how quiet he had been just\\nbefore he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where I\\ncould seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her. She\\ncame into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command\\nthe respect of any lunatic--for easiness is one of the qualities mad\\npeople most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and\\nheld out her hand.\\n\\n“Good-evening, Mr. Renfield,” said she. “You see, I know you, for Dr.\\nSeward has told me of you.” He made no immediate reply, but eyed her all\\nover intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave way to one\\nof wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, he\\nsaid:--\\n\\n“You’re not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can’t be,\\nyou know, for she’s dead.” Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied:--\\n\\n“Oh no! I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I ever\\nsaw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker.”\\n\\n“Then what are you doing here?”\\n\\n“My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward.”\\n\\n“Then don’t stay.”\\n\\n“But why not?” I thought that this style of conversation might not be\\npleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in:--\\n\\n“How did you know I wanted to marry any one?” His reply was simply\\ncontemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs.\\nHarker to me, instantly turning them back again:--\\n\\n“What an asinine question!”\\n\\n“I don’t see that at all, Mr. Renfield,” said Mrs. Harker, at once\\nchampioning me. He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as\\nhe had shown contempt to me:--\\n\\n“You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so\\nloved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of\\ninterest in our little community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by his\\nhousehold and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of\\nthem hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and\\neffects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I\\ncannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates\\nlean towards the errors of _non causa_ and _ignoratio elenchi_.” I\\npositively opened my eyes at this new development. Here was my own pet\\nlunatic--the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met\\nwith--talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished\\ngentleman. I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker’s presence which had touched\\nsome chord in his memory. If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any\\nway due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or\\npower.\\n\\nWe continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seemingly\\nquite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she\\nbegan, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was again astonished, for\\nhe addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the\\ncompletest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentioned\\ncertain things.\\n\\n“Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed,\\nit was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my being\\nput under control. I used to fancy that life was a positive and\\nperpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no\\nmatter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong\\nlife. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to\\ntake human life. The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion I\\ntried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by\\nthe assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his\\nblood--relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, ‘For the blood is\\nthe life.’ Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has\\nvulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn’t that true,\\ndoctor?” I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to\\neither think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up\\nhis spiders and flies not five minutes before. Looking at my watch, I\\nsaw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs.\\nHarker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after saying\\npleasantly to Mr. Renfield: “Good-bye, and I hope I may see you often,\\nunder auspices pleasanter to yourself,” to which, to my astonishment, he\\nreplied:--\\n\\n“Good-bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again.\\nMay He bless and keep you!”\\n\\nWhen I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind\\nme. Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first took\\nill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for\\nmany a long day.\\n\\nVan Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a\\nboy. He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying:--\\n\\n“Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have been busy, for I come\\nhere to stay if need be. All affairs are settled with me, and I have\\nmuch to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine husband? And\\nArthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too? Good!”\\n\\nAs I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my own\\ndiary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker’s suggestion; at\\nwhich the Professor interrupted me:--\\n\\n“Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man’s brain--a brain that a man\\nshould have were he much gifted--and a woman’s heart. The good God\\nfashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so good\\ncombination. Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help\\nto us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terrible\\naffair. It is not good that she run a risk so great. We men are\\ndetermined--nay, are we not pledged?--to destroy this monster; but it is\\nno part for a woman. Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her\\nin so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer--both in\\nwaking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. And, besides,\\nshe is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things to\\nthink of some time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then she\\nmust consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, and\\nwe go alone.” I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we\\nhad found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought was\\nthe very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed\\nto come on him. “Oh that we had known it before!” he said, “for then we\\nmight have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, ‘the milk\\nthat is spilt cries not out afterwards,’ as you say. We shall not think\\nof that, but go on our way to the end.” Then he fell into a silence that\\nlasted till we entered my own gateway. Before we went to prepare for\\ndinner he said to Mrs. Harker:--\\n\\n“I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband have\\nput up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment.”\\n\\n“Not up to this moment, Professor,” she said impulsively, “but up to\\nthis morning.”\\n\\n“But why not up to now? We have seen hitherto how good light all the\\nlittle things have made. We have told our secrets, and yet no one who\\nhas told is the worse for it.”\\n\\nMrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, she\\nsaid:--\\n\\n“Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in. It\\nis my record of to-day. I too have seen the need of putting down at\\npresent everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except\\nwhat is personal. Must it go in?” The Professor read it over gravely,\\nand handed it back, saying:--\\n\\n“It need not go in if you do not wish it; but I pray that it may. It can\\nbut make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, more\\nhonour you--as well as more esteem and love.” She took it back with\\nanother blush and a bright smile.\\n\\nAnd so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete\\nand in order. The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner,\\nand before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o’clock. The rest of us\\nhave already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall all\\nbe informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this\\nterrible and mysterious enemy.\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker’s Journal._\\n\\n_30 September._--When we met in Dr. Seward’s study two hours after\\ndinner, which had been at six o’clock, we unconsciously formed a sort of\\nboard or committee. Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table, to\\nwhich Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room. He made me sit\\nnext to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary; Jonathan sat\\nnext to me. Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr.\\nMorris--Lord Godalming being next the Professor, and Dr. Seward in the\\ncentre. The Professor said:--\\n\\n“I may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts\\nthat are in these papers.” We all expressed assent, and he went on:--\\n\\n“Then it were, I think good that I tell you something of the kind of\\nenemy with which we have to deal. I shall then make known to you\\nsomething of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me.\\nSo we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measure\\naccording.\\n\\n“There are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that they\\nexist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the\\nteachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane\\npeoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not that\\nthrough long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could not\\nhave believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. ‘See! see!\\nI prove; I prove.’ Alas! Had I known at the first what now I know--nay,\\nhad I even guess at him--one so precious life had been spared to many of\\nus who did love her. But that is gone; and we must so work, that other\\npoor souls perish not, whilst we can save. The _nosferatu_ do not die\\nlike the bee when he sting once. He is only stronger; and being\\nstronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which is\\namongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is of\\ncunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he have\\nstill the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, the\\ndivination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to are\\nfor him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil in\\ncallous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations, appear\\nat will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; he\\ncan, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, the\\nthunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and\\nthe bat--the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and become\\nsmall; and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are we to\\nbegin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and having\\nfound it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a terrible\\ntask that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave\\nshudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win; and then\\nwhere end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail here, is not\\nmere life or death. It is that we become as him; that we henceforward\\nbecome foul things of the night like him--without heart or conscience,\\npreying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. To us for\\never are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again?\\nWe go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of God’s\\nsunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man. But we are face\\nto face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? For me, I say, no;\\nbut then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his\\nsong of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind. You others are\\nyoung. Some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in store. What\\nsay you?”\\n\\nWhilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand. I feared, oh so\\nmuch, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I\\nsaw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its touch--so\\nstrong, so self-reliant, so resolute. A brave man’s hand can speak for\\nitself; it does not even need a woman’s love to hear its music.\\n\\nWhen the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and I\\nin his; there was no need for speaking between us.\\n\\n“I answer for Mina and myself,” he said.\\n\\n“Count me in, Professor,” said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as usual.\\n\\n“I am with you,” said Lord Godalming, “for Lucy’s sake, if for no other\\nreason.”\\n\\nDr. Seward simply nodded. The Professor stood up and, after laying his\\ngolden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. I took\\nhis right hand, and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan held my right with\\nhis left and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So as we all took hands our\\nsolemn compact was made. I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even\\noccur to me to draw back. We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing\\nwent on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work\\nhad begun. It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way,\\nas any other transaction of life:--\\n\\n“Well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not\\nwithout strength. We have on our side power of combination--a power\\ndenied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free to\\nact and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally.\\nIn fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are\\nfree to use them. We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end to\\nachieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.\\n\\n“Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are\\nrestrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider the\\nlimitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.\\n\\n“All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do not\\nat the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death--nay\\nof more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied; in the\\nfirst place because we have to be--no other means is at our control--and\\nsecondly, because, after all, these things--tradition and\\nsuperstition--are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for\\nothers--though not, alas! for us--on them? A year ago which of us would\\nhave received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific,\\nsceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a belief\\nthat we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that the\\nvampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the\\nmoment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere\\nthat men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germany\\nall over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, so\\nfar from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at\\nthis day. He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the\\ndevil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then, we\\nhave all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of the\\nbeliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy\\nexperience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the\\ntime; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the\\nliving. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow\\nyounger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though\\nthey refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. But he\\ncannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others. Even friend\\nJonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never!\\nHe throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as again\\nJonathan observe. He has the strength of many of his hand--witness again\\nJonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him\\nfrom the diligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather\\nfrom the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as\\nbat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John\\nsaw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at\\nthe window of Miss Lucy. He can come in mist which he create--that noble\\nship’s captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance\\nhe can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. He\\ncome on moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again Jonathan saw those\\nsisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small--we ourselves saw\\nMiss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the\\ntomb door. He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything or\\ninto anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with\\nfire--solder you call it. He can see in the dark--no small power this,\\nin a world which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear me\\nthrough. He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay; he is even\\nmore prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell.\\nHe cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to obey\\nsome of nature’s laws--why we know not. He may not enter anywhere at the\\nfirst, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come;\\nthough afterwards he can come as he please. His power ceases, as does\\nthat of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain times\\ncan he have limited freedom. If he be not at the place whither he is\\nbound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset.\\nThese things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by\\ninference. Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when he\\nhave his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the place\\nunhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at\\nWhitby; still at other time he can only change when the time come. It is\\nsaid, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood\\nof the tide. Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no\\npower, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this\\nsymbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to\\nthem he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and\\nsilent with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of,\\nlest in our seeking we may need them. The branch of wild rose on his\\ncoffin keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the\\ncoffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake through\\nhim, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest.\\nWe have seen it with our eyes.\\n\\n“Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine\\nhim to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know. But he is\\nclever. I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to\\nmake his record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what he\\nhas been. He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his\\nname against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of\\nTurkey-land. If it be so, then was he no common man; for in that time,\\nand for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most\\ncunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the ‘land beyond the\\nforest.’ That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his\\ngrave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculas were, says\\nArminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who\\nwere held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. They\\nlearned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake\\nHermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. In the\\nrecords are such words as ‘stregoica’--witch, ‘ordog,’ and\\n‘pokol’--Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very Dracula is\\nspoken of as ‘wampyr,’ which we all understand too well. There have been\\nfrom the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their\\ngraves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell. For it\\nis not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in\\nall good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest.”\\n\\nWhilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the window,\\nand he now got up quietly, and went out of the room. There was a little\\npause, and then the Professor went on:--\\n\\n“And now we must settle what we do. We have here much data, and we must\\nproceed to lay out our campaign. We know from the inquiry of Jonathan\\nthat from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which\\nwere delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these boxes\\nhave been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be to\\nascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall\\nwhere we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed. If the\\nlatter, we must trace----”\\n\\nHere we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house came\\nthe sound of a pistol-shot; the glass of the window was shattered with a\\nbullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck the\\nfar wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked\\nout. The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew over to the\\nwindow and threw up the sash. As he did so we heard Mr. Morris’s voice\\nwithout:--\\n\\n“Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you about\\nit.” A minute later he came in and said:--\\n\\n“It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs.\\nHarker, most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly. But\\nthe fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big bat\\nand sat on the window-sill. I have got such a horror of the damned\\nbrutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to\\nhave a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings, whenever I have\\nseen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art.”\\n\\n“Did you hit it?” asked Dr. Van Helsing.\\n\\n“I don’t know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood.” Without\\nsaying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume his\\nstatement:--\\n\\n“We must trace each of these boxes; and when we are ready, we must\\neither capture or kill this monster in his lair; or we must, so to\\nspeak, sterilise the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it.\\nThus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of\\nnoon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most weak.\\n\\n“And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well.\\nYou are too precious to us to have such risk. When we part to-night, you\\nno more must question. We shall tell you all in good time. We are men\\nand are able to bear; but you must be our star and our hope, and we\\nshall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as we\\nare.”\\n\\nAll the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved; but it did not seem to me\\ngood that they should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen their\\nsafety--strength being the best safety--through care of me; but their\\nminds were made up, and, though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow,\\nI could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me.\\n\\nMr. Morris resumed the discussion:--\\n\\n“As there is no time to lose, I vote we have a look at his house right\\nnow. Time is everything with him; and swift action on our part may save\\nanother victim.”\\n\\nI own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so\\nclose, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if I\\nappeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave\\nme out of their counsels altogether. They have now gone off to Carfax,\\nwith means to get into the house.\\n\\nManlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep; as if a woman can\\nsleep when those she loves are in danger! I shall lie down and pretend\\nto sleep, lest Jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns.\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n_1 October, 4 a. m._--Just as we were about to leave the house, an\\nurgent message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see\\nhim at once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me.\\nI told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the\\nmorning; I was busy just at the moment. The attendant added:--\\n\\n“He seems very importunate, sir. I have never seen him so eager. I don’t\\nknow but what, if you don’t see him soon, he will have one of his\\nviolent fits.” I knew the man would not have said this without some\\ncause, so I said: “All right; I’ll go now”; and I asked the others to\\nwait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my “patient.”\\n\\n“Take me with you, friend John,” said the Professor. “His case in your\\ndiary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on _our_\\ncase. I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is\\ndisturbed.”\\n\\n“May I come also?” asked Lord Godalming.\\n\\n“Me too?” said Quincey Morris. “May I come?” said Harker. I nodded, and\\nwe all went down the passage together.\\n\\nWe found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more\\nrational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him. There was an\\nunusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had ever\\nmet with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons would\\nprevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into the room, but\\nnone of the others at first said anything. His request was that I would\\nat once release him from the asylum and send him home. This he backed up\\nwith arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own\\nexisting sanity. “I appeal to your friends,” he said, “they will,\\nperhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. By the way, you have\\nnot introduced me.” I was so much astonished, that the oddness of\\nintroducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment; and,\\nbesides, there was a certain dignity in the man’s manner, so much of\\nthe habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction: “Lord\\nGodalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas; Mr.\\nRenfield.” He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:--\\n\\n“Lord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at the\\nWindham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no\\nmore. He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in his\\nyouth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much\\npatronised on Derby night. Mr. Morris, you should be proud of your great\\nstate. Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may have\\nfar-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold\\nalliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of Treaty may yet prove a\\nvast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true\\nplace as a political fable. What shall any man say of his pleasure at\\nmeeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of\\nconventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics\\nby his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter,\\nconventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to\\none of a class. You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by\\nthe possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective\\nplaces in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at\\nleast the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties.\\nAnd I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as\\nwell as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to\\nbe considered as under exceptional circumstances.” He made this last\\nappeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own\\ncharm.\\n\\nI think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under the\\nconviction, despite my knowledge of the man’s character and history,\\nthat his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse to\\ntell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the\\nnecessary formalities for his release in the morning. I thought it\\nbetter to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old\\nI knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable.\\nSo I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared\\nto be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with him\\nin the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction of\\nmeeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he said\\nquickly:--\\n\\n“But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. I desire to\\ngo at once--here--now--this very hour--this very moment, if I may. Time\\npresses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of\\nthe essence of the contract. I am sure it is only necessary to put\\nbefore so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so\\nmomentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment.” He looked at me keenly, and\\nseeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised\\nthem closely. Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on:--\\n\\n“Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition?”\\n\\n“You have,” I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally.\\nThere was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly:--\\n\\n“Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let me ask for\\nthis concession--boon, privilege, what you will. I am content to implore\\nin such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. I\\nam not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, I\\nassure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound and\\nunselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. Could you look,\\nsir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments which\\nanimate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest of\\nyour friends.” Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a growing\\nconviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was\\nbut yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to let\\nhim go on a little longer, knowing from experience that he would, like\\nall lunatics, give himself away in the end. Van Helsing was gazing at\\nhim with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting\\nwith the fixed concentration of his look. He said to Renfield in a tone\\nwhich did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of it\\nafterwards--for it was as of one addressing an equal:--\\n\\n“Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free\\nto-night? I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me--a stranger,\\nwithout prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind--Dr.\\nSeward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the\\nprivilege you seek.” He shook his head sadly, and with a look of\\npoignant regret on his face. The Professor went on:--\\n\\n“Come, sir, bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in the\\nhighest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete\\nreasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since\\nyou are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. If\\nyou will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can\\nwe perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? Be wise, and help\\nus; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish.” He still shook\\nhis head as he said:--\\n\\n“Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say. Your argument is complete, and\\nif I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment; but I am not my\\nown master in the matter. I can only ask you to trust me. If I am\\nrefused, the responsibility does not rest with me.” I thought it was now\\ntime to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I went\\ntowards the door, simply saying:--\\n\\n“Come, my friends, we have work to do. Good-night.”\\n\\nAs, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. He\\nmoved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was\\nabout to make another homicidal attack. My fears, however, were\\ngroundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his\\npetition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of his\\nemotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old\\nrelations, he became still more demonstrative. I glanced at Van Helsing,\\nand saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little more\\nfixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his\\nefforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of the same\\nconstantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of\\nwhich at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when he\\nwanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same\\nsullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised,\\nfor, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into\\nquite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held up\\nhis hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a\\ntorrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his\\nwhole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:--\\n\\n“Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out\\nof this house at once. Send me away how you will and where you will;\\nsend keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me in a\\nstrait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let me go\\nout of this. You don’t know what you do by keeping me here. I am\\nspeaking from the depths of my heart--of my very soul. You don’t know\\nwhom you wrong, or how; and I may not tell. Woe is me! I may not tell.\\nBy all you hold sacred--by all you hold dear--by your love that is\\nlost--by your hope that lives--for the sake of the Almighty, take me out\\nof this and save my soul from guilt! Can’t you hear me, man? Can’t you\\nunderstand? Will you never learn? Don’t you know that I am sane and\\nearnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting\\nfor his soul? Oh, hear me! hear me! Let me go! let me go! let me go!”\\n\\nI thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so\\nwould bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up.\\n\\n“Come,” I said sternly, “no more of this; we have had quite enough\\nalready. Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly.”\\n\\nHe suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments. Then,\\nwithout a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the\\nbed. The collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as I had\\nexpected.\\n\\nWhen I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a\\nquiet, well-bred voice:--\\n\\n“You will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind, later\\non, that I did what I could to convince you to-night.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX\\n\\nJONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL\\n\\n\\n_1 October, 5 a. m._--I went with the party to the search with an easy\\nmind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well. I am\\nso glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work.\\nSomehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at\\nall; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and\\nbrains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way\\nthat every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, and\\nthat she can henceforth leave the rest to us. We were, I think, all a\\nlittle upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield. When we came away from his\\nroom we were silent till we got back to the study. Then Mr. Morris said\\nto Dr. Seward:--\\n\\n“Say, Jack, if that man wasn’t attempting a bluff, he is about the\\nsanest lunatic I ever saw. I’m not sure, but I believe that he had some\\nserious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a\\nchance.” Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added:--\\n\\n“Friend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I’m glad of it,\\nfor I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last\\nhysterical outburst have given him free. But we live and learn, and in\\nour present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say.\\nAll is best as they are.” Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a\\ndreamy kind of way:--\\n\\n“I don’t know but that I agree with you. If that man had been an\\nordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but he\\nseems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am\\nafraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. I can’t forget how\\nhe prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear my\\nthroat out with his teeth. Besides, he called the Count ‘lord and\\nmaster,’ and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way.\\nThat horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help\\nhim, so I suppose he isn’t above trying to use a respectable lunatic. He\\ncertainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what is\\nbest. These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand,\\nhelp to unnerve a man.” The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand\\non his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:--\\n\\n“Friend John, have no fear. We are trying to do our duty in a very sad\\nand terrible case; we can only do as we deem best. What else have we to\\nhope for, except the pity of the good God?” Lord Godalming had slipped\\naway for a few minutes, but now he returned. He held up a little silver\\nwhistle, as he remarked:--\\n\\n“That old place may be full of rats, and if so, I’ve got an antidote on\\ncall.” Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care\\nto keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone\\nout. When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took out\\na lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four\\nlittle groups, evidently one for each. Then he spoke:--\\n\\n“My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of\\nmany kinds. Our enemy is not merely spiritual. Remember that he has the\\nstrength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are\\nof the common kind--and therefore breakable or crushable--his are not\\namenable to mere strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strong\\nin all than him, can at certain times hold him; but they cannot hurt him\\nas we can be hurt by him. We must, therefore, guard ourselves from his\\ntouch. Keep this near your heart”--as he spoke he lifted a little silver\\ncrucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him--“put these\\nflowers round your neck”--here he handed to me a wreath of withered\\ngarlic blossoms--“for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this\\nknife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can\\nfasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this,\\nwhich we must not desecrate needless.” This was a portion of Sacred\\nWafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me. Each of the others\\nwas similarly equipped. “Now,” he said, “friend John, where are the\\nskeleton keys? If so that we can open the door, we need not break house\\nby the window, as before at Miss Lucy’s.”\\n\\nDr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a\\nsurgeon standing him in good stead. Presently he got one to suit; after\\na little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty\\nclang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and\\nit slowly opened. It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in\\nDr. Seward’s diary of the opening of Miss Westenra’s tomb; I fancy that\\nthe same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they\\nshrank back. The Professor was the first to move forward, and stepped\\ninto the open door.\\n\\n“_In manus tuas, Domine!_” he said, crossing himself as he passed over\\nthe threshold. We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have\\nlit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road. The\\nProfessor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it\\nfrom within should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit our\\nlamps and proceeded on our search.\\n\\nThe light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the\\nrays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great\\nshadows. I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there\\nwas some one else amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, so\\npowerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible\\nexperience in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common to us all,\\nfor I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every\\nsound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.\\n\\nThe whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly inches\\ndeep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down\\nmy lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked. The\\nwalls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of\\nspider’s webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old\\ntattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. On a table in the\\nhall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each. They\\nhad been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents\\nin the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the Professor\\nlifted them. He turned to me and said:--\\n\\n“You know this place, Jonathan. You have copied maps of it, and you know\\nit at least more than we do. Which is the way to the chapel?” I had an\\nidea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been able to\\nget admission to it; so I led the way, and after a few wrong turnings\\nfound myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands.\\n“This is the spot,” said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a small\\nmap of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence\\nregarding the purchase. With a little trouble we found the key on the\\nbunch and opened the door. We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for\\nas we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale\\nthrough the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we\\nencountered. None of the others had met the Count at all at close\\nquarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of\\nhis existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, in\\na ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small and\\nclose, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. There was\\nan earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler\\nair. But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was not\\nalone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the\\npungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had\\nbecome itself corrupt. Faugh! it sickens me to think of it. Every breath\\nexhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and\\nintensified its loathsomeness.\\n\\nUnder ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our\\nenterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high and\\nterrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose\\nabove merely physical considerations. After the involuntary shrinking\\nconsequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our\\nwork as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.\\n\\nWe made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as we\\nbegan:--\\n\\n“The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then\\nexamine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some\\nclue as to what has become of the rest.” A glance was sufficient to show\\nhow many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was\\nno mistaking them.\\n\\nThere were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once I got a fright,\\nfor, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted\\ndoor into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my\\nheart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to\\nsee the high lights of the Count’s evil face, the ridge of the nose, the\\nred eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a moment, for,\\nas Lord Godalming said, “I thought I saw a face, but it was only the\\nshadows,” and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction,\\nand stepped into the passage. There was no sign of any one; and as there\\nwere no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid\\nwalls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for _him_. I\\ntook it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.\\n\\nA few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which\\nhe was examining. We all followed his movements with our eyes, for\\nundoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass\\nof phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. We all instinctively drew\\nback. The whole place was becoming alive with rats.\\n\\nFor a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was\\nseemingly prepared for such an emergency. Rushing over to the great\\niron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside,\\nand which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the\\nhuge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking his little silver\\nwhistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answered\\nfrom behind Dr. Seward’s house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a\\nminute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house.\\nUnconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I\\nnoticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been\\ntaken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that had\\nelapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They seemed to\\nswarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their\\nmoving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look\\nlike a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at the\\nthreshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting\\ntheir noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats were\\nmultiplying in thousands, and we moved out.\\n\\nLord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him\\non the floor. The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to\\nrecover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled before\\nhim so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other\\ndogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey\\nere the whole mass had vanished.\\n\\nWith their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for\\nthe dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at\\ntheir prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in\\nthe air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise.\\nWhether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of\\nthe chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves\\nin the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to\\nslip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something\\nof its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our\\nresolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and\\nbringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We found\\nnothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all\\nuntouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit.\\nNever once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when\\nwe returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been\\nrabbit-hunting in a summer wood.\\n\\nThe morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front.\\nDr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, and\\nlocked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket\\nwhen he had done.\\n\\n“So far,” he said, “our night has been eminently successful. No harm has\\ncome to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how\\nmany boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, our\\nfirst--and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous--step has been\\naccomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or\\ntroubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and\\nsmells of horror which she might never forget. One lesson, too, we have\\nlearned, if it be allowable to argue _a particulari_: that the brute\\nbeasts which are to the Count’s command are yet themselves not amenable\\nto his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his\\ncall, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and\\nto that poor mother’s cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell\\nfrom the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have other matters\\nbefore us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster--he has not used\\nhis power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night.\\nSo be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity\\nto cry ‘check’ in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the\\nstake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is close at hand,\\nand we have reason to be content with our first night’s work. It may be\\nordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril;\\nbut we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink.”\\n\\nThe house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who\\nwas screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound\\nfrom Renfield’s room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself,\\nafter the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.\\n\\nI came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so\\nsoftly that I had to put my ear down to hear it. She looks paler than\\nusual. I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her. I am truly\\nthankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our\\ndeliberations. It is too great a strain for a woman to bear. I did not\\nthink so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that it is\\nsettled. There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yet\\nto conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she\\nsuspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our work is to be a\\nsealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all\\nis finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world. I\\ndaresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such\\nconfidence as ours; but I must be resolute, and to-morrow I shall keep\\ndark over to-night’s doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that\\nhas happened. I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_1 October, later._--I suppose it was natural that we should have all\\noverslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had no\\nrest at all. Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I slept\\ntill the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two or\\nthree times before she awoke. Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for a\\nfew seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me with a sort of\\nblank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream. She\\ncomplained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till later in the\\nday. We now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it be\\nthat several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace\\nthem all. Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labour, and the\\nsooner the matter is attended to the better. I shall look up Thomas\\nSnelling to-day.\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n_1 October._--It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor\\nwalking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it\\nis quite evident that last night’s work has helped to take some of the\\nbrooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of the\\nnight he suddenly said:--\\n\\n“Your patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit him\\nthis morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may\\nbe. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy,\\nand reason so sound.” I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him\\nthat if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to\\nkeep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary\\ninstructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against\\ngetting any false impression from my patient. “But,” he answered, “I\\nwant him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live\\nthings. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that\\nhe had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?”\\n\\n“Excuse me,” I said, “but the answer is here.” I laid my hand on the\\ntype-written matter. “When our sane and learned lunatic made that very\\nstatement of how he _used_ to consume life, his mouth was actually\\nnauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs.\\nHarker entered the room.” Van Helsing smiled in turn. “Good!” he said.\\n“Your memory is true, friend John. I should have remembered. And yet it\\nis this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease\\nsuch a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the\\nfolly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise.\\nWho knows?” I went on with my work, and before long was through that in\\nhand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was\\nVan Helsing back in the study. “Do I interrupt?” he asked politely as he\\nstood at the door.\\n\\n“Not at all,” I answered. “Come in. My work is finished, and I am free.\\nI can go with you now, if you like.\\n\\n“It is needless; I have seen him!”\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\n“I fear that he does not appraise me at much. Our interview was short.\\nWhen I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, with\\nhis elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen\\ndiscontent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a\\nmeasure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever. “Don’t\\nyou know me?” I asked. His answer was not reassuring: “I know you well\\nenough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you would take yourself\\nand your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all thick-headed\\nDutchmen!” Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacable\\nsullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at\\nall. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so\\nclever lunatic; so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few\\nhappy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina. Friend John, it does\\nrejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained, no more to be\\nworried with our terrible things. Though we shall much miss her help, it\\nis better so.”\\n\\n“I agree with you with all my heart,” I answered earnestly, for I did\\nnot want him to weaken in this matter. “Mrs. Harker is better out of it.\\nThings are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have\\nbeen in many tight places in our time; but it is no place for a woman,\\nand if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in time\\ninfallibly have wrecked her.”\\n\\nSo Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker and Harker; Quincey\\nand Art are all out following up the clues as to the earth-boxes. I\\nshall finish my round of work and we shall meet to-night.\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker’s Journal._\\n\\n_1 October._--It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am to-day;\\nafter Jonathan’s full confidence for so many years, to see him\\nmanifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. This\\nmorning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though\\nJonathan was late too, he was the earlier. He spoke to me before he went\\nout, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word of\\nwhat had happened in the visit to the Count’s house. And yet he must\\nhave known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear fellow! I suppose it\\nmust have distressed him even more than it did me. They all agreed that\\nit was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work, and\\nI acquiesced. But to think that he keeps anything from me! And now I am\\ncrying like a silly fool, when I _know_ it comes from my husband’s great\\nlove and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men.\\n\\nThat has done me good. Well, some day Jonathan will tell me all; and\\nlest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that I kept\\nanything from him, I still keep my journal as usual. Then if he has\\nfeared of my trust I shall show it to him, with every thought of my\\nheart put down for his dear eyes to read. I feel strangely sad and\\nlow-spirited to-day. I suppose it is the reaction from the terrible\\nexcitement.\\n\\nLast night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they told\\nme to. I didn’t feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring anxiety. I\\nkept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to\\nsee me in London, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate\\npressing on relentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one does\\nseems, no matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing which\\nis most to be deplored. If I hadn’t gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dear\\nLucy would be with us now. She hadn’t taken to visiting the churchyard\\ntill I came, and if she hadn’t come there in the day-time with me she\\nwouldn’t have walked there in her sleep; and if she hadn’t gone there at\\nnight and asleep, that monster couldn’t have destroyed her as he did.\\nOh, why did I ever go to Whitby? There now, crying again! I wonder what\\nhas come over me to-day. I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew\\nthat I had been crying twice in one morning--I, who never cried on my\\nown account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear--the dear\\nfellow would fret his heart out. I shall put a bold face on, and if I do\\nfeel weepy, he shall never see it. I suppose it is one of the lessons\\nthat we poor women have to learn....\\n\\nI can’t quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearing\\nthe sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying\\non a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield’s room, which is somewhere\\nunder this. And then there was silence over everything, silence so\\nprofound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window.\\nAll was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight\\nseeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a thing seemed to be\\nstirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that a thin\\nstreak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness\\nacross the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a\\nvitality of its own. I think that the digression of my thoughts must\\nhave done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy\\ncreeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out\\nand looked out of the window again. The mist was spreading, and was now\\nclose up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the\\nwall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. The poor man was\\nmore loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said,\\nI could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on\\nhis part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the\\nattendants were dealing with him. I was so frightened that I crept into\\nbed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears.\\nI was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but I must have\\nfallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until the\\nmorning, when Jonathan woke me. I think that it took me an effort and a\\nlittle time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was\\nbending over me. My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of\\nthe way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.\\n\\nI thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. I\\nwas very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and my\\nhands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the\\nusual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn\\nupon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the\\nclothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim\\naround. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down,\\ncame only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently\\ngrown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that I\\nhad shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out to\\nmake certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my\\nlimbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was all. I closed\\nmy eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonderful what\\ntricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) The\\nmist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I\\ncould see it like smoke--or with the white energy of boiling\\nwater--pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of\\nthe door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became\\nconcentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top\\nof which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Things\\nbegan to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now\\nwhirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words “a\\npillar of cloud by day and of fire by night.” Was it indeed some such\\nspiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar was\\ncomposed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the\\nred eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as I\\nlooked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like\\ntwo red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering\\nwhen, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary’s\\nChurch. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan\\nhad seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist\\nin the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became\\nblack darkness. The last conscious effort which imagination made was to\\nshow me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must be\\ncareful of such dreams, for they would unseat one’s reason if there were\\ntoo much of them. I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe\\nsomething for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm\\nthem. Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their\\nfears for me. To-night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If I do\\nnot, I shall to-morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral; that\\ncannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good night’s sleep. Last\\nnight tired me more than if I had not slept at all.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_2 October 10 p. m._--Last night I slept, but did not dream. I must have\\nslept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed; but the\\nsleep has not refreshed me, for to-day I feel terribly weak and\\nspiritless. I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing.\\nIn the afternoon Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me. Poor man, he was\\nvery gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God bless\\nme. Some way it affected me much; I am crying when I think of him. This\\nis a new weakness, of which I must be careful. Jonathan would be\\nmiserable if he knew I had been crying. He and the others were out till\\ndinner-time, and they all came in tired. I did what I could to brighten\\nthem up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot how\\ntired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke\\ntogether, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each other\\nof what had occurred to each during the day; I could see from Jonathan’s\\nmanner that he had something important to communicate. I was not so\\nsleepy as I should have been; so before they went I asked Dr. Seward to\\ngive me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the night\\nbefore. He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave to\\nme, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild.... I\\nhave taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. I hope\\nI have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear\\ncomes: that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the\\npower of waking. I might want it. Here comes sleep. Good-night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX\\n\\nJONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL\\n\\n\\n_1 October, evening._--I found Thomas Snelling in his house at Bethnal\\nGreen, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything. The\\nvery prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had\\nproved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch. I\\nlearned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that he\\nwas only the assistant to Smollet, who of the two mates was the\\nresponsible person. So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr. Joseph\\nSmollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a\\nsaucer. He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliable\\ntype of workman, and with a headpiece of his own. He remembered all\\nabout the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog’s-eared\\nnotebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the\\nseat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick,\\nhalf-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes. There\\nwere, he said, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at\\n197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which he\\ndeposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. If then the Count meant to\\nscatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these places were\\nchosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might distribute more\\nfully. The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that\\nhe could not mean to confine himself to two sides of London. He was now\\nfixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern\\nshore, and on the south. The north and west were surely never meant to\\nbe left out of his diabolical scheme--let alone the City itself and the\\nvery heart of fashionable London in the south-west and west. I went back\\nto Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had\\nbeen taken from Carfax.\\n\\nHe replied:--\\n\\n“Well, guv’nor, you’ve treated me wery ’an’some”--I had given him half a\\nsovereign--“an’ I’ll tell yer all I know. I heard a man by the name of\\nBloxam say four nights ago in the ’Are an’ ’Ounds, in Pincher’s Alley,\\nas ’ow he an’ his mate ’ad ’ad a rare dusty job in a old ’ouse at\\nPurfect. There ain’t a-many such jobs as this ’ere, an’ I’m thinkin’\\nthat maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut.” I asked if he could tell me\\nwhere to find him. I told him that if he could get me the address it\\nwould be worth another half-sovereign to him. So he gulped down the rest\\nof his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the search\\nthen and there. At the door he stopped, and said:--\\n\\n“Look ’ere, guv’nor, there ain’t no sense in me a-keepin’ you ’ere. I\\nmay find Sam soon, or I mayn’t; but anyhow he ain’t like to be in a way\\nto tell ye much to-night. Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze.\\nIf you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address on\\nit, I’ll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye to-night. But\\nye’d better be up arter ’im soon in the mornin’, or maybe ye won’t ketch\\n’im; for Sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore.”\\n\\nThis was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to\\nbuy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When she\\ncame back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet had\\nagain faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my way\\nto home. We’re on the track anyhow. I am tired to-night, and want sleep.\\nMina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; her eyes look as\\nthough she had been crying. Poor dear, I’ve no doubt it frets her to be\\nkept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the\\nothers. But it is best as it is. It is better to be disappointed and\\nworried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken. The doctors\\nwere quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful\\nbusiness. I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silence\\nmust rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any\\ncircumstances. Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for she\\nherself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the\\nCount or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_2 October, evening._--A long and trying and exciting day. By the first\\npost I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on\\nwhich was written with a carpenter’s pencil in a sprawling hand:--\\n\\n“Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Arsk for\\nthe depite.”\\n\\nI got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina. She looked heavy\\nand sleepy and pale, and far from well. I determined not to wake her,\\nbut that, when I should return from this new search, I would arrange for\\nher going back to Exeter. I think she would be happier in our own home,\\nwith her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us and\\nin ignorance. I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and told him where I\\nwas off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I should\\nhave found out anything. I drove to Walworth and found, with some\\ndifficulty, Potter’s Court. Mr. Smollet’s spelling misled me, as I asked\\nfor Poter’s Court instead of Potter’s Court. However, when I had found\\nthe court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran’s lodging-house.\\nWhen I asked the man who came to the door for the “depite,” he shook his\\nhead, and said: “I dunno ’im. There ain’t no such a person ’ere; I never\\n’eard of ’im in all my bloomin’ days. Don’t believe there ain’t nobody\\nof that kind livin’ ere or anywheres.” I took out Smollet’s letter, and\\nas I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name\\nof the court might guide me. “What are you?” I asked.\\n\\n“I’m the depity,” he answered. I saw at once that I was on the right\\ntrack; phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half-crown tip put the\\ndeputy’s knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who\\nhad slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at\\nCorcoran’s, had left for his work at Poplar at five o’clock that\\nmorning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but\\nhe had a vague idea that it was some kind of a “new-fangled ware’us”;\\nand with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelve\\no’clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this\\nI got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner. One\\nof these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a\\nnew “cold storage” building; and as this suited the condition of a\\n“new-fangled ware’us,” I at once drove to it. An interview with a surly\\ngatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the\\ncoin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for on my\\nsuggesting that I was willing to pay his day’s wages to his foreman for\\nthe privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter. He was\\na smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. When I had\\npromised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me\\nthat he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly,\\nand had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes--“main\\nheavy ones”--with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. I\\nasked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to\\nwhich he replied:--\\n\\n“Well, guv’nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from a\\nbig white church or somethink of the kind, not long built. It was a\\ndusty old ’ouse, too, though nothin’ to the dustiness of the ’ouse we\\ntooked the bloomin’ boxes from.”\\n\\n“How did you get into the houses if they were both empty?”\\n\\n“There was the old party what engaged me a-waitin’ in the ’ouse at\\nPurfleet. He ’elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray. Curse\\nme, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an’ him a old feller,\\nwith a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn’t throw\\na shadder.”\\n\\nHow this phrase thrilled through me!\\n\\n“Why, ’e took up ’is end o’ the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and\\nme a-puffin’ an’ a-blowin’ afore I could up-end mine anyhow--an’ I’m no\\nchicken, neither.”\\n\\n“How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?” I asked.\\n\\n“He was there too. He must ’a’ started off and got there afore me, for\\nwhen I rung of the bell he kem an’ opened the door ’isself an’ ’elped me\\nto carry the boxes into the ’all.”\\n\\n“The whole nine?” I asked.\\n\\n“Yus; there was five in the first load an’ four in the second. It was\\nmain dry work, an’ I don’t so well remember ’ow I got ’ome.” I\\ninterrupted him:--\\n\\n“Were the boxes left in the hall?”\\n\\n“Yus; it was a big ’all, an’ there was nothin’ else in it.” I made one\\nmore attempt to further matters:--\\n\\n“You didn’t have any key?”\\n\\n“Never used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he opened the door ’isself\\nan’ shut it again when I druv off. I don’t remember the last time--but\\nthat was the beer.”\\n\\n“And you can’t remember the number of the house?”\\n\\n“No, sir. But ye needn’t have no difficulty about that. It’s a ’igh ’un\\nwith a stone front with a bow on it, an’ ’igh steps up to the door. I\\nknow them steps, ’avin’ ’ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers\\nwhat come round to earn a copper. The old gent give them shillin’s, an’\\nthey seein’ they got so much, they wanted more; but ’e took one of them\\nby the shoulder and was like to throw ’im down the steps, till the lot\\nof them went away cussin’.” I thought that with this description I could\\nfind the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I started\\noff for Piccadilly. I had gained a new painful experience; the Count\\ncould, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. If so, time was\\nprecious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount of\\ndistribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task\\nunobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked\\nwestward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house\\ndescribed, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs\\narranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had been long\\nuntenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were\\nup. All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint\\nhad mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to lately there had been\\na large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been\\nroughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining.\\nBehind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards,\\nwhose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to have\\nbeen able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have\\ngiven some clue to the ownership of the house. I remembered my\\nexperience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not\\nbut feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means\\ndiscovered of gaining access to the house.\\n\\nThere was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, and\\nnothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if anything\\ncould be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active, the\\nPiccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of the\\ngrooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything\\nabout the empty house. One of them said that he heard it had lately been\\ntaken, but he couldn’t say from whom. He told me, however, that up to\\nvery lately there had been a notice-board of “For Sale” up, and that\\nperhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell me\\nsomething, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on\\nthe board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know\\nor guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled\\naway. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so I\\ndid not lose any time. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, &\\nCandy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in\\nSackville Street.\\n\\nThe gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but\\nuncommunicative in equal proportion. Having once told me that the\\nPiccadilly house--which throughout our interview he called a\\n“mansion”--was sold, he considered my business as concluded. When I\\nasked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and\\npaused a few seconds before replying:--\\n\\n“It is sold, sir.”\\n\\n“Pardon me,” I said, with equal politeness, “but I have a special reason\\nfor wishing to know who purchased it.”\\n\\nAgain he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more. “It is sold,\\nsir,” was again his laconic reply.\\n\\n“Surely,” I said, “you do not mind letting me know so much.”\\n\\n“But I do mind,” he answered. “The affairs of their clients are\\nabsolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy.” This was\\nmanifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with\\nhim. I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:--\\n\\n“Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their\\nconfidence. I am myself a professional man.” Here I handed him my card.\\n“In this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act on the part of\\nLord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was,\\nhe understood, lately for sale.” These words put a different complexion\\non affairs. He said:--\\n\\n“I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker, and especially would\\nI like to oblige his lordship. We once carried out a small matter of\\nrenting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable Arthur\\nHolmwood. If you will let me have his lordship’s address I will consult\\nthe House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his\\nlordship by to-night’s post. It will be a pleasure if we can so far\\ndeviate from our rules as to give the required information to his\\nlordship.”\\n\\nI wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him,\\ngave the address at Dr. Seward’s and came away. It was now dark, and I\\nwas tired and hungry. I got a cup of tea at the Aërated Bread Company\\nand came down to Purfleet by the next train.\\n\\nI found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale, but she\\nmade a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart to\\nthink that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused her\\ninquietude. Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking on at\\nour conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our\\nconfidence. It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of\\nkeeping her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more reconciled; or\\nelse the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when\\nany accidental allusion is made she actually shudders. I am glad we\\nmade our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growing\\nknowledge would be torture to her.\\n\\nI could not tell the others of the day’s discovery till we were alone;\\nso after dinner--followed by a little music to save appearances even\\namongst ourselves--I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed.\\nThe dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me\\nas though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and I\\ncame away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no\\ndifference between us.\\n\\nWhen I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in\\nthe study. In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply read\\nit off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own\\ninformation; when I had finished Van Helsing said:--\\n\\n“This has been a great day’s work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we are on\\nthe track of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that house, then\\nour work is near the end. But if there be some missing, we must search\\nuntil we find them. Then shall we make our final _coup_, and hunt the\\nwretch to his real death.” We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr.\\nMorris spoke:--\\n\\n“Say! how are we going to get into that house?”\\n\\n“We got into the other,” answered Lord Godalming quickly.\\n\\n“But, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax, but we had night\\nand a walled park to protect us. It will be a mighty different thing to\\ncommit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night. I confess I don’t\\nsee how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key\\nof some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the\\nmorning.” Lord Godalming’s brows contracted, and he stood up and walked\\nabout the room. By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one to\\nanother of us:--\\n\\n“Quincey’s head is level. This burglary business is getting serious; we\\ngot off once all right; but we have now a rare job on hand--unless we\\ncan find the Count’s key basket.”\\n\\nAs nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at\\nleast advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchell’s,\\nwe decided not to take any active step before breakfast time. For a good\\nwhile we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and\\nbearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the\\nmoment. I am very sleepy and shall go to bed....\\n\\nJust a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular. Her\\nforehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even\\nin her sleep. She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as she\\ndid this morning. To-morrow will, I hope, mend all this; she will be\\nherself at home in Exeter. Oh, but I am sleepy!\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n_1 October._--I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods change so\\nrapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they\\nalways mean something more than his own well-being, they form a more\\nthan interesting study. This morning, when I went to see him after his\\nrepulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny.\\nHe was, in fact, commanding destiny--subjectively. He did not really\\ncare for any of the things of mere earth; he was in the clouds and\\nlooked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. I\\nthought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked\\nhim:--\\n\\n“What about the flies these times?” He smiled on me in quite a superior\\nsort of way--such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio--as\\nhe answered me:--\\n\\n“The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typical\\nof the aërial powers of the psychic faculties. The ancients did well\\nwhen they typified the soul as a butterfly!”\\n\\nI thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said\\nquickly:--\\n\\n“Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?” His madness foiled his\\nreason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head\\nwith a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said:--\\n\\n“Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want.” Here he brightened\\nup; “I am pretty indifferent about it at present. Life is all right; I\\nhave all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to\\nstudy zoöphagy!”\\n\\nThis puzzled me a little, so I drew him on:--\\n\\n“Then you command life; you are a god, I suppose?” He smiled with an\\nineffably benign superiority.\\n\\n“Oh no! Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the\\nDeity. I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings. If I\\nmay state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things\\npurely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied\\nspiritually!” This was a poser to me. I could not at the moment recall\\nEnoch’s appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt\\nthat by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:--\\n\\n“And why with Enoch?”\\n\\n“Because he walked with God.” I could not see the analogy, but did not\\nlike to admit it; so I harked back to what he had denied:--\\n\\n“So you don’t care about life and you don’t want souls. Why not?” I put\\nmy question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him.\\nThe effort succeeded; for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his\\nold servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me as\\nhe replied:--\\n\\n“I don’t want any souls, indeed, indeed! I don’t. I couldn’t use them if\\nI had them; they would be no manner of use to me. I couldn’t eat them\\nor----” He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his\\nface, like a wind-sweep on the surface of the water. “And doctor, as to\\nlife, what is it after all? When you’ve got all you require, and you\\nknow that you will never want, that is all. I have friends--good\\nfriends--like you, Dr. Seward”; this was said with a leer of\\ninexpressible cunning. “I know that I shall never lack the means of\\nlife!”\\n\\nI think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some\\nantagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such as\\nhe--a dogged silence. After a short time I saw that for the present it\\nwas useless to speak to him. He was sulky, and so I came away.\\n\\nLater in the day he sent for me. Ordinarily I would not have come\\nwithout special reason, but just at present I am so interested in him\\nthat I would gladly make an effort. Besides, I am glad to have anything\\nto help to pass the time. Harker is out, following up clues; and so are\\nLord Godalming and Quincey. Van Helsing sits in my study poring over the\\nrecord prepared by the Harkers; he seems to think that by accurate\\nknowledge of all details he will light upon some clue. He does not wish\\nto be disturbed in the work, without cause. I would have taken him with\\nme to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse he\\nmight not care to go again. There was also another reason: Renfield\\nmight not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were\\nalone.\\n\\nI found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose\\nwhich is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part. When I\\ncame in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his\\nlips:--\\n\\n“What about souls?” It was evident then that my surmise had been\\ncorrect. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the\\nlunatic. I determined to have the matter out. “What about them\\nyourself?” I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all round\\nhim, and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspiration for\\nan answer.\\n\\n“I don’t want any souls!” he said in a feeble, apologetic way. The\\nmatter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it--to “be\\ncruel only to be kind.” So I said:--\\n\\n“You like life, and you want life?”\\n\\n“Oh yes! but that is all right; you needn’t worry about that!”\\n\\n“But,” I asked, “how are we to get the life without getting the soul\\nalso?” This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up:--\\n\\n“A nice time you’ll have some time when you’re flying out there, with\\nthe souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing\\nand twittering and miauing all round you. You’ve got their lives, you\\nknow, and you must put up with their souls!” Something seemed to affect\\nhis imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes,\\nscrewing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being\\nsoaped. There was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gave\\nme a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child--only a child,\\nthough the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. It\\nwas evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance,\\nand, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign\\nto himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and\\ngo with him. The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him,\\nspeaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears:--\\n\\n“Would you like some sugar to get your flies round again?” He seemed to\\nwake up all at once, and shook his head. With a laugh he replied:--\\n\\n“Not much! flies are poor things, after all!” After a pause he added,\\n“But I don’t want their souls buzzing round me, all the same.”\\n\\n“Or spiders?” I went on.\\n\\n“Blow spiders! What’s the use of spiders? There isn’t anything in them\\nto eat or”--he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbidden\\ntopic.\\n\\n“So, so!” I thought to myself, “this is the second time he has suddenly\\nstopped at the word ‘drink’; what does it mean?” Renfield seemed himself\\naware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to distract\\nmy attention from it:--\\n\\n“I don’t take any stock at all in such matters. ‘Rats and mice and such\\nsmall deer,’ as Shakespeare has it, ‘chicken-feed of the larder’ they\\nmight be called. I’m past all that sort of nonsense. You might as well\\nask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop-sticks, as to try to\\ninterest me about the lesser carnivora, when I know of what is before\\nme.”\\n\\n“I see,” I said. “You want big things that you can make your teeth meet\\nin? How would you like to breakfast on elephant?”\\n\\n“What ridiculous nonsense you are talking!” He was getting too wide\\nawake, so I thought I would press him hard. “I wonder,” I said\\nreflectively, “what an elephant’s soul is like!”\\n\\nThe effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his\\nhigh-horse and became a child again.\\n\\n“I don’t want an elephant’s soul, or any soul at all!” he said. For a\\nfew moments he sat despondently. Suddenly he jumped to his feet, with\\nhis eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. “To\\nhell with you and your souls!” he shouted. “Why do you plague me about\\nsouls? Haven’t I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me already,\\nwithout thinking of souls!” He looked so hostile that I thought he was\\nin for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle. The instant,\\nhowever, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically:--\\n\\n“Forgive me, Doctor; I forgot myself. You do not need any help. I am so\\nworried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable. If you only knew the\\nproblem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, and\\ntolerate, and pardon me. Pray do not put me in a strait-waistcoat. I\\nwant to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined. I am\\nsure you will understand!” He had evidently self-control; so when the\\nattendants came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew. Renfield\\nwatched them go; when the door was closed he said, with considerable\\ndignity and sweetness:--\\n\\n“Dr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me. Believe me that\\nI am very, very grateful to you!” I thought it well to leave him in this\\nmood, and so I came away. There is certainly something to ponder over in\\nthis man’s state. Several points seem to make what the American\\ninterviewer calls “a story,” if one could only get them in proper order.\\nHere they are:--\\n\\nWill not mention “drinking.”\\n\\nFears the thought of being burdened with the “soul” of anything.\\n\\nHas no dread of wanting “life” in the future.\\n\\nDespises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he dreads being\\nhaunted by their souls.\\n\\nLogically all these things point one way! he has assurance of some kind\\nthat he will acquire some higher life. He dreads the consequence--the\\nburden of a soul. Then it is a human life he looks to!\\n\\nAnd the assurance--?\\n\\nMerciful God! the Count has been to him, and there is some new scheme of\\nterror afoot!\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later._--I went after my round to Van Helsing and told him my\\nsuspicion. He grew very grave; and, after thinking the matter over for a\\nwhile asked me to take him to Renfield. I did so. As we came to the door\\nwe heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do in the time\\nwhich now seems so long ago. When we entered we saw with amazement that\\nhe had spread out his sugar as of old; the flies, lethargic with the\\nautumn, were beginning to buzz into the room. We tried to make him talk\\nof the subject of our previous conversation, but he would not attend. He\\nwent on with his singing, just as though we had not been present. He had\\ngot a scrap of paper and was folding it into a note-book. We had to come\\naway as ignorant as we went in.\\n\\nHis is a curious case indeed; we must watch him to-night.\\n\\n\\n_Letter, Mitchell, Sons and Candy to Lord Godalming._\\n\\n_“1 October._\\n\\n“My Lord,\\n\\n“We are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes. We beg, with\\nregard to the desire of your Lordship, expressed by Mr. Harker on your\\nbehalf, to supply the following information concerning the sale and\\npurchase of No. 347, Piccadilly. The original vendors are the executors\\nof the late Mr. Archibald Winter-Suffield. The purchaser is a foreign\\nnobleman, Count de Ville, who effected the purchase himself paying the\\npurchase money in notes ‘over the counter,’ if your Lordship will pardon\\nus using so vulgar an expression. Beyond this we know nothing whatever\\nof him.\\n\\n“We are, my Lord,\\n\\n“Your Lordship’s humble servants,\\n\\n“MITCHELL, SONS & CANDY.”\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n_2 October._--I placed a man in the corridor last night, and told him to\\nmake an accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfield’s room,\\nand gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he\\nwas to call me. After dinner, when we had all gathered round the fire\\nin the study--Mrs. Harker having gone to bed--we discussed the attempts\\nand discoveries of the day. Harker was the only one who had any result,\\nand we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one.\\n\\nBefore going to bed I went round to the patient’s room and looked in\\nthrough the observation trap. He was sleeping soundly, and his heart\\nrose and fell with regular respiration.\\n\\nThis morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnight\\nhe was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly. I asked him\\nif that was all; he replied that it was all he heard. There was\\nsomething about his manner so suspicious that I asked him point blank if\\nhe had been asleep. He denied sleep, but admitted to having “dozed” for\\na while. It is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are\\nwatched.\\n\\nTo-day Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and Quincey are\\nlooking after horses. Godalming thinks that it will be well to have\\nhorses always in readiness, for when we get the information which we\\nseek there will be no time to lose. We must sterilise all the imported\\nearth between sunrise and sunset; we shall thus catch the Count at his\\nweakest, and without a refuge to fly to. Van Helsing is off to the\\nBritish Museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine. The old\\nphysicians took account of things which their followers do not accept,\\nand the Professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be\\nuseful to us later.\\n\\nI sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in\\nstrait-waistcoats.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later._--We have met again. We seem at last to be on the track, and our\\nwork of to-morrow may be the beginning of the end. I wonder if\\nRenfield’s quiet has anything to do with this. His moods have so\\nfollowed the doings of the Count, that the coming destruction of the\\nmonster may be carried to him in some subtle way. If we could only get\\nsome hint as to what passed in his mind, between the time of my argument\\nwith him to-day and his resumption of fly-catching, it might afford us a\\nvaluable clue. He is now seemingly quiet for a spell.... Is he?---- That\\nwild yell seemed to come from his room....\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe attendant came bursting into my room and told me that Renfield had\\nsomehow met with some accident. He had heard him yell; and when he went\\nto him found him lying on his face on the floor, all covered with blood.\\nI must go at once....\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI\\n\\nDR. SEWARD’S DIARY\\n\\n\\n_3 October._--Let me put down with exactness all that happened, as well\\nas I can remember it, since last I made an entry. Not a detail that I\\ncan recall must be forgotten; in all calmness I must proceed.\\n\\nWhen I came to Renfield’s room I found him lying on the floor on his\\nleft side in a glittering pool of blood. When I went to move him, it\\nbecame at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries;\\nthere seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body\\nwhich marks even lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed I could see\\nthat it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the\\nfloor--indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood\\noriginated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as\\nwe turned him over:--\\n\\n“I think, sir, his back is broken. See, both his right arm and leg and\\nthe whole side of his face are paralysed.” How such a thing could have\\nhappened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. He seemed quite\\nbewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said:--\\n\\n“I can’t understand the two things. He could mark his face like that by\\nbeating his own head on the floor. I saw a young woman do it once at the\\nEversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. And I suppose he\\nmight have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward\\nkink. But for the life of me I can’t imagine how the two things\\noccurred. If his back was broke, he couldn’t beat his head; and if his\\nface was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of\\nit.” I said to him:--\\n\\n“Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. I want\\nhim without an instant’s delay.” The man ran off, and within a few\\nminutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. When\\nhe saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and\\nthen turned to me. I think he recognised my thought in my eyes, for he\\nsaid very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:--\\n\\n“Ah, a sad accident! He will need very careful watching, and much\\nattention. I shall stay with you myself; but I shall first dress myself.\\nIf you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you.”\\n\\nThe patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that\\nhe had suffered some terrible injury. Van Helsing returned with\\nextraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case. He had\\nevidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before he\\nlooked at the patient, he whispered to me:--\\n\\n“Send the attendant away. We must be alone with him when he becomes\\nconscious, after the operation.” So I said:--\\n\\n“I think that will do now, Simmons. We have done all that we can at\\npresent. You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate.\\nLet me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere.”\\n\\nThe man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient.\\nThe wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was a depressed\\nfracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. The\\nProfessor thought a moment and said:--\\n\\n“We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far\\nas can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of\\nhis injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The suffusion of the\\nbrain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be\\ntoo late.” As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. I\\nwent over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and\\nQuincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:--\\n\\n“I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident.\\nSo I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep. Things\\nare moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us\\nthese times. I’ve been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things\\nas they have been. We’ll have to look back--and forward a little more\\nthan we have done. May we come in?” I nodded, and held the door open\\ntill they had entered; then I closed it again. When Quincey saw the\\nattitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the\\nfloor, he said softly:--\\n\\n“My God! what has happened to him? Poor, poor devil!” I told him\\nbriefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after\\nthe operation--for a short time, at all events. He went at once and sat\\ndown on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him; we all watched\\nin patience.\\n\\n“We shall wait,” said Van Helsing, “just long enough to fix the best\\nspot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove\\nthe blood clot; for it is evident that the hæmorrhage is increasing.”\\n\\nThe minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had a\\nhorrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing’s face I gathered\\nthat he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreaded\\nthe words that Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think;\\nbut the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of men\\nwho have heard the death-watch. The poor man’s breathing came in\\nuncertain gasps. Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes\\nand speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he\\nwould relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sick\\nbeds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. I could almost\\nhear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my\\ntemples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally became\\nagonising. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from\\ntheir flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal\\ntorture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead\\nsome dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect\\nit.\\n\\nAt last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was\\nsinking fast; he might die at any moment. I looked up at the Professor\\nand caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he\\nspoke:--\\n\\n“There is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives; I have\\nbeen thinking so, as I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake!\\nWe shall operate just above the ear.”\\n\\nWithout another word he made the operation. For a few moments the\\nbreathing continued to be stertorous. Then there came a breath so\\nprolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest.\\nSuddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare.\\nThis was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a glad\\nsurprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. He moved\\nconvulsively, and as he did so, said:--\\n\\n“I’ll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. I\\nhave had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot\\nmove. What’s wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smarts\\ndreadfully.” He tried to turn his head; but even with the effort his\\neyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back. Then Van\\nHelsing said in a quiet grave tone:--\\n\\n“Tell us your dream, Mr. Renfield.” As he heard the voice his face\\nbrightened, through its mutilation, and he said:--\\n\\n“That is Dr. Van Helsing. How good it is of you to be here. Give me some\\nwater, my lips are dry; and I shall try to tell you. I dreamed”--he\\nstopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to Quincey--“The\\nbrandy--it is in my study--quick!” He flew and returned with a glass,\\nthe decanter of brandy and a carafe of water. We moistened the parched\\nlips, and the patient quickly revived. It seemed, however, that his poor\\ninjured brain had been working in the interval, for, when he was quite\\nconscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which I\\nshall never forget, and said:--\\n\\n“I must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality.”\\nThen his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the two\\nfigures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on:--\\n\\n“If I were not sure already, I would know from them.” For an instant his\\neyes closed--not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though he were\\nbringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened them he said,\\nhurriedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed:--\\n\\n“Quick, Doctor, quick. I am dying! I feel that I have but a few minutes;\\nand then I must go back to death--or worse! Wet my lips with brandy\\nagain. I have something that I must say before I die; or before my poor\\ncrushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! It was that night after you left\\nme, when I implored you to let me go away. I couldn’t speak then, for I\\nfelt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except in that way, as\\nI am now. I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left\\nme; it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me. My brain\\nseemed to become cool again, and I realised where I was. I heard the\\ndogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!” As he spoke, Van\\nHelsing’s eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and\\ngripped it hard. He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded slightly\\nand said: “Go on,” in a low voice. Renfield proceeded:--\\n\\n“He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before;\\nbut he was solid then--not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a\\nman’s when angry. He was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp white\\nteeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt\\nof trees, to where the dogs were barking. I wouldn’t ask him to come in\\nat first, though I knew he wanted to--just as he had wanted all along.\\nThen he began promising me things--not in words but by doing them.” He\\nwas interrupted by a word from the Professor:--\\n\\n“How?”\\n\\n“By making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when the\\nsun was shining. Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their\\nwings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their\\nbacks.” Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously:--\\n\\n“The _Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphinges_--what you call the\\n‘Death’s-head Moth’?” The patient went on without stopping.\\n\\n“Then he began to whisper: ‘Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands,\\nmillions of them, and every one a life; and dogs to eat them, and cats\\ntoo. All lives! all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merely\\nbuzzing flies!’ I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do.\\nThen the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house. He\\nbeckoned me to the window. I got up and looked out, and He raised his\\nhands, and seemed to call out without using any words. A dark mass\\nspread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; and\\nthen He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there\\nwere thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red--like His, only\\nsmaller. He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought he\\nseemed to be saying: ‘All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more\\nand greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship\\nme!’ And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close\\nover my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening\\nthe sash and saying to Him: ‘Come in, Lord and Master!’ The rats were\\nall gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was only\\nopen an inch wide--just as the Moon herself has often come in through\\nthe tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and\\nsplendour.”\\n\\nHis voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and\\nhe continued; but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in\\nthe interval for his story was further advanced. I was about to call him\\nback to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: “Let him go on. Do\\nnot interrupt him; he cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all\\nif once he lost the thread of his thought.” He proceeded:--\\n\\n“All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not\\neven a blow-fly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him.\\nWhen he slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even\\nknock, I got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white face looked\\nout of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he\\nowned the whole place, and I was no one. He didn’t even smell the same\\nas he went by me. I couldn’t hold him. I thought that, somehow, Mrs.\\nHarker had come into the room.”\\n\\nThe two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind\\nhim so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better.\\nThey were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered; his face,\\nhowever, grew grimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on without\\nnoticing:--\\n\\n“When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn’t the same;\\nit was like tea after the teapot had been watered.” Here we all moved,\\nbut no one said a word; he went on:--\\n\\n“I didn’t know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn’t look the\\nsame. I don’t care for the pale people; I like them with lots of blood\\nin them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. I didn’t think of it\\nat the time; but when she went away I began to think, and it made me mad\\nto know that He had been taking the life out of her.” I could feel that\\nthe rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still. “So when\\nHe came to-night I was ready for Him. I saw the mist stealing in, and I\\ngrabbed it tight. I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; and\\nas I knew I was a madman--at times anyhow--I resolved to use my power.\\nAy, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to struggle\\nwith me. I held tight; and I thought I was going to win, for I didn’t\\nmean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes. They burned\\ninto me, and my strength became like water. He slipped through it, and\\nwhen I tried to cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down. There\\nwas a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed\\nto steal away under the door.” His voice was becoming fainter and his\\nbreath more stertorous. Van Helsing stood up instinctively.\\n\\n“We know the worst now,” he said. “He is here, and we know his purpose.\\nIt may not be too late. Let us be armed--the same as we were the other\\nnight, but lose no time; there is not an instant to spare.” There was no\\nneed to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words--we shared them in\\ncommon. We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we\\nhad when we entered the Count’s house. The Professor had his ready, and\\nas we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said:--\\n\\n“They never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy business is\\nover. Be wise also, my friends. It is no common enemy that we deal with.\\nAlas! alas! that that dear Madam Mina should suffer!” He stopped; his\\nvoice was breaking, and I do not know if rage or terror predominated in\\nmy own heart.\\n\\nOutside the Harkers’ door we paused. Art and Quincey held back, and the\\nlatter said:--\\n\\n“Should we disturb her?”\\n\\n“We must,” said Van Helsing grimly. “If the door be locked, I shall\\nbreak it in.”\\n\\n“May it not frighten her terribly? It is unusual to break into a lady’s\\nroom!”\\n\\nVan Helsing said solemnly, “You are always right; but this is life and\\ndeath. All chambers are alike to the doctor; and even were they not they\\nare all as one to me to-night. Friend John, when I turn the handle, if\\nthe door does not open, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and you\\ntoo, my friends. Now!”\\n\\nHe turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield. We threw\\nourselves against it; with a crash it burst open, and we almost fell\\nheadlong into the room. The Professor did actually fall, and I saw\\nacross him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees. What I saw\\nappalled me. I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck,\\nand my heart seemed to stand still.\\n\\nThe moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room\\nwas light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan\\nHarker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor.\\nKneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad\\nfigure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black.\\nHis face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised\\nthe Count--in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. With his left\\nhand he held both Mrs. Harker’s hands, keeping them away with her arms\\nat full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck,\\nforcing her face down on his bosom. Her white nightdress was smeared\\nwith blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man’s bare breast which\\nwas shown by his torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible\\nresemblance to a child forcing a kitten’s nose into a saucer of milk to\\ncompel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his\\nface, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap\\ninto it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils\\nof the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the\\nwhite sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth,\\nchamped together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threw\\nhis victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned\\nand sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet,\\nand was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred\\nWafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside\\nthe tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back he cowered, as we,\\nlifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a\\ngreat black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up\\nunder Quincey’s match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as we\\nlooked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting\\nopen, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved\\nforward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with\\nit had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it\\nseems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For a\\nfew seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was\\nghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared\\nher lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of\\nblood; her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her\\npoor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the\\nCount’s terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail\\nwhich made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an\\nendless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently\\nover her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant\\ndespairingly, ran out of the room. Van Helsing whispered to me:--\\n\\n“Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce. We can\\ndo nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recovers\\nherself; I must wake him!” He dipped the end of a towel in cold water\\nand with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the while\\nholding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was\\nheart-breaking to hear. I raised the blind, and looked out of the\\nwindow. There was much moonshine; and as I looked I could see Quincey\\nMorris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great\\nyew-tree. It puzzled me to think why he was doing this; but at the\\ninstant I heard Harker’s quick exclamation as he woke to partial\\nconsciousness, and turned to the bed. On his face, as there might well\\nbe, was a look of wild amazement. He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and\\nthen full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he\\nstarted up. His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to\\nhim with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly,\\nhowever, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held\\nher hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.\\n\\n“In God’s name what does this mean?” Harker cried out. “Dr. Seward, Dr.\\nVan Helsing, what is it? What has happened? What is wrong? Mina, dear,\\nwhat is it? What does that blood mean? My God, my God! has it come to\\nthis!” and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly\\ntogether. “Good God help us! help her! oh, help her!” With a quick\\nmovement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,--all the\\nman in him awake at the need for instant exertion. “What has happened?\\nTell me all about it!” he cried without pausing. “Dr. Van Helsing, you\\nlove Mina, I know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone too\\nfar yet. Guard her while I look for _him_!” His wife, through her terror\\nand horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantly\\nforgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out:--\\n\\n“No! no! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I have suffered enough\\nto-night, God knows, without the dread of his harming you. You must stay\\nwith me. Stay with these friends who will watch over you!” Her\\nexpression became frantic as she spoke; and, he yielding to her, she\\npulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him fiercely.\\n\\nVan Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Professor held up his\\nlittle golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness:--\\n\\n“Do not fear, my dear. We are here; and whilst this is close to you no\\nfoul thing can approach. You are safe for to-night; and we must be calm\\nand take counsel together.” She shuddered and was silent, holding down\\nher head on her husband’s breast. When she raised it, his white\\nnight-robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and where\\nthe thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops. The instant she\\nsaw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst choking\\nsobs:--\\n\\n“Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more. Oh, that it\\nshould be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may have\\nmost cause to fear.” To this he spoke out resolutely:--\\n\\n“Nonsense, Mina. It is a shame to me to hear such a word. I would not\\nhear it of you; and I shall not hear it from you. May God judge me by my\\ndeserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour,\\nif by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!” He put out\\nhis arms and folded her to his breast; and for a while she lay there\\nsobbing. He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked\\ndamply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel. After a\\nwhile her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said to\\nme, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous\\npower to the utmost:--\\n\\n“And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well I know the broad\\nfact; tell me all that has been.” I told him exactly what had happened,\\nand he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitched\\nand his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had\\nheld his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth to\\nthe open wound in his breast. It interested me, even at that moment, to\\nsee, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over\\nthe bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled\\nhair. Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door.\\nThey entered in obedience to our summons. Van Helsing looked at me\\nquestioningly. I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of\\ntheir coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband\\nand wife from each other and from themselves; so on nodding acquiescence\\nto him he asked them what they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalming\\nanswered:--\\n\\n“I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms. I\\nlooked in the study but, though he had been there, he had gone. He had,\\nhowever----” He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on\\nthe bed. Van Helsing said gravely:--\\n\\n“Go on, friend Arthur. We want here no more concealments. Our hope now\\nis in knowing all. Tell freely!” So Art went on:--\\n\\n“He had been there, and though it could only have been for a few\\nseconds, he made rare hay of the place. All the manuscript had been\\nburned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes; the\\ncylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax\\nhad helped the flames.” Here I interrupted. “Thank God there is the\\nother copy in the safe!” His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he\\nwent on: “I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him. I looked\\ninto Renfield’s room; but there was no trace there except----!” Again he\\npaused. “Go on,” said Harker hoarsely; so he bowed his head and\\nmoistening his lips with his tongue, added: “except that the poor fellow\\nis dead.” Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of\\nus she said solemnly:--\\n\\n“God’s will be done!” I could not but feel that Art was keeping back\\nsomething; but, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing.\\nVan Helsing turned to Morris and asked:--\\n\\n“And you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell?”\\n\\n“A little,” he answered. “It may be much eventually, but at present I\\ncan’t say. I thought it well to know if possible where the Count would\\ngo when he left the house. I did not see him; but I saw a bat rise from\\nRenfield’s window, and flap westward. I expected to see him in some\\nshape go back to Carfax; but he evidently sought some other lair. He\\nwill not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and the\\ndawn is close. We must work to-morrow!”\\n\\nHe said the latter words through his shut teeth. For a space of perhaps\\na couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that I could\\nhear the sound of our hearts beating; then Van Helsing said, placing his\\nhand very tenderly on Mrs. Harker’s head:--\\n\\n“And now, Madam Mina--poor, dear, dear Madam Mina--tell us exactly what\\nhappened. God knows that I do not want that you be pained; but it is\\nneed that we know all. For now more than ever has all work to be done\\nquick and sharp, and in deadly earnest. The day is close to us that must\\nend all, if it may be so; and now is the chance that we may live and\\nlearn.”\\n\\nThe poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves\\nas she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and\\nlower still on his breast. Then she raised her head proudly, and held\\nout one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and\\nkissing it reverently, held it fast. The other hand was locked in that\\nof her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly.\\nAfter a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she\\nbegan:--\\n\\n“I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a\\nlong time it did not act. I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads\\nof horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind--all of them\\nconnected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble.”\\nHer husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said\\nlovingly: “Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help me\\nthrough the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it is to me\\nto tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I\\nneed your help. Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work\\nwith my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to\\nsleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no\\nmore. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when\\nnext I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that I\\nhad before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this; you will find\\nit in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vague\\nterror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence.\\nI turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it\\nseemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I\\ntried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I\\nlooked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside\\nthe bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist--or rather as if the mist\\nhad turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared--stood a\\ntall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of\\nthe others. The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light\\nfell in a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white\\nteeth showing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the\\nsunset on the windows of St. Mary’s Church at Whitby. I knew, too, the\\nred scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instant\\nmy heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was\\nparalysed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper,\\npointing as he spoke to Jonathan:--\\n\\n“‘Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out\\nbefore your very eyes.’ I was appalled and was too bewildered to do or\\nsay anything. With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulder\\nand, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did\\nso, ‘First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions. You may as well\\nbe quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have\\nappeased my thirst!’ I was bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did not\\nwant to hinder him. I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that\\nsuch is, when his touch is on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pity\\nme! He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!” Her husband groaned\\nagain. She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if\\nhe were the injured one, and went on:--\\n\\n“I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon. How long\\nthis horrible thing lasted I know not; but it seemed that a long time\\nmust have passed before he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. I\\nsaw it drip with the fresh blood!” The remembrance seemed for a while to\\noverpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her\\nhusband’s sustaining arm. With a great effort she recovered herself and\\nwent on:--\\n\\n“Then he spoke to me mockingly, ‘And so you, like the others, would play\\nyour brains against mine. You would help these men to hunt me and\\nfrustrate me in my designs! You know now, and they know in part already,\\nand will know in full before long, what it is to cross my path. They\\nshould have kept their energies for use closer to home. Whilst they\\nplayed wits against me--against me who commanded nations, and intrigued\\nfor them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they were\\nborn--I was countermining them. And you, their best beloved one, are now\\nto me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountiful\\nwine-press for a while; and shall be later on my companion and my\\nhelper. You shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shall\\nminister to your needs. But as yet you are to be punished for what you\\nhave done. You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my\\ncall. When my brain says “Come!” to you, you shall cross land or sea to\\ndo my bidding; and to that end this!’ With that he pulled open his\\nshirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast. When\\nthe blood began to spurt out, he took my hands in one of his, holding\\nthem tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to\\nthe wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some of the---- Oh\\nmy God! my God! what have I done? What have I done to deserve such a\\nfate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my\\ndays. God pity me! Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril;\\nand in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!” Then she began to rub her\\nlips as though to cleanse them from pollution.\\n\\nAs she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken,\\nand everything became more and more clear. Harker was still and quiet;\\nbut over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came a grey look\\nwhich deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the first\\nred streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly out\\nagainst the whitening hair.\\n\\nWe have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappy\\npair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action.\\n\\nOf this I am sure: the sun rises to-day on no more miserable house in\\nall the great round of its daily course.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII\\n\\nJONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL\\n\\n\\n_3 October._--As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary. It\\nis now six o’clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and\\ntake something to eat; for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreed\\nthat if we do not eat we cannot work our best. Our best will be, God\\nknows, required to-day. I must keep writing at every chance, for I dare\\nnot stop to think. All, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the end\\nthe little things may teach us most. The teaching, big or little, could\\nnot have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are to-day. However,\\nwe must trust and hope. Poor Mina told me just now, with the tears\\nrunning down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our\\nfaith is tested--that we must keep on trusting; and that God will aid us\\nup to the end. The end! oh my God! what end?... To work! To work!\\n\\nWhen Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor\\nRenfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. First, Dr. Seward\\ntold us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below\\nthey had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face was\\nall bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.\\n\\nDr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had\\nheard anything. He said that he had been sitting down--he confessed to\\nhalf dozing--when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfield\\nhad called out loudly several times, “God! God! God!” after that there\\nwas a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found him lying\\non the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him. Van Helsing\\nasked if he had heard “voices” or “a voice,” and he said he could not\\nsay; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as\\nthere was no one in the room it could have been only one. He could swear\\nto it, if required, that the word “God” was spoken by the patient. Dr.\\nSeward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go into\\nthe matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and it\\nwould never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it. As\\nit was, he thought that on the attendant’s evidence he could give a\\ncertificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed. In case the\\ncoroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarily\\nto the same result.\\n\\nWhen the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next\\nstep, the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in full\\nconfidence; that nothing of any sort--no matter how painful--should be\\nkept from her. She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful\\nto see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth of\\ndespair. “There must be no concealment,” she said, “Alas! we have had\\ntoo much already. And besides there is nothing in all the world that can\\ngive me more pain than I have already endured--than I suffer now!\\nWhatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!”\\nVan Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenly\\nbut quietly:--\\n\\n“But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but for\\nothers from yourself, after what has happened?” Her face grew set in its\\nlines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she\\nanswered:--\\n\\n“Ah no! for my mind is made up!”\\n\\n“To what?” he asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each in\\nour own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant. Her answer\\ncame with direct simplicity, as though she were simply stating a fact:--\\n\\n“Because if I find in myself--and I shall watch keenly for it--a sign of\\nharm to any that I love, I shall die!”\\n\\n“You would not kill yourself?” he asked, hoarsely.\\n\\n“I would; if there were no friend who loved me, who would save me such a\\npain, and so desperate an effort!” She looked at him meaningly as she\\nspoke. He was sitting down; but now he rose and came close to her and\\nput his hand on her head as he said solemnly:\\n\\n“My child, there is such an one if it were for your good. For myself I\\ncould hold it in my account with God to find such an euthanasia for you,\\neven at this moment if it were best. Nay, were it safe! But my\\nchild----” For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in his\\nthroat; he gulped it down and went on:--\\n\\n“There are here some who would stand between you and death. You must not\\ndie. You must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own. Until\\nthe other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must not\\ndie; for if he is still with the quick Un-Dead, your death would make\\nyou even as he is. No, you must live! You must struggle and strive to\\nlive, though death would seem a boon unspeakable. You must fight Death\\nhimself, though he come to you in pain or in joy; by the day, or the\\nnight; in safety or in peril! On your living soul I charge you that you\\ndo not die--nay, nor think of death--till this great evil be past.” The\\npoor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as I have seen a\\nquicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide. We were all\\nsilent; we could do nothing. At length she grew more calm and turning to\\nhim said, sweetly, but oh! so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand:--\\n\\n“I promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shall\\nstrive to do so; till, if it may be in His good time, this horror may\\nhave passed away from me.” She was so good and brave that we all felt\\nthat our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and we\\nbegan to discuss what we were to do. I told her that she was to have all\\nthe papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we\\nmight hereafter use; and was to keep the record as she had done before.\\nShe was pleased with the prospect of anything to do--if “pleased” could\\nbe used in connection with so grim an interest.\\n\\nAs usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was\\nprepared with an exact ordering of our work.\\n\\n“It is perhaps well,” he said, “that at our meeting after our visit to\\nCarfax we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that lay\\nthere. Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, and\\nwould doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an\\neffort with regard to the others; but now he does not know our\\nintentions. Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such a\\npower exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that he cannot use\\nthem as of old. We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as\\nto their disposition that, when we have examined the house in\\nPiccadilly, we may track the very last of them. To-day, then, is ours;\\nand in it rests our hope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning\\nguards us in its course. Until it sets to-night, that monster must\\nretain whatever form he now has. He is confined within the limitations\\nof his earthly envelope. He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear\\nthrough cracks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a doorway, he\\nmust open the door like a mortal. And so we have this day to hunt out\\nall his lairs and sterilise them. So we shall, if we have not yet catch\\nhim and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching\\nand the destroying shall be, in time, sure.” Here I started up for I\\ncould not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so\\npreciously laden with Mina’s life and happiness were flying from us,\\nsince whilst we talked action was impossible. But Van Helsing held up\\nhis hand warningly. “Nay, friend Jonathan,” he said, “in this, the\\nquickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say. We shall all\\nact and act with desperate quick, when the time has come. But think, in\\nall probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly.\\nThe Count may have many houses which he has bought. Of them he will have\\ndeeds of purchase, keys and other things. He will have paper that he\\nwrite on; he will have his book of cheques. There are many belongings\\nthat he must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet,\\nwhere he come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the\\nvery vast of the traffic there is none to notice. We shall go there and\\nsearch that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what our\\nfriend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt ‘stop the earths’ and so we\\nrun down our old fox--so? is it not?”\\n\\n“Then let us come at once,” I cried, “we are wasting the precious,\\nprecious time!” The Professor did not move, but simply said:--\\n\\n“And how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly?”\\n\\n“Any way!” I cried. “We shall break in if need be.”\\n\\n“And your police; where will they be, and what will they say?”\\n\\nI was staggered; but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good\\nreason for it. So I said, as quietly as I could:--\\n\\n“Don’t wait more than need be; you know, I am sure, what torture I am\\nin.”\\n\\n“Ah, my child, that I do; and indeed there is no wish of me to add to\\nyour anguish. But just think, what can we do, until all the world be at\\nmovement. Then will come our time. I have thought and thought, and it\\nseems to me that the simplest way is the best of all. Now we wish to get\\ninto the house, but we have no key; is it not so?” I nodded.\\n\\n“Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could\\nnot still get in; and think there was to you no conscience of the\\nhousebreaker, what would you do?”\\n\\n“I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick the\\nlock for me.”\\n\\n“And your police, they would interfere, would they not?”\\n\\n“Oh, no! not if they knew the man was properly employed.”\\n\\n“Then,” he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, “all that is in doubt is\\nthe conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as to\\nwhether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one. Your\\npolice must indeed be zealous men and clever--oh, so clever!--in reading\\nthe heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. No, no, my\\nfriend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this\\nyour London, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as such\\nthings are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done,\\nno one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine\\nhouse in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland\\nand lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back and\\ngot in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out\\nand in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. Then he\\nhave an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice;\\nand when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of\\nthat other man who own them. Then he go to a builder, and he sell him\\nthat house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away\\nwithin a certain time. And your police and other authority help him all\\nthey can. And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerland\\nhe find only an empty hole where his house had been. This was all done\\n_en règle_; and in our work we shall be _en règle_ too. We shall not go\\nso early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem\\nit strange; but we shall go after ten o’clock, when there are many\\nabout, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the\\nhouse.”\\n\\nI could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of Mina’s\\nface became relaxed a thought; there was hope in such good counsel. Van\\nHelsing went on:--\\n\\n“When once within that house we may find more clues; at any rate some of\\nus can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be\\nmore earth-boxes--at Bermondsey and Mile End.”\\n\\nLord Godalming stood up. “I can be of some use here,” he said. “I shall\\nwire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most\\nconvenient.”\\n\\n“Look here, old fellow,” said Morris, “it is a capital idea to have all\\nready in case we want to go horsebacking; but don’t you think that one\\nof your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway of\\nWalworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our purposes?\\nIt seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east; and\\neven leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to.”\\n\\n“Friend Quincey is right!” said the Professor. “His head is what you\\ncall in plane with the horizon. It is a difficult thing that we go to\\ndo, and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may.”\\n\\nMina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to see\\nthat the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the\\nterrible experience of the night. She was very, very pale--almost\\nghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in\\nsomewhat of prominence. I did not mention this last, lest it should give\\nher needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of\\nwhat had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood. As\\nyet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper; but the time as yet\\nwas short, and there was time for fear.\\n\\nWhen we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the\\ndisposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt. It was\\nfinally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy the\\nCount’s lair close at hand. In case he should find it out too soon, we\\nshould thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction; and his\\npresence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give us\\nsome new clue.\\n\\nAs to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that,\\nafter our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly;\\nthat the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming\\nand Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them.\\nIt was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the Count\\nmight appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might be\\nable to cope with him then and there. At any rate, we might be able to\\nfollow him in force. To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far as\\nmy going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protect\\nMina, I thought that my mind was made up on the subject; but Mina would\\nnot listen to my objection. She said that there might be some law matter\\nin which I could be useful; that amongst the Count’s papers might be\\nsome clue which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania;\\nand that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to\\ncope with the Count’s extraordinary power. I had to give in, for Mina’s\\nresolution was fixed; she said that it was the last hope for _her_ that\\nwe should all work together. “As for me,” she said, “I have no fear.\\nThings have been as bad as they can be; and whatever may happen must\\nhave in it some element of hope or comfort. Go, my husband! God can, if\\nHe wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present.” So I\\nstarted up crying out: “Then in God’s name let us come at once, for we\\nare losing time. The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than we\\nthink.”\\n\\n“Not so!” said Van Helsing, holding up his hand.\\n\\n“But why?” I asked.\\n\\n“Do you forget,” he said, with actually a smile, “that last night he\\nbanqueted heavily, and will sleep late?”\\n\\nDid I forget! shall I ever--can I ever! Can any of us ever forget that\\nterrible scene! Mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance; but\\nthe pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, and\\nshuddered whilst she moaned. Van Helsing had not intended to recall her\\nfrightful experience. He had simply lost sight of her and her part in\\nthe affair in his intellectual effort. When it struck him what he said,\\nhe was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her. “Oh,\\nMadam Mina,” he said, “dear, dear Madam Mina, alas! that I of all who so\\nreverence you should have said anything so forgetful. These stupid old\\nlips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so; but you will\\nforget it, will you not?” He bent low beside her as he spoke; she took\\nhis hand, and looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely:--\\n\\n“No, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember; and with it I\\nhave so much in memory of you that is sweet, that I take it all\\ntogether. Now, you must all be going soon. Breakfast is ready, and we\\nmust all eat that we may be strong.”\\n\\nBreakfast was a strange meal to us all. We tried to be cheerful and\\nencourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful of\\nus. When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said:--\\n\\n“Now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise. Are we\\nall armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy’s\\nlair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?” We all assured\\nhim. “Then it is well. Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case _quite_ safe\\nhere until the sunset; and before then we shall return--if---- We shall\\nreturn! But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack. I\\nhave myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing\\nof things of which we know, so that He may not enter. Now let me guard\\nyourself. On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in the\\nname of the Father, the Son, and----”\\n\\nThere was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear. As he\\nhad placed the Wafer on Mina’s forehead, it had seared it--had burned\\ninto the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal. My poor\\ndarling’s brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as\\nher nerves received the pain of it; and the two so overwhelmed her that\\nher overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream. But the\\nwords to her thought came quickly; the echo of the scream had not ceased\\nto ring on the air when there came the reaction, and she sank on her\\nknees on the floor in an agony of abasement. Pulling her beautiful hair\\nover her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out:--\\n\\n“Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh! I must\\nbear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgment Day.” They\\nall paused. I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless\\ngrief, and putting my arms around held her tight. For a few minutes our\\nsorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away\\ntheir eyes that ran tears silently. Then Van Helsing turned and said\\ngravely; so gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some\\nway inspired, and was stating things outside himself:--\\n\\n“It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit,\\nas He most surely shall, on the Judgment Day, to redress all wrongs of\\nthe earth and of His children that He has placed thereon. And oh, Madam\\nMina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that\\nred scar, the sign of God’s knowledge of what has been, shall pass away,\\nand leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. For so surely as\\nwe live, that scar shall pass away when God sees right to lift the\\nburden that is hard upon us. Till then we bear our Cross, as His Son did\\nin obedience to His Will. It may be that we are chosen instruments of\\nHis good pleasure, and that we ascend to His bidding as that other\\nthrough stripes and shame; through tears and blood; through doubts and\\nfears, and all that makes the difference between God and man.”\\n\\nThere was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for resignation.\\nMina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old\\nman’s hands and bent over and kissed it. Then without a word we all\\nknelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each\\nother. We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the\\nhead of her whom, each in his own way, we loved; and we prayed for help\\nand guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.\\n\\nIt was then time to start. So I said farewell to Mina, a parting which\\nneither of us shall forget to our dying day; and we set out.\\n\\nTo one thing I have made up my mind: if we find out that Mina must be a\\nvampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible\\nland alone. I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant\\nmany; just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so\\nthe holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.\\n\\nWe entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on\\nthe first occasion. It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic\\nsurroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such\\nfear as already we knew. Had not our minds been made up, and had there\\nnot been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceeded\\nwith our task. We found no papers, or any sign of use in the house; and\\nin the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last.\\nDr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them:--\\n\\n“And now, my friends, we have a duty here to do. We must sterilise this\\nearth, so sacred of holy memories, that he has brought from a far\\ndistant land for such fell use. He has chosen this earth because it has\\nbeen holy. Thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it more\\nholy still. It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to\\nGod.” As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, and\\nvery soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open. The earth smelled\\nmusty and close; but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention\\nwas concentrated on the Professor. Taking from his box a piece of the\\nSacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting down\\nthe lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.\\n\\nOne by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and left\\nthem as we had found them to all appearance; but in each was a portion\\nof the Host.\\n\\nWhen we closed the door behind us, the Professor said solemnly:--\\n\\n“So much is already done. If it may be that with all the others we can\\nbe so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine on Madam\\nMina’s forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!”\\n\\nAs we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our\\ntrain we could see the front of the asylum. I looked eagerly, and in the\\nwindow of my own room saw Mina. I waved my hand to her, and nodded to\\ntell that our work there was successfully accomplished. She nodded in\\nreply to show that she understood. The last I saw, she was waving her\\nhand in farewell. It was with a heavy heart that we sought the station\\nand just caught the train, which was steaming in as we reached the\\nplatform.\\n\\nI have written this in the train.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Piccadilly, 12:30 o’clock._--Just before we reached Fenchurch Street\\nLord Godalming said to me:--\\n\\n“Quincey and I will find a locksmith. You had better not come with us in\\ncase there should be any difficulty; for under the circumstances it\\nwouldn’t seem so bad for us to break into an empty house. But you are a\\nsolicitor and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that you\\nshould have known better.” I demurred as to my not sharing any danger\\neven of odium, but he went on: “Besides, it will attract less attention\\nif there are not too many of us. My title will make it all right with\\nthe locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along. You had\\nbetter go with Jack and the Professor and stay in the Green Park,\\nsomewhere in sight of the house; and when you see the door opened and\\nthe smith has gone away, do you all come across. We shall be on the\\nlookout for you, and shall let you in.”\\n\\n“The advice is good!” said Van Helsing, so we said no more. Godalming\\nand Morris hurried off in a cab, we following in another. At the corner\\nof Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the Green\\nPark. My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope was\\ncentred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst\\nits more lively and spruce-looking neighbours. We sat down on a bench\\nwithin good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little\\nattention as possible. The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we\\nwaited for the coming of the others.\\n\\nAt length we saw a four-wheeler drive up. Out of it, in leisurely\\nfashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris; and down from the box descended\\na thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools. Morris paid\\nthe cabman, who touched his hat and drove away. Together the two\\nascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done.\\nThe workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes\\nof the rail, saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered\\nalong. The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down\\nplaced his bag beside him. After searching through it, he took out a\\nselection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderly\\nfashion. Then he stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and\\nturning to his employers, made some remark. Lord Godalming smiled, and\\nthe man lifted a good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he\\nbegan to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. After fumbling\\nabout for a bit he tried a second, and then a third. All at once the\\ndoor opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two others\\nentered the hall. We sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously, but Van\\nHelsing’s went cold altogether. We waited patiently as we saw the\\nworkman come out and bring in his bag. Then he held the door partly\\nopen, steadying it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock.\\nThis he finally handed to Lord Godalming, who took out his purse and\\ngave him something. The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his\\ncoat and departed; not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole\\ntransaction.\\n\\nWhen the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked at\\nthe door. It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, beside whom stood\\nLord Godalming lighting a cigar.\\n\\n“The place smells so vilely,” said the latter as we came in. It did\\nindeed smell vilely--like the old chapel at Carfax--and with our\\nprevious experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using the\\nplace pretty freely. We moved to explore the house, all keeping together\\nin case of attack; for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal\\nwith, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be in the\\nhouse. In the dining-room, which lay at the back of the hall, we found\\neight boxes of earth. Eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought!\\nOur work was not over, and would never be until we should have found the\\nmissing box. First we opened the shutters of the window which looked out\\nacross a narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face of a stable,\\npointed to look like the front of a miniature house. There were no\\nwindows in it, so we were not afraid of being over-looked. We did not\\nlose any time in examining the chests. With the tools which we had\\nbrought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had\\ntreated those others in the old chapel. It was evident to us that the\\nCount was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for\\nany of his effects.\\n\\nAfter a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic,\\nwe came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any effects\\nwhich might belong to the Count; and so we proceeded to minutely examine\\nthem. They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-room\\ntable. There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle;\\ndeeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey;\\nnote-paper, envelopes, and pens and ink. All were covered up in thin\\nwrapping paper to keep them from the dust. There were also a clothes\\nbrush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin--the latter containing\\ndirty water which was reddened as if with blood. Last of all was a\\nlittle heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to\\nthe other houses. When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming\\nand Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the\\nhouses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a great\\nbunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places. The rest of us\\nare, with what patience we can, waiting their return--or the coming of\\nthe Count.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII\\n\\nDR. SEWARD’S DIARY\\n\\n\\n_3 October._--The time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting for\\nthe coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris. The Professor tried to keep\\nour minds active by using them all the time. I could see his beneficent\\npurpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker.\\nThe poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see.\\nLast night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthful\\nface, full of energy, and with dark brown hair. To-day he is a drawn,\\nhaggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning\\neyes and grief-written lines of his face. His energy is still intact; in\\nfact, he is like a living flame. This may yet be his salvation, for, if\\nall go well, it will tide him over the despairing period; he will then,\\nin a kind of way, wake again to the realities of life. Poor fellow, I\\nthought my own trouble was bad enough, but his----! The Professor knows\\nthis well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active. What he\\nhas been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest. So\\nwell as I can remember, here it is:--\\n\\n“I have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, all\\nthe papers relating to this monster; and the more I have studied, the\\ngreater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out. All through there\\nare signs of his advance; not only of his power, but of his knowledge of\\nit. As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminus of Buda-Pesth,\\nhe was in life a most wonderful man. Soldier, statesman, and\\nalchemist--which latter was the highest development of the\\nscience-knowledge of his time. He had a mighty brain, a learning beyond\\ncompare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse. He dared even to\\nattend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time\\nthat he did not essay. Well, in him the brain powers survived the\\nphysical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete.\\nIn some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child; but he is\\ngrowing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of\\nman’s stature. He is experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had not\\nbeen that we have crossed his path he would be yet--he may be yet if we\\nfail--the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must\\nlead through Death, not Life.”\\n\\nHarker groaned and said, “And this is all arrayed against my darling!\\nBut how is he experimenting? The knowledge may help us to defeat him!”\\n\\n“He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but\\nsurely; that big child-brain of his is working. Well for us, it is, as\\nyet, a child-brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain\\nthings he would long ago have been beyond our power. However, he means\\nto succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait\\nand to go slow. _Festina lente_ may well be his motto.”\\n\\n“I fail to understand,” said Harker wearily. “Oh, do be more plain to\\nme! Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain.”\\n\\nThe Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke:--\\n\\n“Ah, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see how, of late, this\\nmonster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally. How he has been\\nmaking use of the zoöphagous patient to effect his entry into friend\\nJohn’s home; for your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come when\\nand how he will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by\\nan inmate. But these are not his most important experiments. Do we not\\nsee how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others. He\\nknew not then but that must be so. But all the time that so great\\nchild-brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether he\\nmight not himself move the box. So he began to help; and then, when he\\nfound that this be all-right, he try to move them all alone. And so he\\nprogress, and he scatter these graves of him; and none but he know where\\nthey are hidden. He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. So\\nthat he only use them in the night, or at such time as he can change his\\nform, they do him equal well; and none may know these are his\\nhiding-place! But, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to him\\njust too late! Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him;\\nand before the sunset this shall be so. Then he have no place where he\\ncan move and hide. I delayed this morning that so we might be sure. Is\\nthere not more at stake for us than for him? Then why we not be even\\nmore careful than him? By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be\\nwell, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us. To-day is our\\nday, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance. See! there are\\nfive of us when those absent ones return.”\\n\\nWhilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door, the\\ndouble postman’s knock of the telegraph boy. We all moved out to the\\nhall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us to\\nkeep silence, stepped to the door and opened it. The boy handed in a\\ndespatch. The Professor closed the door again, and, after looking at the\\ndirection, opened it and read aloud.\\n\\n“Look out for D. He has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax hurriedly and\\nhastened towards the South. He seems to be going the round and may want\\nto see you: Mina.”\\n\\nThere was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker’s voice:--\\n\\n“Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!” Van Helsing turned to him\\nquickly and said:--\\n\\n“God will act in His own way and time. Do not fear, and do not rejoice\\nas yet; for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoings.”\\n\\n“I care for nothing now,” he answered hotly, “except to wipe out this\\nbrute from the face of creation. I would sell my soul to do it!”\\n\\n“Oh, hush, hush, my child!” said Van Helsing. “God does not purchase\\nsouls in this wise; and the Devil, though he may purchase, does not keep\\nfaith. But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and your\\ndevotion to that dear Madam Mina. Think you, how her pain would be\\ndoubled, did she but hear your wild words. Do not fear any of us, we are\\nall devoted to this cause, and to-day shall see the end. The time is\\ncoming for action; to-day this Vampire is limit to the powers of man,\\nand till sunset he may not change. It will take him time to arrive\\nhere--see, it is twenty minutes past one--and there are yet some times\\nbefore he can hither come, be he never so quick. What we must hope for\\nis that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first.”\\n\\nAbout half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker’s telegram, there\\ncame a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door. It was just an ordinary\\nknock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made\\nthe Professor’s heart and mine beat loudly. We looked at each other, and\\ntogether moved out into the hall; we each held ready to use our various\\narmaments--the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right. Van\\nHelsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stood\\nback, having both hands ready for action. The gladness of our hearts\\nmust have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, we\\nsaw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris. They came quickly in and closed\\nthe door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the\\nhall:--\\n\\n“It is all right. We found both places; six boxes in each and we\\ndestroyed them all!”\\n\\n“Destroyed?” asked the Professor.\\n\\n“For him!” We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said:--\\n\\n“There’s nothing to do but to wait here. If, however, he doesn’t turn up\\nby five o’clock, we must start off; for it won’t do to leave Mrs. Harker\\nalone after sunset.”\\n\\n“He will be here before long now,” said Van Helsing, who had been\\nconsulting his pocket-book. “_Nota bene_, in Madam’s telegram he went\\nsouth from Carfax, that means he went to cross the river, and he could\\nonly do so at slack of tide, which should be something before one\\no’clock. That he went south has a meaning for us. He is as yet only\\nsuspicious; and he went from Carfax first to the place where he would\\nsuspect interference least. You must have been at Bermondsey only a\\nshort time before him. That he is not here already shows that he went to\\nMile End next. This took him some time; for he would then have to be\\ncarried over the river in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shall not\\nhave long to wait now. We should have ready some plan of attack, so that\\nwe may throw away no chance. Hush, there is no time now. Have all your\\narms! Be ready!” He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all could\\nhear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door.\\n\\nI could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a\\ndominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties and\\nadventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always\\nbeen the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been\\naccustomed to obey him implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be\\nrenewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, he at once\\nlaid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a\\ngesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker, and I were\\njust behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could\\nguard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door.\\nGodalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to\\nmove in front of the window. We waited in a suspense that made the\\nseconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came along\\nthe hall; the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise--at least\\nhe feared it.\\n\\nSuddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room, winning a way past\\nus before any of us could raise a hand to stay him. There was something\\nso panther-like in the movement--something so unhuman, that it seemed\\nto sober us all from the shock of his coming. The first to act was\\nHarker, who, with a quick movement, threw himself before the door\\nleading into the room in the front of the house. As the Count saw us, a\\nhorrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eye-teeth long\\nand pointed; but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of\\nlion-like disdain. His expression again changed as, with a single\\nimpulse, we all advanced upon him. It was a pity that we had not some\\nbetter organised plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered what\\nwe were to do. I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would\\navail us anything. Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he had\\nready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him. The\\nblow was a powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the Count’s\\nleap back saved him. A second less and the trenchant blade had shorne\\nthrough his heart. As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat,\\nmaking a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of gold\\nfell out. The expression of the Count’s face was so hellish, that for a\\nmoment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knife\\naloft again for another stroke. Instinctively I moved forward with a\\nprotective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. I\\nfelt a mighty power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that I\\nsaw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously\\nby each one of us. It would be impossible to describe the expression of\\nhate and baffled malignity--of anger and hellish rage--which came over\\nthe Count’s face. His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast\\nof his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the\\npallid skin like a palpitating wound. The next instant, with a sinuous\\ndive he swept under Harker’s arm, ere his blow could fall, and, grasping\\na handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw\\nhimself at the window. Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass,\\nhe tumbled into the flagged area below. Through the sound of the\\nshivering glass I could hear the “ting” of the gold, as some of the\\nsovereigns fell on the flagging.\\n\\nWe ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground. He, rushing up\\nthe steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door.\\nThere he turned and spoke to us:--\\n\\n“You think to baffle me, you--with your pale faces all in a row, like\\nsheep in a butcher’s. You shall be sorry yet, each one of you! You think\\nyou have left me without a place to rest; but I have more. My revenge is\\njust begun! I spread it over centuries, and time is on my side. Your\\ngirls that you all love are mine already; and through them you and\\nothers shall yet be mine--my creatures, to do my bidding and to be my\\njackals when I want to feed. Bah!” With a contemptuous sneer, he passed\\nquickly through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he\\nfastened it behind him. A door beyond opened and shut. The first of us\\nto speak was the Professor, as, realising the difficulty of following\\nhim through the stable, we moved toward the hall.\\n\\n“We have learnt something--much! Notwithstanding his brave words, he\\nfears us; he fear time, he fear want! For if not, why he hurry so? His\\nvery tone betray him, or my ears deceive. Why take that money? You\\nfollow quick. You are hunters of wild beast, and understand it so. For\\nme, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that he\\nreturn.” As he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket; took\\nthe title-deeds in the bundle as Harker had left them, and swept the\\nremaining things into the open fireplace, where he set fire to them with\\na match.\\n\\nGodalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker had\\nlowered himself from the window to follow the Count. He had, however,\\nbolted the stable door; and by the time they had forced it open there\\nwas no sign of him. Van Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the back\\nof the house; but the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart.\\n\\nIt was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off. We had to\\nrecognise that our game was up; with heavy hearts we agreed with the\\nProfessor when he said:--\\n\\n“Let us go back to Madam Mina--poor, poor dear Madam Mina. All we can do\\njust now is done; and we can there, at least, protect her. But we need\\nnot despair. There is but one more earth-box, and we must try to find\\nit; when that is done all may yet be well.” I could see that he spoke as\\nbravely as he could to comfort Harker. The poor fellow was quite broken\\ndown; now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress--he\\nwas thinking of his wife.\\n\\nWith sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs. Harker\\nwaiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her\\nbravery and unselfishness. When she saw our faces, her own became as\\npale as death: for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were\\nin secret prayer; and then she said cheerfully:--\\n\\n“I can never thank you all enough. Oh, my poor darling!” As she spoke,\\nshe took her husband’s grey head in her hands and kissed it--“Lay your\\npoor head here and rest it. All will yet be well, dear! God will protect\\nus if He so will it in His good intent.” The poor fellow groaned. There\\nwas no place for words in his sublime misery.\\n\\nWe had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered us\\nall up somewhat. It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry\\npeople--for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast--or the sense\\nof companionship may have helped us; but anyhow we were all less\\nmiserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope. True to\\nour promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything which had passed; and\\nalthough she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to\\nthreaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was\\nmanifested, she listened bravely and with calmness. When we came to the\\npart where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clung to\\nher husband’s arm, and held it tight as though her clinging could\\nprotect him from any harm that might come. She said nothing, however,\\ntill the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right up\\nto the present time. Then without letting go her husband’s hand she\\nstood up amongst us and spoke. Oh, that I could give any idea of the\\nscene; of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty\\nof her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead, of which\\nshe was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our\\nteeth--remembering whence and how it came; her loving kindness against\\nour grim hate; her tender faith against all our fears and doubting; and\\nwe, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness and\\npurity and faith, was outcast from God.\\n\\n“Jonathan,” she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips it was\\nso full of love and tenderness, “Jonathan dear, and you all my true,\\ntrue friends, I want you to bear something in mind through all this\\ndreadful time. I know that you must fight--that you must destroy even as\\nyou destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live hereafter;\\nbut it is not a work of hate. That poor soul who has wrought all this\\nmisery is the saddest case of all. Just think what will be his joy when\\nhe, too, is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have\\nspiritual immortality. You must be pitiful to him, too, though it may\\nnot hold your hands from his destruction.”\\n\\nAs she spoke I could see her husband’s face darken and draw together, as\\nthough the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core.\\nInstinctively the clasp on his wife’s hand grew closer, till his\\nknuckles looked white. She did not flinch from the pain which I knew she\\nmust have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing\\nthan ever. As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost tearing\\nhis hand from hers as he spoke:--\\n\\n“May God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that\\nearthly life of him which we are aiming at. If beyond it I could send\\nhis soul for ever and ever to burning hell I would do it!”\\n\\n“Oh, hush! oh, hush! in the name of the good God. Don’t say such things,\\nJonathan, my husband; or you will crush me with fear and horror. Just\\nthink, my dear--I have been thinking all this long, long day of it--that\\n... perhaps ... some day ... I, too, may need such pity; and that some\\nother like you--and with equal cause for anger--may deny it to me! Oh,\\nmy husband! my husband, indeed I would have spared you such a thought\\nhad there been another way; but I pray that God may not have treasured\\nyour wild words, except as the heart-broken wail of a very loving and\\nsorely stricken man. Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in evidence\\nof what he has suffered, who all his life has done no wrong, and on whom\\nso many sorrows have come.”\\n\\nWe men were all in tears now. There was no resisting them, and we wept\\nopenly. She wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed.\\nHer husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and putting his arms\\nround her, hid his face in the folds of her dress. Van Helsing beckoned\\nto us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two loving hearts alone\\nwith their God.\\n\\nBefore they retired the Professor fixed up the room against any coming\\nof the Vampire, and assured Mrs. Harker that she might rest in peace.\\nShe tried to school herself to the belief, and, manifestly for her\\nhusband’s sake, tried to seem content. It was a brave struggle; and was,\\nI think and believe, not without its reward. Van Helsing had placed at\\nhand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency.\\nWhen they had retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I arranged that we should\\nsit up, dividing the night between us, and watch over the safety of the\\npoor stricken lady. The first watch falls to Quincey, so the rest of us\\nshall be off to bed as soon as we can. Godalming has already turned in,\\nfor his is the second watch. Now that my work is done I, too, shall go\\nto bed.\\n\\n\\n_Jonathan Harker’s Journal._\\n\\n_3-4 October, close to midnight._--I thought yesterday would never end.\\nThere was over me a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind belief\\nthat to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change must\\nnow be for the better. Before we parted, we discussed what our next step\\nwas to be, but we could arrive at no result. All we knew was that one\\nearth-box remained, and that the Count alone knew where it was. If he\\nchooses to lie hidden, he may baffle us for years; and in the\\nmeantime!--the thought is too horrible, I dare not think of it even now.\\nThis I know: that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection, that\\none is my poor wronged darling. I love her a thousand times more for her\\nsweet pity of last night, a pity that made my own hate of the monster\\nseem despicable. Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorer\\nby the loss of such a creature. This is hope to me. We are all drifting\\nreefwards now, and faith is our only anchor. Thank God! Mina is\\nsleeping, and sleeping without dreams. I fear what her dreams might be\\nlike, with such terrible memories to ground them in. She has not been so\\ncalm, within my seeing, since the sunset. Then, for a while, there came\\nover her face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of March.\\nI thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her\\nface, but somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning. I am not sleepy\\nmyself, though I am weary--weary to death. However, I must try to sleep;\\nfor there is to-morrow to think of, and there is no rest for me\\nuntil....\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later._--I must have fallen asleep, for I was awaked by Mina, who was\\nsitting up in bed, with a startled look on her face. I could see easily,\\nfor we did not leave the room in darkness; she had placed a warning hand\\nover my mouth, and now she whispered in my ear:--\\n\\n“Hush! there is someone in the corridor!” I got up softly, and crossing\\nthe room, gently opened the door.\\n\\nJust outside, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris, wide awake. He\\nraised a warning hand for silence as he whispered to me:--\\n\\n“Hush! go back to bed; it is all right. One of us will be here all\\nnight. We don’t mean to take any chances!”\\n\\nHis look and gesture forbade discussion, so I came back and told Mina.\\nShe sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor, pale\\nface as she put her arms round me and said softly:--\\n\\n“Oh, thank God for good brave men!” With a sigh she sank back again to\\nsleep. I write this now as I am not sleepy, though I must try again.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_4 October, morning._--Once again during the night I was wakened by\\nMina. This time we had all had a good sleep, for the grey of the coming\\ndawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas flame was\\nlike a speck rather than a disc of light. She said to me hurriedly:--\\n\\n“Go, call the Professor. I want to see him at once.”\\n\\n“Why?” I asked.\\n\\n“I have an idea. I suppose it must have come in the night, and matured\\nwithout my knowing it. He must hypnotise me before the dawn, and then I\\nshall be able to speak. Go quick, dearest; the time is getting close.” I\\nwent to the door. Dr. Seward was resting on the mattress, and, seeing\\nme, he sprang to his feet.\\n\\n“Is anything wrong?” he asked, in alarm.\\n\\n“No,” I replied; “but Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing at once.”\\n\\n“I will go,” he said, and hurried into the Professor’s room.\\n\\nIn two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in his\\ndressing-gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were with Dr. Seward at\\nthe door asking questions. When the Professor saw Mina smile--a\\npositive smile ousted the anxiety of his face; he rubbed his hands as he\\nsaid:--\\n\\n“Oh, my dear Madam Mina, this is indeed a change. See! friend Jonathan,\\nwe have got our dear Madam Mina, as of old, back to us to-day!” Then\\nturning to her, he said, cheerfully: “And what am I do for you? For at\\nthis hour you do not want me for nothings.”\\n\\n“I want you to hypnotise me!” she said. “Do it before the dawn, for I\\nfeel that then I can speak, and speak freely. Be quick, for the time is\\nshort!” Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed.\\n\\nLooking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of her,\\nfrom over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn. Mina\\ngazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beat\\nlike a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis was at hand. Gradually\\nher eyes closed, and she sat, stock still; only by the gentle heaving of\\nher bosom could one know that she was alive. The Professor made a few\\nmore passes and then stopped, and I could see that his forehead was\\ncovered with great beads of perspiration. Mina opened her eyes; but she\\ndid not seem the same woman. There was a far-away look in her eyes, and\\nher voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me. Raising his hand to\\nimpose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the others in.\\nThey came on tip-toe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the\\nfoot of the bed, looking on. Mina appeared not to see them. The\\nstillness was broken by Van Helsing’s voice speaking in a low level tone\\nwhich would not break the current of her thoughts:--\\n\\n“Where are you?” The answer came in a neutral way:--\\n\\n“I do not know. Sleep has no place it can call its own.” For several\\nminutes there was silence. Mina sat rigid, and the Professor stood\\nstaring at her fixedly; the rest of us hardly dared to breathe. The room\\nwas growing lighter; without taking his eyes from Mina’s face, Dr. Van\\nHelsing motioned me to pull up the blind. I did so, and the day seemed\\njust upon us. A red streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuse\\nitself through the room. On the instant the Professor spoke again:--\\n\\n“Where are you now?” The answer came dreamily, but with intention; it\\nwere as though she were interpreting something. I have heard her use the\\nsame tone when reading her shorthand notes.\\n\\n“I do not know. It is all strange to me!”\\n\\n“What do you see?”\\n\\n“I can see nothing; it is all dark.”\\n\\n“What do you hear?” I could detect the strain in the Professor’s patient\\nvoice.\\n\\n“The lapping of water. It is gurgling by, and little waves leap. I can\\nhear them on the outside.”\\n\\n“Then you are on a ship?” We all looked at each other, trying to glean\\nsomething each from the other. We were afraid to think. The answer came\\nquick:--\\n\\n“Oh, yes!”\\n\\n“What else do you hear?”\\n\\n“The sound of men stamping overhead as they run about. There is the\\ncreaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan\\nfalls into the rachet.”\\n\\n“What are you doing?”\\n\\n“I am still--oh, so still. It is like death!” The voice faded away into\\na deep breath as of one sleeping, and the open eyes closed again.\\n\\nBy this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of\\nday. Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina’s shoulders, and laid her\\nhead down softly on her pillow. She lay like a sleeping child for a few\\nmoments, and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see\\nus all around her. “Have I been talking in my sleep?” was all she said.\\nShe seemed, however, to know the situation without telling, though she\\nwas eager to know what she had told. The Professor repeated the\\nconversation, and she said:--\\n\\n“Then there is not a moment to lose: it may not be yet too late!” Mr.\\nMorris and Lord Godalming started for the door but the Professor’s calm\\nvoice called them back:--\\n\\n“Stay, my friends. That ship, wherever it was, was weighing anchor\\nwhilst she spoke. There are many ships weighing anchor at the moment in\\nyour so great Port of London. Which of them is it that you seek? God be\\nthanked that we have once again a clue, though whither it may lead us we\\nknow not. We have been blind somewhat; blind after the manner of men,\\nsince when we can look back we see what we might have seen looking\\nforward if we had been able to see what we might have seen! Alas, but\\nthat sentence is a puddle; is it not? We can know now what was in the\\nCount’s mind, when he seize that money, though Jonathan’s so fierce\\nknife put him in the danger that even he dread. He meant escape. Hear\\nme, ESCAPE! He saw that with but one earth-box left, and a pack of men\\nfollowing like dogs after a fox, this London was no place for him. He\\nhave take his last earth-box on board a ship, and he leave the land. He\\nthink to escape, but no! we follow him. Tally Ho! as friend Arthur would\\nsay when he put on his red frock! Our old fox is wily; oh! so wily, and\\nwe must follow with wile. I, too, am wily and I think his mind in a\\nlittle while. In meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are waters\\nbetween us which he do not want to pass, and which he could not if he\\nwould--unless the ship were to touch the land, and then only at full or\\nslack tide. See, and the sun is just rose, and all day to sunset is to\\nus. Let us take bath, and dress, and have breakfast which we all need,\\nand which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land with\\nus.” Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked:--\\n\\n“But why need we seek him further, when he is gone away from us?” He\\ntook her hand and patted it as he replied:--\\n\\n“Ask me nothings as yet. When we have breakfast, then I answer all\\nquestions.” He would say no more, and we separated to dress.\\n\\nAfter breakfast Mina repeated her question. He looked at her gravely for\\na minute and then said sorrowfully:--\\n\\n“Because my dear, dear Madam Mina, now more than ever must we find him\\neven if we have to follow him to the jaws of Hell!” She grew paler as\\nshe asked faintly:--\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because,” he answered solemnly, “he can live for centuries, and you are\\nbut mortal woman. Time is now to be dreaded--since once he put that mark\\nupon your throat.”\\n\\nI was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in a faint.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV\\n\\nDR. SEWARD’S PHONOGRAPH DIARY, SPOKEN BY VAN HELSING\\n\\n\\nThis to Jonathan Harker.\\n\\nYou are to stay with your dear Madam Mina. We shall go to make our\\nsearch--if I can call it so, for it is not search but knowing, and we\\nseek confirmation only. But do you stay and take care of her to-day.\\nThis is your best and most holiest office. This day nothing can find him\\nhere. Let me tell you that so you will know what we four know already,\\nfor I have tell them. He, our enemy, have gone away; he have gone back\\nto his Castle in Transylvania. I know it so well, as if a great hand of\\nfire wrote it on the wall. He have prepare for this in some way, and\\nthat last earth-box was ready to ship somewheres. For this he took the\\nmoney; for this he hurry at the last, lest we catch him before the sun\\ngo down. It was his last hope, save that he might hide in the tomb that\\nhe think poor Miss Lucy, being as he thought like him, keep open to him.\\nBut there was not of time. When that fail he make straight for his last\\nresource--his last earth-work I might say did I wish _double entente_.\\nHe is clever, oh, so clever! he know that his game here was finish; and\\nso he decide he go back home. He find ship going by the route he came,\\nand he go in it. We go off now to find what ship, and whither bound;\\nwhen we have discover that, we come back and tell you all. Then we will\\ncomfort you and poor dear Madam Mina with new hope. For it will be hope\\nwhen you think it over: that all is not lost. This very creature that we\\npursue, he take hundreds of years to get so far as London; and yet in\\none day, when we know of the disposal of him we drive him out. He is\\nfinite, though he is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do.\\nBut we are strong, each in our purpose; and we are all more strong\\ntogether. Take heart afresh, dear husband of Madam Mina. This battle is\\nbut begun, and in the end we shall win--so sure as that God sits on high\\nto watch over His children. Therefore be of much comfort till we return.\\n\\nVAN HELSING.\\n\\n\\n_Jonathan Harker’s Journal._\\n\\n_4 October._--When I read to Mina, Van Helsing’s message in the\\nphonograph, the poor girl brightened up considerably. Already the\\ncertainty that the Count is out of the country has given her comfort;\\nand comfort is strength to her. For my own part, now that his horrible\\ndanger is not face to face with us, it seems almost impossible to\\nbelieve in it. Even my own terrible experiences in Castle Dracula seem\\nlike a long-forgotten dream. Here in the crisp autumn air in the bright\\nsunlight----\\n\\nAlas! how can I disbelieve! In the midst of my thought my eye fell on\\nthe red scar on my poor darling’s white forehead. Whilst that lasts,\\nthere can be no disbelief. And afterwards the very memory of it will\\nkeep faith crystal clear. Mina and I fear to be idle, so we have been\\nover all the diaries again and again. Somehow, although the reality\\nseems greater each time, the pain and the fear seem less. There is\\nsomething of a guiding purpose manifest throughout, which is comforting.\\nMina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good. It may\\nbe! I shall try to think as she does. We have never spoken to each other\\nyet of the future. It is better to wait till we see the Professor and\\nthe others after their investigations.\\n\\nThe day is running by more quickly than I ever thought a day could run\\nfor me again. It is now three o’clock.\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker’s Journal._\\n\\n_5 October, 5 p. m._--Our meeting for report. Present: Professor Van\\nHelsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey Morris, Jonathan\\nHarker, Mina Harker.\\n\\nDr. Van Helsing described what steps were taken during the day to\\ndiscover on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his escape:--\\n\\n“As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure that\\nhe must go by the Danube mouth; or by somewhere in the Black Sea, since\\nby that way he come. It was a dreary blank that was before us. _Omne\\nignotum pro magnifico_; and so with heavy hearts we start to find what\\nships leave for the Black Sea last night. He was in sailing ship, since\\nMadam Mina tell of sails being set. These not so important as to go in\\nyour list of the shipping in the _Times_, and so we go, by suggestion of\\nLord Godalming, to your Lloyd’s, where are note of all ships that sail,\\nhowever so small. There we find that only one Black-Sea-bound ship go\\nout with the tide. She is the _Czarina Catherine_, and she sail from\\nDoolittle’s Wharf for Varna, and thence on to other parts and up the\\nDanube. ‘Soh!’ said I, ‘this is the ship whereon is the Count.’ So off\\nwe go to Doolittle’s Wharf, and there we find a man in an office of wood\\nso small that the man look bigger than the office. From him we inquire\\nof the goings of the _Czarina Catherine_. He swear much, and he red face\\nand loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same; and when Quincey\\ngive him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and\\nput it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, he\\nstill better fellow and humble servant to us. He come with us, and ask\\nmany men who are rough and hot; these be better fellows too when they\\nhave been no more thirsty. They say much of blood and bloom, and of\\nothers which I comprehend not, though I guess what they mean; but\\nnevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know.\\n\\n“They make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about five\\no’clock comes a man so hurry. A tall man, thin and pale, with high nose\\nand teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning. That he be all in\\nblack, except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the\\ntime. That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship\\nsails for the Black Sea and for where. Some took him to the office and\\nthen to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of\\ngang-plank, and ask that the captain come to him. The captain come, when\\ntold that he will be pay well; and though he swear much at the first he\\nagree to term. Then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse\\nand cart can be hired. He go there and soon he come again, himself\\ndriving cart on which a great box; this he himself lift down, though it\\ntake several to put it on truck for the ship. He give much talk to\\ncaptain as to how and where his box is to be place; but the captain like\\nit not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him that if he like he\\ncan come and see where it shall be. But he say ‘no’; that he come not\\nyet, for that he have much to do. Whereupon the captain tell him that he\\nhad better be quick--with blood--for that his ship will leave the\\nplace--of blood--before the turn of the tide--with blood. Then the thin\\nman smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit; but he\\nwill be surprise if he go quite so soon. The captain swear again,\\npolyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he\\nwill so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the\\nsailing. Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tell\\nhim that he doesn’t want no Frenchmen--with bloom upon them and also\\nwith blood--in his ship--with blood on her also. And so, after asking\\nwhere there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase ship\\nforms, he departed.\\n\\n“No one knew where he went ‘or bloomin’ well cared,’ as they said, for\\nthey had something else to think of--well with blood again; for it soon\\nbecame apparent to all that the _Czarina Catherine_ would not sail as\\nwas expected. A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew,\\nand grew; till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her.\\nThe captain swore polyglot--very polyglot--polyglot with bloom and\\nblood; but he could do nothing. The water rose and rose; and he began to\\nfear that he would lose the tide altogether. He was in no friendly mood,\\nwhen just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang-plank again and\\nasked to see where his box had been stowed. Then the captain replied\\nthat he wished that he and his box--old and with much bloom and\\nblood--were in hell. But the thin man did not be offend, and went down\\nwith the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile\\non deck in fog. He must have come off by himself, for none notice him.\\nIndeed they thought not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away, and\\nall was clear again. My friends of the thirst and the language that was\\nof bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain’s swears\\nexceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of\\npicturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up\\nand down on the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen any\\nof fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. However, the ship\\nwent out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down the\\nriver mouth. She was by then, when they told us, well out to sea.\\n\\n“And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time, for\\nour enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to the\\nDanube mouth. To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick; and when\\nwe start we go on land more quick, and we meet him there. Our best hope\\nis to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for then\\nhe can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should. There\\nare days for us, in which we can make ready our plan. We know all about\\nwhere he go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us\\ninvoices and all papers that can be. The box we seek is to be landed in\\nVarna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present\\nhis credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part.\\nWhen he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph and\\nhave inquiry made at Varna, we say ‘no’; for what is to be done is not\\nfor police or of the customs. It must be done by us alone and in our own\\nway.”\\n\\nWhen Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if he were certain\\nthat the Count had remained on board the ship. He replied: “We have the\\nbest proof of that: your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance this\\nmorning.” I asked him again if it were really necessary that they should\\npursue the Count, for oh! I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I know that\\nhe would surely go if the others went. He answered in growing passion,\\nat first quietly. As he went on, however, he grew more angry and more\\nforceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some\\nof that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst\\nmen:--\\n\\n“Yes, it is necessary--necessary--necessary! For your sake in the first,\\nand then for the sake of humanity. This monster has done much harm\\nalready, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the short\\ntime when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in\\ndarkness and not knowing. All this have I told these others; you, my\\ndear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John, or\\nin that of your husband. I have told them how the measure of leaving his\\nown barren land--barren of peoples--and coming to a new land where life\\nof man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was the\\nwork of centuries. Were another of the Un-Dead, like him, to try to do\\nwhat he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have\\nbeen, or that will be, could aid him. With this one, all the forces of\\nnature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in\\nsome wondrous way. The very place, where he have been alive, Un-Dead for\\nall these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical\\nworld. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither.\\nThere have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters\\nof strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless,\\nthere is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of\\noccult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and in\\nhimself were from the first some great qualities. In a hard and warlike\\ntime he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more subtle brain,\\nmore braver heart, than any man. In him some vital principle have in\\nstrange way found their utmost; and as his body keep strong and grow and\\nthrive, so his brain grow too. All this without that diabolic aid which\\nis surely to him; for it have to yield to the powers that come from,\\nand are, symbolic of good. And now this is what he is to us. He have\\ninfect you--oh, forgive me, my dear, that I must say such; but it is for\\ngood of you that I speak. He infect you in such wise, that even if he do\\nno more, you have only to live--to live in your own old, sweet way; and\\nso in time, death, which is of man’s common lot and with God’s sanction,\\nshall make you like to him. This must not be! We have sworn together\\nthat it must not. Thus are we ministers of God’s own wish: that the\\nworld, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters,\\nwhose very existence would defame Him. He have allowed us to redeem one\\nsoul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem\\nmore. Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise; and like them, if\\nwe fall, we fall in good cause.” He paused and I said:--\\n\\n“But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely? Since he has been driven\\nfrom England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from\\nwhich he has been hunted?”\\n\\n“Aha!” he said, “your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall\\nadopt him. Your man-eater, as they of India call the tiger who has once\\ntasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but prowl\\nunceasing till he get him. This that we hunt from our village is a\\ntiger, too, a man-eater, and he never cease to prowl. Nay, in himself he\\nis not one to retire and stay afar. In his life, his living life, he go\\nover the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground; he be\\nbeaten back, but did he stay? No! He come again, and again, and again.\\nLook at his persistence and endurance. With the child-brain that was to\\nhim he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. What\\ndoes he do? He find out the place of all the world most of promise for\\nhim. Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task. He\\nfind in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers. He\\nstudy new tongues. He learn new social life; new environment of old\\nways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new\\nland and a new people who have come to be since he was. His glimpse that\\nhe have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire. Nay, it help\\nhim to grow as to his brain; for it all prove to him how right he was at\\nthe first in his surmises. He have done this alone; all alone! from a\\nruin tomb in a forgotten land. What more may he not do when the greater\\nworld of thought is open to him. He that can smile at death, as we know\\nhim; who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole\\npeoples. Oh, if such an one was to come from God, and not the Devil,\\nwhat a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours. But we\\nare pledged to set the world free. Our toil must be in silence, and our\\nefforts all in secret; for in this enlightened age, when men believe not\\neven what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greatest\\nstrength. It would be at once his sheath and his armour, and his weapons\\nto destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own souls\\nfor the safety of one we love--for the good of mankind, and for the\\nhonour and glory of God.”\\n\\nAfter a general discussion it was determined that for to-night nothing\\nbe definitely settled; that we should all sleep on the facts, and try to\\nthink out the proper conclusions. To-morrow, at breakfast, we are to\\nmeet again, and, after making our conclusions known to one another, we\\nshall decide on some definite cause of action.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nI feel a wonderful peace and rest to-night. It is as if some haunting\\npresence were removed from me. Perhaps ...\\n\\nMy surmise was not finished, could not be; for I caught sight in the\\nmirror of the red mark upon my forehead; and I knew that I was still\\nunclean.\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n_5 October._--We all rose early, and I think that sleep did much for\\neach and all of us. When we met at early breakfast there was more\\ngeneral cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience\\nagain.\\n\\nIt is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Let\\nany obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way--even by\\ndeath--and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. More\\nthan once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether\\nthe whole of the past days had not been a dream. It was only when I\\ncaught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker’s forehead that I was\\nbrought back to reality. Even now, when I am gravely revolving the\\nmatter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our\\ntrouble is still existent. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her\\ntrouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when something\\nrecalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are to\\nmeet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of\\naction. I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct\\nrather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fear\\nthat in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker’s tongue is tied. I _know_\\nthat she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I can\\nguess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, or\\ncannot, give them utterance. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and\\nhe and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose it is some of\\nthat horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. The\\nCount had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called “the\\nVampire’s baptism of blood.” Well, there may be a poison that distils\\nitself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is\\na mystery we should not wonder at anything! One thing I know: that if my\\ninstinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker’s silences, then there is a\\nterrible difficulty--an unknown danger--in the work before us. The same\\npower that compels her silence may compel her speech. I dare not think\\nfurther; for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman!\\n\\nVan Helsing is coming to my study a little before the others. I shall\\ntry to open the subject with him.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later._--When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of\\nthings. I could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted to\\nsay, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beating\\nabout the bush a little, he said suddenly:--\\n\\n“Friend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone, just\\nat the first at any rate. Later, we may have to take the others into our\\nconfidence”; then he stopped, so I waited; he went on:--\\n\\n“Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing.” A cold shiver ran\\nthrough me to find my worst fears thus endorsed. Van Helsing\\ncontinued:--\\n\\n“With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned\\nbefore things go too far. Our task is now in reality more difficult than\\never, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. I\\ncan see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face. It is now\\nbut very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice\\nwithout to prejudge. Her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyes\\nare more hard. But these are not all, there is to her the silence now\\noften; as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even when she\\nwrote that which she wished to be known later. Now my fear is this. If\\nit be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and\\nhear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first, and who\\nhave drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if he\\nwill, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?” I nodded\\nacquiescence; he went on:--\\n\\n“Then, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her ignorant of\\nour intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not. This is a painful\\ntask! Oh, so painful that it heart-break me to think of; but it must be.\\nWhen to-day we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will not\\nto speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded by\\nus.” He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration\\nat the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor\\nsoul already so tortured. I knew that it would be some sort of comfort\\nto him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion; for at\\nany rate it would take away the pain of doubt. I told him, and the\\neffect was as I expected.\\n\\nIt is now close to the time of our general gathering. Van Helsing has\\ngone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it. I\\nreally believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later._--At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was\\nexperienced by both Van Helsing and myself. Mrs. Harker had sent a\\nmessage by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, as\\nshe thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements\\nwithout her presence to embarrass us. The Professor and I looked at each\\nother for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved. For my own\\npart, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realised the danger herself, it was\\nmuch pain as well as much danger averted. Under the circumstances we\\nagreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to\\npreserve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been able to\\nconfer alone again. We went at once into our Plan of Campaign. Van\\nHelsing roughly put the facts before us first:--\\n\\n“The _Czarina Catherine_ left the Thames yesterday morning. It will take\\nher at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to\\nreach Varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three days.\\nNow, if we allow for two days less for the ship’s voyage, owing to such\\nweather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear; and if\\nwe allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us,\\nthen we have a margin of nearly two weeks. Thus, in order to be quite\\nsafe, we must leave here on 17th at latest. Then we shall at any rate\\nbe in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make such\\npreparations as may be necessary. Of course we shall all go armed--armed\\nagainst evil things, spiritual as well as physical.” Here Quincey Morris\\nadded:--\\n\\n“I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and it may be\\nthat he shall get there before us. I propose that we add Winchesters to\\nour armament. I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any\\ntrouble of that sort around. Do you remember, Art, when we had the pack\\nafter us at Tobolsk? What wouldn’t we have given then for a repeater\\napiece!”\\n\\n“Good!” said Van Helsing, “Winchesters it shall be. Quincey’s head is\\nlevel at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be more\\ndishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man. In the meantime we\\ncan do nothing here; and as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of\\nus, why not go there more soon? It is as long to wait here as there.\\nTo-night and to-morrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, we\\nfour can set out on our journey.”\\n\\n“We four?” said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of\\nus.\\n\\n“Of course!” answered the Professor quickly, “you must remain to take\\ncare of your so sweet wife!” Harker was silent for awhile and then said\\nin a hollow voice:--\\n\\n“Let us talk of that part of it in the morning. I want to consult with\\nMina.” I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him not\\nto disclose our plans to her; but he took no notice. I looked at him\\nsignificantly and coughed. For answer he put his finger on his lips and\\nturned away.\\n\\n\\n_Jonathan Harker’s Journal._\\n\\n_5 October, afternoon._--For some time after our meeting this morning I\\ncould not think. The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of\\nwonder which allows no room for active thought. Mina’s determination not\\nto take any part in the discussion set me thinking; and as I could not\\nargue the matter with her, I could only guess. I am as far as ever from\\na solution now. The way the others received it, too, puzzled me; the\\nlast time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no\\nmore concealment of anything amongst us. Mina is sleeping now, calmly\\nand sweetly like a little child. Her lips are curved and her face beams\\nwith happiness. Thank God, there are such moments still for her.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later._--How strange it all is. I sat watching Mina’s happy sleep, and\\ncame as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be. As the\\nevening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking\\nlower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me. All at\\nonce Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly, said:--\\n\\n“Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour. A\\npromise made to me, but made holily in God’s hearing, and not to be\\nbroken though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter\\ntears. Quick, you must make it to me at once.”\\n\\n“Mina,” I said, “a promise like that, I cannot make at once. I may have\\nno right to make it.”\\n\\n“But, dear one,” she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes\\nwere like pole stars, “it is I who wish it; and it is not for myself.\\nYou can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right; if he disagrees you may\\ndo as you will. Nay, more, if you all agree, later, you are absolved\\nfrom the promise.”\\n\\n“I promise!” I said, and for a moment she looked supremely happy; though\\nto me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead.\\nShe said:--\\n\\n“Promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed for\\nthe campaign against the Count. Not by word, or inference, or\\nimplication; not at any time whilst this remains to me!” and she\\nsolemnly pointed to the scar. I saw that she was in earnest, and said\\nsolemnly:--\\n\\n“I promise!” and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door had\\nbeen shut between us.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later, midnight._--Mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening.\\nSo much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected\\nsomewhat with her gaiety; as a result even I myself felt as if the pall\\nof gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted. We all retired\\nearly. Mina is now sleeping like a little child; it is a wonderful thing\\nthat her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible\\ntrouble. Thank God for it, for then at least she can forget her care.\\nPerhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did to-night. I shall\\ntry it. Oh! for a dreamless sleep.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_6 October, morning._--Another surprise. Mina woke me early, about the\\nsame time as yesterday, and asked me to bring Dr. Van Helsing. I thought\\nthat it was another occasion for hypnotism, and without question went\\nfor the Professor. He had evidently expected some such call, for I found\\nhim dressed in his room. His door was ajar, so that he could hear the\\nopening of the door of our room. He came at once; as he passed into the\\nroom, he asked Mina if the others might come, too.\\n\\n“No,” she said quite simply, “it will not be necessary. You can tell\\nthem just as well. I must go with you on your journey.”\\n\\nDr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was. After a moment’s pause he\\nasked:--\\n\\n“But why?”\\n\\n“You must take me with you. I am safer with you, and you shall be safer,\\ntoo.”\\n\\n“But why, dear Madam Mina? You know that your safety is our solemnest\\nduty. We go into danger, to which you are, or may be, more liable than\\nany of us from--from circumstances--things that have been.” He paused,\\nembarrassed.\\n\\nAs she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead:--\\n\\n“I know. That is why I must go. I can tell you now, whilst the sun is\\ncoming up; I may not be able again. I know that when the Count wills me\\nI must go. I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must come by\\nwile; by any device to hoodwink--even Jonathan.” God saw the look that\\nshe turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a Recording Angel\\nthat look is noted to her everlasting honour. I could only clasp her\\nhand. I could not speak; my emotion was too great for even the relief of\\ntears. She went on:--\\n\\n“You men are brave and strong. You are strong in your numbers, for you\\ncan defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had\\nto guard alone. Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotise me\\nand so learn that which even I myself do not know.” Dr. Van Helsing said\\nvery gravely:--\\n\\n“Madam Mina, you are, as always, most wise. You shall with us come; and\\ntogether we shall do that which we go forth to achieve.” When he had\\nspoken, Mina’s long spell of silence made me look at her. She had fallen\\nback on her pillow asleep; she did not even wake when I had pulled up\\nthe blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room. Van Helsing\\nmotioned to me to come with him quietly. We went to his room, and within\\na minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also.\\nHe told them what Mina had said, and went on:--\\n\\n“In the morning we shall leave for Varna. We have now to deal with a\\nnew factor: Madam Mina. Oh, but her soul is true. It is to her an agony\\nto tell us so much as she has done; but it is most right, and we are\\nwarned in time. There must be no chance lost, and in Varna we must be\\nready to act the instant when that ship arrives.”\\n\\n“What shall we do exactly?” asked Mr. Morris laconically. The Professor\\npaused before replying:--\\n\\n“We shall at the first board that ship; then, when we have identified\\nthe box, we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it. This we shall\\nfasten, for when it is there none can emerge; so at least says the\\nsuperstition. And to superstition must we trust at the first; it was\\nman’s faith in the early, and it have its root in faith still. Then,\\nwhen we get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we\\nshall open the box, and--and all will be well.”\\n\\n“I shall not wait for any opportunity,” said Morris. “When I see the box\\nI shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a thousand\\nmen looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment!” I\\ngrasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel.\\nI think he understood my look; I hope he did.\\n\\n“Good boy,” said Dr. Van Helsing. “Brave boy. Quincey is all man. God\\nbless him for it. My child, believe me none of us shall lag behind or\\npause from any fear. I do but say what we may do--what we must do. But,\\nindeed, indeed we cannot say what we shall do. There are so many things\\nwhich may happen, and their ways and their ends are so various that\\nuntil the moment we may not say. We shall all be armed, in all ways; and\\nwhen the time for the end has come, our effort shall not be lack. Now\\nlet us to-day put all our affairs in order. Let all things which touch\\non others dear to us, and who on us depend, be complete; for none of us\\ncan tell what, or when, or how, the end may be. As for me, my own\\naffairs are regulate; and as I have nothing else to do, I shall go make\\narrangements for the travel. I shall have all tickets and so forth for\\nour journey.”\\n\\nThere was nothing further to be said, and we parted. I shall now settle\\nup all my affairs of earth, and be ready for whatever may come....\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later._--It is all done; my will is made, and all complete. Mina if she\\nsurvive is my sole heir. If it should not be so, then the others who\\nhave been so good to us shall have remainder.\\n\\nIt is now drawing towards the sunset; Mina’s uneasiness calls my\\nattention to it. I am sure that there is something on her mind which the\\ntime of exact sunset will reveal. These occasions are becoming harrowing\\ntimes for us all, for each sunrise and sunset opens up some new\\ndanger--some new pain, which, however, may in God’s will be means to a\\ngood end. I write all these things in the diary since my darling must\\nnot hear them now; but if it may be that she can see them again, they\\nshall be ready.\\n\\nShe is calling to me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV\\n\\nDR. SEWARD’S DIARY\\n\\n\\n_11 October, Evening._--Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this, as he\\nsays he is hardly equal to the task, and he wants an exact record kept.\\n\\nI think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs.\\nHarker a little before the time of sunset. We have of late come to\\nunderstand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom;\\nwhen her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing\\nor restraining her, or inciting her to action. This mood or condition\\nbegins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts\\ntill either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with\\nthe rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort of\\nnegative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute\\nfreedom quickly follows; when, however, the freedom ceases the\\nchange-back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of\\nwarning silence.\\n\\nTo-night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the\\nsigns of an internal struggle. I put it down myself to her making a\\nviolent effort at the earliest instant she could do so. A very few\\nminutes, however, gave her complete control of herself; then, motioning\\nher husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining,\\nshe made the rest of us bring chairs up close. Taking her husband’s hand\\nin hers began:--\\n\\n“We are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time! I know,\\ndear; I know that you will always be with me to the end.” This was to\\nher husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon hers. “In\\nthe morning we go out upon our task, and God alone knows what may be in\\nstore for any of us. You are going to be so good to me as to take me\\nwith you. I know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak\\nwoman, whose soul perhaps is lost--no, no, not yet, but is at any rate\\nat stake--you will do. But you must remember that I am not as you are.\\nThere is a poison in my blood, in my soul, which may destroy me; which\\nmust destroy me, unless some relief comes to us. Oh, my friends, you\\nknow as well as I do, that my soul is at stake; and though I know there\\nis one way out for me, you must not and I must not take it!” She looked\\nappealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with her husband.\\n\\n“What is that way?” asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice. “What is that\\nway, which we must not--may not--take?”\\n\\n“That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, before\\nthe greater evil is entirely wrought. I know, and you know, that were I\\nonce dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as you\\ndid my poor Lucy’s. Were death, or the fear of death, the only thing\\nthat stood in the way I would not shrink to die here, now, amidst the\\nfriends who love me. But death is not all. I cannot believe that to die\\nin such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be\\ndone, is God’s will. Therefore, I, on my part, give up here the\\ncertainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the\\nblackest things that the world or the nether world holds!” We were all\\nsilent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude. The\\nfaces of the others were set and Harker’s grew ashen grey; perhaps he\\nguessed better than any of us what was coming. She continued:--\\n\\n“This is what I can give into the hotch-pot.” I could not but note the\\nquaint legal phrase which she used in such a place, and with all\\nseriousness. “What will each of you give? Your lives I know,” she went\\non quickly, “that is easy for brave men. Your lives are God’s, and you\\ncan give them back to Him; but what will you give to me?” She looked\\nagain questioningly, but this time avoided her husband’s face. Quincey\\nseemed to understand; he nodded, and her face lit up. “Then I shall tell\\nyou plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in this\\nconnection between us now. You must promise me, one and all--even you,\\nmy beloved husband--that, should the time come, you will kill me.”\\n\\n“What is that time?” The voice was Quincey’s, but it was low and\\nstrained.\\n\\n“When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better that\\nI die than I may live. When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will,\\nwithout a moment’s delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head;\\nor do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!”\\n\\nQuincey was the first to rise after the pause. He knelt down before her\\nand taking her hand in his said solemnly:--\\n\\n“I’m only a rough fellow, who hasn’t, perhaps, lived as a man should to\\nwin such a distinction, but I swear to you by all that I hold sacred and\\ndear that, should the time ever come, I shall not flinch from the duty\\nthat you have set us. And I promise you, too, that I shall make all\\ncertain, for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has\\ncome!”\\n\\n“My true friend!” was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as,\\nbending over, she kissed his hand.\\n\\n“I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!” said Van Helsing.\\n\\n“And I!” said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to\\ntake the oath. I followed, myself. Then her husband turned to her\\nwan-eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of\\nhis hair, and asked:--\\n\\n“And must I, too, make such a promise, oh, my wife?”\\n\\n“You too, my dearest,” she said, with infinite yearning of pity in her\\nvoice and eyes. “You must not shrink. You are nearest and dearest and\\nall the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life and all\\ntime. Think, dear, that there have been times when brave men have killed\\ntheir wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling into the\\nhands of the enemy. Their hands did not falter any the more because\\nthose that they loved implored them to slay them. It is men’s duty\\ntowards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial! And oh, my\\ndear, if it is to be that I must meet death at any hand, let it be at\\nthe hand of him that loves me best. Dr. Van Helsing, I have not\\nforgotten your mercy in poor Lucy’s case to him who loved”--she stopped\\nwith a flying blush, and changed her phrase--“to him who had best right\\nto give her peace. If that time shall come again, I look to you to make\\nit a happy memory of my husband’s life that it was his loving hand which\\nset me free from the awful thrall upon me.”\\n\\n“Again I swear!” came the Professor’s resonant voice. Mrs. Harker\\nsmiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of relief she leaned back and\\nsaid:--\\n\\n“And now one word of warning, a warning which you must never forget:\\nthis time, if it ever come, may come quickly and unexpectedly, and in\\nsuch case you must lose no time in using your opportunity. At such a\\ntime I myself might be--nay! if the time ever comes, _shall be_--leagued\\nwith your enemy against you.”\\n\\n“One more request;” she became very solemn as she said this, “it is not\\nvital and necessary like the other, but I want you to do one thing for\\nme, if you will.” We all acquiesced, but no one spoke; there was no need\\nto speak:--\\n\\n“I want you to read the Burial Service.” She was interrupted by a deep\\ngroan from her husband; taking his hand in hers, she held it over her\\nheart, and continued: “You must read it over me some day. Whatever may\\nbe the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will be a sweet\\nthought to all or some of us. You, my dearest, will I hope read it, for\\nthen it will be in your voice in my memory for ever--come what may!”\\n\\n“But oh, my dear one,” he pleaded, “death is afar off from you.”\\n\\n“Nay,” she said, holding up a warning hand. “I am deeper in death at\\nthis moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!”\\n\\n“Oh, my wife, must I read it?” he said, before he began.\\n\\n“It would comfort me, my husband!” was all she said; and he began to\\nread when she had got the book ready.\\n\\n“How can I--how could any one--tell of that strange scene, its\\nsolemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror; and, withal, its\\nsweetness. Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter\\ntruth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart\\nhad he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling\\nround that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion of\\nher husband’s voice, as in tones so broken with emotion that often he\\nhad to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burial\\nof the Dead. I--I cannot go on--words--and--v-voice--f-fail m-me!”\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nShe was right in her instinct. Strange as it all was, bizarre as it may\\nhereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time, it\\ncomforted us much; and the silence, which showed Mrs. Harker’s coming\\nrelapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair to any\\nof us as we had dreaded.\\n\\n\\n_Jonathan Harker’s Journal._\\n\\n_15 October, Varna._--We left Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th,\\ngot to Paris the same night, and took the places secured for us in the\\nOrient Express. We travelled night and day, arriving here at about five\\no’clock. Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram had\\narrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel--“the\\nOdessus.” The journey may have had incidents; I was, however, too eager\\nto get on, to care for them. Until the _Czarina Catherine_ comes into\\nport there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world.\\nThank God! Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger; her colour is\\ncoming back. She sleeps a great deal; throughout the journey she slept\\nnearly all the time. Before sunrise and sunset, however, she is very\\nwakeful and alert; and it has become a habit for Van Helsing to\\nhypnotise her at such times. At first, some effort was needed, and he\\nhad to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at once, as if by\\nhabit, and scarcely any action is needed. He seems to have power at\\nthese particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him. He\\nalways asks her what she can see and hear. She answers to the first:--\\n\\n“Nothing; all is dark.” And to the second:--\\n\\n“I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushing\\nby. Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak. The wind is\\nhigh--I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam.”\\nIt is evident that the _Czarina Catherine_ is still at sea, hastening on\\nher way to Varna. Lord Godalming has just returned. He had four\\ntelegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect:\\nthat the _Czarina Catherine_ had not been reported to Lloyd’s from\\nanywhere. He had arranged before leaving London that his agent should\\nsend him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported. He\\nwas to have a message even if she were not reported, so that he might be\\nsure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire.\\n\\nWe had dinner and went to bed early. To-morrow we are to see the\\nVice-Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the ship\\nas soon as she arrives. Van Helsing says that our chance will be to get\\non the boat between sunrise and sunset. The Count, even if he takes the\\nform of a bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, and\\nso cannot leave the ship. As he dare not change to man’s form without\\nsuspicion--which he evidently wishes to avoid--he must remain in the\\nbox. If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, he is at our mercy;\\nfor we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of poor Lucy,\\nbefore he wakes. What mercy he shall get from us will not count for\\nmuch. We think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the\\nseamen. Thank God! this is the country where bribery can do anything,\\nand we are well supplied with money. We have only to make sure that the\\nship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being\\nwarned, and we shall be safe. Judge Moneybag will settle this case, I\\nthink!\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_16 October._--Mina’s report still the same: lapping waves and rushing\\nwater, darkness and favouring winds. We are evidently in good time, and\\nwhen we hear of the _Czarina Catherine_ we shall be ready. As she must\\npass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_17 October._--Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think, to welcome\\nthe Count on his return from his tour. Godalming told the shippers that\\nhe fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from\\na friend of his, and got a half consent that he might open it at his own\\nrisk. The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him every\\nfacility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also a\\nsimilar authorisation to his agent at Varna. We have seen the agent, who\\nwas much impressed with Godalming’s kindly manner to him, and we are all\\nsatisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done. We\\nhave already arranged what to do in case we get the box open. If the\\nCount is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at once and\\ndrive a stake through his heart. Morris and Godalming and I shall\\nprevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shall\\nhave ready. The Professor says that if we can so treat the Count’s body,\\nit will soon after fall into dust. In such case there would be no\\nevidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused. But\\neven if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhaps\\nsome day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and\\na rope. For myself, I should take the chance only too thankfully if it\\nwere to come. We mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out our\\nintent. We have arranged with certain officials that the instant the\\n_Czarina Catherine_ is seen, we are to be informed by a special\\nmessenger.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_24 October._--A whole week of waiting. Daily telegrams to Godalming,\\nbut only the same story: “Not yet reported.” Mina’s morning and evening\\nhypnotic answer is unvaried: lapping waves, rushing water, and creaking\\nmasts.\\n\\n_Telegram, October 24th._\\n\\n_Rufus Smith, Lloyd’s, London, to Lord Godalming, care of H. B. M.\\nVice-Consul, Varna._\\n\\n“_Czarina Catherine_ reported this morning from Dardanelles.”\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n_25 October._--How I miss my phonograph! To write diary with a pen is\\nirksome to me; but Van Helsing says I must. We were all wild with\\nexcitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyd’s. I\\nknow now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. Mrs.\\nHarker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. After\\nall, it is not strange that she did not; for we took special care not to\\nlet her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any\\nexcitement when we were in her presence. In old days she would, I am\\nsure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it; but\\nin this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks. The\\nlethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and is\\ngetting back some of her colour, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied. We\\ntalk of her often; we have not, however, said a word to the others. It\\nwould break poor Harker’s heart--certainly his nerve--if he knew that we\\nhad even a suspicion on the subject. Van Helsing examines, he tells me,\\nher teeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, for\\nhe says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active\\ndanger of a change in her. If this change should come, it would be\\nnecessary to take steps!... We both know what those steps would have to\\nbe, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other. We should\\nneither of us shrink from the task--awful though it be to contemplate.\\n“Euthanasia” is an excellent and a comforting word! I am grateful to\\nwhoever invented it.\\n\\nIt is only about 24 hours’ sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the\\nrate the _Czarina Catherine_ has come from London. She should therefore\\narrive some time in the morning; but as she cannot possibly get in\\nbefore then, we are all about to retire early. We shall get up at one\\no’clock, so as to be ready.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_25 October, Noon_.--No news yet of the ship’s arrival. Mrs. Harker’s\\nhypnotic report this morning was the same as usual, so it is possible\\nthat we may get news at any moment. We men are all in a fever of\\nexcitement, except Harker, who is calm; his hands are cold as ice, and\\nan hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knife\\nwhich he now always carries with him. It will be a bad lookout for the\\nCount if the edge of that “Kukri” ever touches his throat, driven by\\nthat stern, ice-cold hand!\\n\\nVan Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs. Harker to-day. About\\nnoon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like; although we\\nkept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy about it. She\\nhad been restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to know\\nthat she was sleeping. When, however, her husband mentioned casually\\nthat she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her, we went to\\nher room to see for ourselves. She was breathing naturally and looked so\\nwell and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than\\nanything else. Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is no wonder\\nthat sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her good.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later._--Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleep\\nof some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she had\\nbeen for days. At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report. Wherever he\\nmay be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his destination. To\\nhis doom, I trust!\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_26 October._--Another day and no tidings of the _Czarina Catherine_.\\nShe ought to be here by now. That she is still journeying _somewhere_ is\\napparent, for Mrs. Harker’s hypnotic report at sunrise was still the\\nsame. It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog;\\nsome of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog\\nboth to north and south of the port. We must continue our watching, as\\nthe ship may now be signalled any moment.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_27 October, Noon._--Most strange; no news yet of the ship we wait for.\\nMrs. Harker reported last night and this morning as usual: “lapping\\nwaves and rushing water,” though she added that “the waves were very\\nfaint.” The telegrams from London have been the same: “no further\\nreport.” Van Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now that he\\nfears the Count is escaping us. He added significantly:--\\n\\n“I did not like that lethargy of Madam Mina’s. Souls and memories can do\\nstrange things during trance.” I was about to ask him more, but Harker\\njust then came in, and he held up a warning hand. We must try to-night\\nat sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n     _28 October._--Telegram. _Rufus Smith, London, to Lord Godalming,\\n     care H. B. M. Vice Consul, Varna._\\n\\n     “_Czarina Catherine_ reported entering Galatz at one o’clock\\n     to-day.”\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n_28 October._--When the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz I\\ndo not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have been\\nexpected. True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would\\ncome; but I think we all expected that something strange would happen.\\nThe delay of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things\\nwould not be just as we had expected; we only waited to learn where the\\nchange would occur. None the less, however, was it a surprise. I suppose\\nthat nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against\\nourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should know\\nthat they will be. Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if\\nit be a will-o’-the-wisp to man. It was an odd experience and we all\\ntook it differently. Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for a\\nmoment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty; but he said not a\\nword, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set. Lord\\nGodalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily. I was myself half\\nstunned and looked in wonder at one after another. Quincey Morris\\ntightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well; in our\\nold wandering days it meant “action.” Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, so\\nthat the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her hands\\nmeekly and looked up in prayer. Harker smiled--actually smiled--the\\ndark, bitter smile of one who is without hope; but at the same time his\\naction belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of\\nthe great Kukri knife and rested there. “When does the next train start\\nfor Galatz?” said Van Helsing to us generally.\\n\\n“At 6:30 to-morrow morning!” We all started, for the answer came from\\nMrs. Harker.\\n\\n“How on earth do you know?” said Art.\\n\\n“You forget--or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and so\\ndoes Dr. Van Helsing--that I am the train fiend. At home in Exeter I\\nalways used to make up the time-tables, so as to be helpful to my\\nhusband. I found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a study of\\nthe time-tables now. I knew that if anything were to take us to Castle\\nDracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest, so I\\nlearned the times very carefully. Unhappily there are not many to learn,\\nas the only train to-morrow leaves as I say.”\\n\\n“Wonderful woman!” murmured the Professor.\\n\\n“Can’t we get a special?” asked Lord Godalming. Van Helsing shook his\\nhead: “I fear not. This land is very different from yours or mine; even\\nif we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our\\nregular train. Moreover, we have something to prepare. We must think.\\nNow let us organize. You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get the\\ntickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning. Do\\nyou, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him\\nletters to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make search the ship\\njust as it was here. Morris Quincey, you see the Vice-Consul, and get\\nhis aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way\\nsmooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube. John will stay\\nwith Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult. For so if time be long you\\nmay be delayed; and it will not matter when the sun set, since I am here\\nwith Madam to make report.”\\n\\n“And I,” said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than she\\nhad been for many a long day, “shall try to be of use in all ways, and\\nshall think and write for you as I used to do. Something is shifting\\nfrom me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!”\\nThe three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to\\nrealise the significance of her words; but Van Helsing and I, turning to\\neach other, met each a grave and troubled glance. We said nothing at the\\ntime, however.\\n\\nWhen the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs.\\nHarker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of\\nHarker’s journal at the Castle. She went away to get it; when the door\\nwas shut upon her he said to me:--\\n\\n“We mean the same! speak out!”\\n\\n“There is some change. It is a hope that makes me sick, for it may\\ndeceive us.”\\n\\n“Quite so. Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?”\\n\\n“No!” said I, “unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone.”\\n\\n“You are in part right, friend John, but only in part. I want to tell\\nyou something. And oh, my friend, I am taking a great--a terrible--risk;\\nbut I believe it is right. In the moment when Madam Mina said those\\nwords that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me. In\\nthe trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read her\\nmind; or more like he took her to see him in his earth-box in the ship\\nwith water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun. He learn\\nthen that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open life with\\neyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his coffin-box.\\nNow he make his most effort to escape us. At present he want her not.\\n\\n“He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call;\\nbut he cut her off--take her, as he can do, out of his own power, that\\nso she come not to him. Ah! there I have hope that our man-brains that\\nhave been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will\\ncome higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries,\\nthat grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and\\ntherefore small. Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to her of her trance!\\nShe know it not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when\\nwe want all her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her great\\nbrain which is trained like man’s brain, but is of sweet woman and have\\na special power which the Count give her, and which he may not take away\\naltogether--though he think not so. Hush! let me speak, and you shall\\nlearn. Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits. I fear, as I never\\nfeared before. We can only trust the good God. Silence! here she comes!”\\n\\nI thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics,\\njust as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled\\nhimself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into\\nthe room, bright and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly\\nforgetful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of sheets\\nof typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his face\\nbrightening up as he read. Then holding the pages between his finger and\\nthumb he said:--\\n\\n“Friend John, to you with so much of experience already--and you, too,\\ndear Madam Mina, that are young--here is a lesson: do not fear ever to\\nthink. A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to\\nlet him loose his wings. Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to\\nwhere that half-thought come from and I find that he be no half-thought\\nat all; that be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet\\nstrong to use his little wings. Nay, like the “Ugly Duck” of my friend\\nHans Andersen, he be no duck-thought at all, but a big swan-thought that\\nsail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them. See I\\nread here what Jonathan have written:--\\n\\n“That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, brought\\nhis forces over The Great River into Turkey Land; who, when he was\\nbeaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come\\nalone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered,\\nsince he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph.”\\n\\n“What does this tell us? Not much? no! The Count’s child-thought see\\nnothing; therefore he speak so free. Your man-thought see nothing; my\\nman-thought see nothing, till just now. No! But there comes another word\\nfrom some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what\\nit mean--what it _might_ mean. Just as there are elements which rest,\\nyet when in nature’s course they move on their way and they touch--then\\npouf! and there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill\\nand destroy some; but that show up all earth below for leagues and\\nleagues. Is it not so? Well, I shall explain. To begin, have you ever\\nstudy the philosophy of crime? ‘Yes’ and ‘No.’ You, John, yes; for it is\\na study of insanity. You, no, Madam Mina; for crime touch you not--not\\nbut once. Still, your mind works true, and argues not _a particulari ad\\nuniversale_. There is this peculiarity in criminals. It is so constant,\\nin all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much\\nfrom philosophy, come to know it empirically, that _it is_. That is to\\nbe empiric. The criminal always work at one crime--that is the true\\ncriminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other.\\nThis criminal has not full man-brain. He is clever and cunning and\\nresourceful; but he be not of man-stature as to brain. He be of\\nchild-brain in much. Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime\\nalso; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what he\\nhave done. The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not\\nby principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then there is to\\nhim the ground to start from to do more. ‘_Dos pou sto_,’ said\\nArchimedes. ‘Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!’ To do once,\\nis the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until he have\\nthe purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every time,\\njust as he have done before! Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are\\nopened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues,” for\\nMrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled. He went on:--\\n\\n“Now you shall speak. Tell us two dry men of science what you see with\\nthose so bright eyes.” He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke.\\nHis finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and\\nunconsciously, as she spoke:--\\n\\n“The Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau and Lombroso would\\nso classify him, and _quâ_ criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind.\\nThus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit. His past is a\\nclue, and the one page of it that we know--and that from his own\\nlips--tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a\\n‘tight place,’ he went back to his own country from the land he had\\ntried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself\\nfor a new effort. He came again better equipped for his work; and won.\\nSo he came to London to invade a new land. He was beaten, and when all\\nhope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back over\\nthe sea to his home; just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube\\nfrom Turkey Land.”\\n\\n“Good, good! oh, you so clever lady!” said Van Helsing,\\nenthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand. A moment later he\\nsaid to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick-room\\nconsultation:--\\n\\n“Seventy-two only; and in all this excitement. I have hope.” Turning to\\nher again, he said with keen expectation:--\\n\\n“But go on. Go on! there is more to tell if you will. Be not afraid;\\nJohn and I know. I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right.\\nSpeak, without fear!”\\n\\n“I will try to; but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical.”\\n\\n“Nay! fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think.”\\n\\n“Then, as he is criminal he is selfish; and as his intellect is small\\nand his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one\\npurpose. That purpose is remorseless. As he fled back over the Danube,\\nleaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on being\\nsafe, careless of all. So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat\\nfrom the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful\\nnight. I felt it! Oh, I felt it! Thank God, for His great mercy! My soul\\nis freer than it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts me\\nis a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for\\nhis ends.” The Professor stood up:--\\n\\n“He has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna,\\nwhilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to\\nGalatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from us.\\nBut his child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is in\\nGod’s Providence, the very thing that the evil-doer most reckoned on for\\nhis selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. The hunter is taken\\nin his own snare, as the great Psalmist says. For now that he think he\\nis free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us with so\\nmany hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him to\\nsleep. He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind,\\nthere can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where he fail! That\\nterrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him\\nin spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when the\\nsun rise and set. At such times you go by my volition and not by his;\\nand this power to good of you and others, as you have won from your\\nsuffering at his hands. This is now all the more precious that he know\\nit not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his\\nknowledge of our where. We, however, are not selfish, and we believe\\nthat God is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark\\nhours. We shall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we peril\\nourselves that we become like him. Friend John, this has been a great\\nhour; and it have done much to advance us on our way. You must be scribe\\nand write him all down, so that when the others return from their work\\nyou can give it to them; then they shall know as we do.”\\n\\nAnd so I have written it whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harker\\nhas written with her typewriter all since she brought the MS. to us.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI\\n\\nDR. SEWARD’S DIARY\\n\\n\\n_29 October._--This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz. Last\\nnight we all assembled a little before the time of sunset. Each of us\\nhad done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and endeavour,\\nand opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and\\nfor our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual time came round Mrs.\\nHarker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer and\\nmore serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually\\nnecessary, she sank into the trance. Usually she speaks on a hint; but\\nthis time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty\\nresolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came:--\\n\\n“I can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only a\\nsteady swirl of water softly running against the hawser. I can hear\\nmen’s voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in\\nthe rowlocks. A gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away.\\nThere is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged\\nalong. What is this? There is a gleam of light; I can feel the air\\nblowing upon me.”\\n\\nHere she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay\\non the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting a\\nweight. Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding.\\nQuincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst\\nHarker’s hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri. There\\nwas a long pause. We all knew that the time when she could speak was\\npassing; but we felt that it was useless to say anything. Suddenly she\\nsat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly:--\\n\\n“Would none of you like a cup of tea? You must all be so tired!” We\\ncould only make her happy, and so acquiesced. She bustled off to get\\ntea; when she had gone Van Helsing said:--\\n\\n“You see, my friends. _He_ is close to land: he has left his\\nearth-chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night he may lie\\nhidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do\\nnot touch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case he can, if it be\\nin the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he did\\nat Whitby. But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he\\nbe carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs men\\nmay discover what the box contain. Thus, in fine, if he escape not on\\nshore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him.\\nWe may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall come\\non him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he dare not be his\\ntrue self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered.”\\n\\nThere was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn;\\nat which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.\\n\\nEarly this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her\\nresponse in her trance. The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming\\nthan before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was\\nso short that we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole\\nsoul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made\\nreply:--\\n\\n“All is dark. I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as\\nof wood on wood.” She paused, and the red sun shot up. We must wait till\\nto-night.\\n\\nAnd so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of\\nexpectation. We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning;\\nbut already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot\\npossibly get in till well after sun-up. Thus we shall have two more\\nhypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker; either or both may possibly throw\\nmore light on what is happening.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later._--Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately it came at a time when\\nthere was no distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at a\\nstation, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation.\\nMrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than\\nthis morning. I am in fear that her power of reading the Count’s\\nsensations may die away, just when we want it most. It seems to me that\\nher imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she has been in the trance\\nhitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts. If this goes\\non it may ultimately mislead us. If I thought that the Count’s power\\nover her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be\\na happy thought; but I am afraid that it may not be so. When she did\\nspeak, her words were enigmatical:--\\n\\n“Something is going out; I can feel it pass me like a cold wind. I can\\nhear, far off, confused sounds--as of men talking in strange tongues,\\nfierce-falling water, and the howling of wolves.” She stopped and a\\nshudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds,\\ntill, at the end, she shook as though in a palsy. She said no more, even\\nin answer to the Professor’s imperative questioning. When she woke from\\nthe trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid; but her mind was\\nall alert. She could not remember anything, but asked what she had said;\\nwhen she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in\\nsilence.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_30 October, 7 a. m._--We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time\\nto write later. Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all.\\nKnowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance,\\nVan Helsing began his passes earlier than usual. They produced no\\neffect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a still\\ngreater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose. The Professor\\nlost no time in his questioning; her answer came with equal quickness:--\\n\\n“All is dark. I hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and the\\ncreaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off. There is another sound, a\\nqueer one like----” She stopped and grew white, and whiter still.\\n\\n“Go on; go on! Speak, I command you!” said Van Helsing in an agonised\\nvoice. At the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen sun\\nwas reddening even Mrs. Harker’s pale face. She opened her eyes, and we\\nall started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost\\nunconcern:--\\n\\n“Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can’t? I don’t remember\\nanything.” Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces, she said,\\nturning from one to the other with a troubled look:--\\n\\n“What have I said? What have I done? I know nothing, only that I was\\nlying here, half asleep, and heard you say ‘go on! speak, I command you!’\\nIt seemed so funny to hear you order me about, as if I were a bad\\nchild!”\\n\\n“Oh, Madam Mina,” he said, sadly, “it is proof, if proof be needed, of\\nhow I love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken more\\nearnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom I\\nam proud to obey!”\\n\\nThe whistles are sounding; we are nearing Galatz. We are on fire with\\nanxiety and eagerness.\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker’s Journal._\\n\\n_30 October._--Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been\\nordered by telegraph, he being the one who could best be spared, since\\nhe does not speak any foreign language. The forces were distributed\\nmuch as they had been at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to the\\nVice-Consul, as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some\\nsort to the official, we being in extreme hurry. Jonathan and the two\\ndoctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival\\nof the _Czarina Catherine_.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later._--Lord Godalming has returned. The Consul is away, and the\\nVice-Consul sick; so the routine work has been attended to by a clerk.\\nHe was very obliging, and offered to do anything in his power.\\n\\n\\n_Jonathan Harker’s Journal._\\n\\n_30 October._--At nine o’clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I called\\non Messrs. Mackenzie & Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm of\\nHapgood. They had received a wire from London, in answer to Lord\\nGodalming’s telegraphed request, asking us to show them any civility in\\ntheir power. They were more than kind and courteous, and took us at once\\non board the _Czarina Catherine_, which lay at anchor out in the river\\nharbour. There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us of his\\nvoyage. He said that in all his life he had never had so favourable a\\nrun.\\n\\n“Man!” he said, “but it made us afeard, for we expeckit that we should\\nhave to pay for it wi’ some rare piece o’ ill luck, so as to keep up the\\naverage. It’s no canny to run frae London to the Black Sea wi’ a wind\\nahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin’ on yer sail for his\\nain purpose. An’ a’ the time we could no speer a thing. Gin we were nigh\\na ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us and travelled wi’ us,\\ntill when after it had lifted and we looked out, the deil a thing could\\nwe see. We ran by Gibraltar wi’oot bein’ able to signal; an’ till we\\ncame to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, we\\nnever were within hail o’ aught. At first I inclined to slack off sail\\nand beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, I thocht that if the\\nDeil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it\\nwhether we would or no. If we had a quick voyage it would be no to our\\nmiscredit wi’ the owners, or no hurt to our traffic; an’ the Old Mon who\\nhad served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no\\nhinderin’ him.” This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition\\nand commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said:--\\n\\n“Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some; and\\nhe know when he meet his match!” The skipper was not displeased with the\\ncompliment, and went on:--\\n\\n“When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o’ them,\\nthe Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had\\nbeen put on board by a queer lookin’ old man just before we had started\\nfrae London. I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa\\nfingers when they saw him, to guard against the evil eye. Man! but the\\nsupersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! I sent them aboot\\ntheir business pretty quick; but as just after a fog closed in on us I\\nfelt a wee bit as they did anent something, though I wouldn’t say it was\\nagin the big box. Well, on we went, and as the fog didn’t let up for\\nfive days I joost let the wind carry us; for if the Deil wanted to get\\nsomewheres--well, he would fetch it up a’reet. An’ if he didn’t, well,\\nwe’d keep a sharp lookout anyhow. Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and\\ndeep water all the time; and two days ago, when the mornin’ sun came\\nthrough the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz.\\nThe Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the\\nbox and fling it in the river. I had to argy wi’ them aboot it wi’ a\\nhandspike; an’ when the last o’ them rose off the deck wi’ his head in\\nhis hand, I had convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye, the\\nproperty and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the\\nriver Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to\\nfling in, and as it was marked Galatz _via_ Varna, I thocht I’d let it\\nlie till we discharged in the port an’ get rid o’t althegither. We\\ndidn’t do much clearin’ that day, an’ had to remain the nicht at anchor;\\nbut in the mornin’, braw an’ airly, an hour before sun-up, a man came\\naboard wi’ an order, written to him from England, to receive a box\\nmarked for one Count Dracula. Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to\\nhis hand. He had his papers a’ reet, an’ glad I was to be rid o’ the\\ndam’ thing, for I was beginnin’ masel’ to feel uneasy at it. If the Deil\\ndid have any luggage aboord the ship, I’m thinkin’ it was nane ither\\nthan that same!”\\n\\n“What was the name of the man who took it?” asked Dr. Van Helsing with\\nrestrained eagerness.\\n\\n“I’ll be tellin’ ye quick!” he answered, and, stepping down to his\\ncabin, produced a receipt signed “Immanuel Hildesheim.” Burgen-strasse\\n16 was the address. We found out that this was all the Captain knew; so\\nwith thanks we came away.\\n\\nWe found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi\\nTheatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez. His arguments were\\npointed with specie--we doing the punctuation--and with a little\\nbargaining he told us what he knew. This turned out to be simple but\\nimportant. He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling\\nhim to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a box\\nwhich would arrive at Galatz in the _Czarina Catherine_. This he was to\\ngive in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovaks\\nwho traded down the river to the port. He had been paid for his work by\\nan English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube\\nInternational Bank. When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to\\nthe ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. That was all\\nhe knew.\\n\\nWe then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him. One of his\\nneighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he had\\ngone away two days before, no one knew whither. This was corroborated by\\nhis landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house\\ntogether with the rent due, in English money. This had been between ten\\nand eleven o’clock last night. We were at a standstill again.\\n\\nWhilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that\\nthe body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of\\nSt. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild\\nanimal. Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the\\nwomen crying out “This is the work of a Slovak!” We hurried away lest we\\nshould have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained.\\n\\nAs we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion. We were all\\nconvinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere; but where\\nthat might be we would have to discover. With heavy hearts we came home\\nto the hotel to Mina.\\n\\nWhen we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Mina\\nagain into our confidence. Things are getting desperate, and it is at\\nleast a chance, though a hazardous one. As a preliminary step, I was\\nreleased from my promise to her.\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker’s Journal._\\n\\n_30 October, evening._--They were so tired and worn out and dispirited\\nthat there was nothing to be done till they had some rest; so I asked\\nthem all to lie down for half an hour whilst I should enter everything\\nup to the moment. I feel so grateful to the man who invented the\\n“Traveller’s” typewriter, and to Mr. Morris for getting this one for\\nme. I should have felt quite astray doing the work if I had to write\\nwith a pen....\\n\\nIt is all done; poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he must have suffered,\\nwhat must he be suffering now. He lies on the sofa hardly seeming to\\nbreathe, and his whole body appears in collapse. His brows are knit; his\\nface is drawn with pain. Poor fellow, maybe he is thinking, and I can\\nsee his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts. Oh!\\nif I could only help at all.... I shall do what I can.\\n\\nI have asked Dr. Van Helsing, and he has got me all the papers that I\\nhave not yet seen.... Whilst they are resting, I shall go over all\\ncarefully, and perhaps I may arrive at some conclusion. I shall try to\\nfollow the Professor’s example, and think without prejudice on the facts\\nbefore me....\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nI do believe that under God’s providence I have made a discovery. I\\nshall get the maps and look over them....\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nI am more than ever sure that I am right. My new conclusion is ready, so\\nI shall get our party together and read it. They can judge it; it is\\nwell to be accurate, and every minute is precious.\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker’s Memorandum._\\n\\n(Entered in her Journal.)\\n\\n_Ground of inquiry._--Count Dracula’s problem is to get back to his own\\nplace.\\n\\n(_a_) He must be _brought back_ by some one. This is evident; for had he\\npower to move himself as he wished he could go either as man, or wolf,\\nor bat, or in some other way. He evidently fears discovery or\\ninterference, in the state of helplessness in which he must be--confined\\nas he is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box.\\n\\n(_b_) _How is he to be taken?_--Here a process of exclusions may help\\nus. By road, by rail, by water?\\n\\n1. _By Road._--There are endless difficulties, especially in leaving the\\ncity.\\n\\n(_x_) There are people; and people are curious, and investigate. A hint,\\na surmise, a doubt as to what might be in the box, would destroy him.\\n\\n(_y_) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers to pass.\\n\\n(_z_) His pursuers might follow. This is his highest fear; and in order\\nto prevent his being betrayed he has repelled, so far as he can, even\\nhis victim--me!\\n\\n2. _By Rail._--There is no one in charge of the box. It would have to\\ntake its chance of being delayed; and delay would be fatal, with enemies\\non the track. True, he might escape at night; but what would he be, if\\nleft in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to? This is not\\nwhat he intends; and he does not mean to risk it.\\n\\n3. _By Water._--Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most\\ndanger in another. On the water he is powerless except at night; even\\nthen he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves. But were\\nhe wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless; and he would\\nindeed be lost. He could have the vessel drive to land; but if it were\\nunfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his position would\\nstill be desperate.\\n\\nWe know from the record that he was on the water; so what we have to do\\nis to ascertain _what_ water.\\n\\nThe first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet; we may,\\nthen, get a light on what his later task is to be.\\n\\n_Firstly._--We must differentiate between what he did in London as part\\nof his general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments and had\\nto arrange as best he could.\\n\\n_Secondly_ we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we\\nknow of, what he has done here.\\n\\nAs to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent\\ninvoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of\\nexit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.\\nThe proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel\\nHildesheim to clear and take away the box _before sunrise_. There is\\nalso the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess at; but\\nthere must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to\\nHildesheim.\\n\\nThat, so far, his plans were successful we know. The _Czarina Catherine_\\nmade a phenomenally quick journey--so much so that Captain Donelson’s\\nsuspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canniness\\nplayed the Count’s game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind\\nthrough fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz. That the\\nCount’s arrangements were well made, has been proved. Hildesheim cleared\\nthe box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky. Skinsky took it--and here\\nwe lose the trail. We only know that the box is somewhere on the water,\\nmoving along. The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been\\navoided.\\n\\nNow we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival--_on\\nland_, at Galatz.\\n\\nThe box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise the Count could\\nappear in his own form. Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to\\naid in the work? In my husband’s diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing\\nwith the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man’s\\nremark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general\\nfeeling against his class. The Count wanted isolation.\\n\\nMy surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to his\\ncastle by water, as the most safe and secret way. He was brought from\\nthe castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks\\nwho took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London.\\nThus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this\\nservice. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he\\ncame out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to\\narranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, and\\nhe knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought,\\nby murdering his agent.\\n\\nI have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the\\nSlovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read in\\nthe typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling\\nlevel with my ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in his box, then,\\nwas on a river in an open boat--propelled probably either by oars or\\npoles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. There\\nwould be no such sound if floating down stream.\\n\\nOf course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may\\npossibly investigate further. Now of these two, the Pruth is the more\\neasily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza\\nwhich runs up round the Borgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifestly as\\nclose to Dracula’s castle as can be got by water.\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker’s Journal--continued._\\n\\nWhen I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me. The\\nothers kept shaking me by both hands, and Dr. Van Helsing said:--\\n\\n“Our dear Madam Mina is once more our teacher. Her eyes have been where\\nwe were blinded. Now we are on the track once again, and this time we\\nmay succeed. Our enemy is at his most helpless; and if we can come on\\nhim by day, on the water, our task will be over. He has a start, but he\\nis powerless to hasten, as he may not leave his box lest those who carry\\nhim may suspect; for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw\\nhim in the stream where he perish. This he knows, and will not. Now men,\\nto our Council of War; for, here and now, we must plan what each and all\\nshall do.”\\n\\n“I shall get a steam launch and follow him,” said Lord Godalming.\\n\\n“And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land,” said Mr.\\nMorris.\\n\\n“Good!” said the Professor, “both good. But neither must go alone. There\\nmust be force to overcome force if need be; the Slovak is strong and\\nrough, and he carries rude arms.” All the men smiled, for amongst them\\nthey carried a small arsenal. Said Mr. Morris:--\\n\\n“I have brought some Winchesters; they are pretty handy in a crowd, and\\nthere may be wolves. The Count, if you remember, took some other\\nprecautions; he made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker could\\nnot quite hear or understand. We must be ready at all points.” Dr.\\nSeward said:--\\n\\n“I think I had better go with Quincey. We have been accustomed to hunt\\ntogether, and we two, well armed, will be a match for whatever may come\\nalong. You must not be alone, Art. It may be necessary to fight the\\nSlovaks, and a chance thrust--for I don’t suppose these fellows carry\\nguns--would undo all our plans. There must be no chances, this time; we\\nshall not rest until the Count’s head and body have been separated, and\\nwe are sure that he cannot re-incarnate.” He looked at Jonathan as he\\nspoke, and Jonathan looked at me. I could see that the poor dear was\\ntorn about in his mind. Of course he wanted to be with me; but then the\\nboat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the ...\\nthe ... the ... Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?) He was\\nsilent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke:--\\n\\n“Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons. First, because you\\nare young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at the\\nlast; and again that it is your right to destroy him--that--which has\\nwrought such woe to you and yours. Be not afraid for Madam Mina; she\\nwill be my care, if I may. I am old. My legs are not so quick to run as\\nonce; and I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or to\\nfight with lethal weapons. But I can be of other service; I can fight in\\nother way. And I can die, if need be, as well as younger men. Now let\\nme say that what I would is this: while you, my Lord Godalming and\\nfriend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, and\\nwhilst John and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be\\nlanded, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy’s\\ncountry. Whilst the old fox is tied in his box, floating on the running\\nstream whence he cannot escape to land--where he dares not raise the lid\\nof his coffin-box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him to\\nperish--we shall go in the track where Jonathan went,--from Bistritz\\nover the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle of Dracula. Here, Madam\\nMina’s hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way--all\\ndark and unknown otherwise--after the first sunrise when we are near\\nthat fateful place. There is much to be done, and other places to be\\nmade sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated.” Here\\nJonathan interrupted him hotly:--\\n\\n“Do you mean to say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina,\\nin her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil’s illness, right\\ninto the jaws of his death-trap? Not for the world! Not for Heaven or\\nHell!” He became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on:--\\n\\n“Do you know what the place is? Have you seen that awful den of hellish\\ninfamy--with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every\\nspeck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo?\\nHave you felt the Vampire’s lips upon your throat?” Here he turned to\\nme, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry:\\n“Oh, my God, what have we done to have this terror upon us!” and he sank\\ndown on the sofa in a collapse of misery. The Professor’s voice, as he\\nspoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed\\nus all:--\\n\\n“Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awful\\nplace that I would go. God forbid that I should take her into that\\nplace. There is work--wild work--to be done there, that her eyes may not\\nsee. We men here, all save Jonathan, have seen with their own eyes what\\nis to be done before that place can be purify. Remember that we are in\\nterrible straits. If the Count escape us this time--and he is strong and\\nsubtle and cunning--he may choose to sleep him for a century, and then\\nin time our dear one”--he took my hand--“would come to him to keep him\\ncompany, and would be as those others that you, Jonathan, saw. You have\\ntold us of their gloating lips; you heard their ribald laugh as they\\nclutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them. You shudder; and\\nwell may it be. Forgive me that I make you so much pain, but it is\\nnecessary. My friend, is it not a dire need for the which I am giving,\\npossibly my life? If it were that any one went into that place to stay,\\nit is I who would have to go to keep them company.”\\n\\n“Do as you will,” said Jonathan, with a sob that shook him all over, “we\\nare in the hands of God!”\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later._--Oh, it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked.\\nHow can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true, and\\nso brave! And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money!\\nWhat can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it do\\nwhen basely used. I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and\\nthat both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing\\nto spend it so freely. For if they did not, our little expedition could\\nnot start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will within\\nanother hour. It is not three hours since it was arranged what part each\\nof us was to do; and now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a lovely steam\\nlaunch, with steam up ready to start at a moment’s notice. Dr. Seward\\nand Mr. Morris have half a dozen good horses, well appointed. We have\\nall the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had. Professor\\nVan Helsing and I are to leave by the 11:40 train to-night for Veresti,\\nwhere we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass. We are\\nbringing a good deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriage and\\nhorses. We shall drive ourselves, for we have no one whom we can trust\\nin the matter. The Professor knows something of a great many languages,\\nso we shall get on all right. We have all got arms, even for me a\\nlarge-bore revolver; Jonathan would not be happy unless I was armed like\\nthe rest. Alas! I cannot carry one arm that the rest do; the scar on my\\nforehead forbids that. Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me by telling me\\nthat I am fully armed as there may be wolves; the weather is getting\\ncolder every hour, and there are snow-flurries which come and go as\\nwarnings.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later._--It took all my courage to say good-bye to my darling. We may\\nnever meet again. Courage, Mina! the Professor is looking at you keenly;\\nhis look is a warning. There must be no tears now--unless it may be that\\nGod will let them fall in gladness.\\n\\n\\n_Jonathan Harker’s Journal._\\n\\n_October 30. Night._--I am writing this in the light from the furnace\\ndoor of the steam launch: Lord Godalming is firing up. He is an\\nexperienced hand at the work, as he has had for years a launch of his\\nown on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads. Regarding our\\nplans, we finally decided that Mina’s guess was correct, and that if any\\nwaterway was chosen for the Count’s escape back to his Castle, the\\nSereth and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the one. We took\\nit, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would be the\\nplace chosen for the crossing the country between the river and the\\nCarpathians. We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at\\nnight; there is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart to\\nmake steaming, even in the dark, easy enough. Lord Godalming tells me to\\nsleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one to be on\\nwatch. But I cannot sleep--how can I with the terrible danger hanging\\nover my darling, and her going out into that awful place.... My only\\ncomfort is that we are in the hands of God. Only for that faith it would\\nbe easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble. Mr.\\nMorris and Dr. Seward were off on their long ride before we started;\\nthey are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher\\nlands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following\\nof its curves. They have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead\\ntheir spare horses--four in all, so as not to excite curiosity. When\\nthey dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves look\\nafter the horses. It may be necessary for us to join forces; if so they\\ncan mount our whole party. One of the saddles has a movable horn, and\\ncan be easily adapted for Mina, if required.\\n\\nIt is a wild adventure we are on. Here, as we are rushing along through\\nthe darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike\\nus; with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes\\nhome. We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways; into\\na whole world of dark and dreadful things. Godalming is shutting the\\nfurnace door....\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_31 October._--Still hurrying along. The day has come, and Godalming is\\nsleeping. I am on watch. The morning is bitterly cold; the furnace heat\\nis grateful, though we have heavy fur coats. As yet we have passed only\\na few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or package of\\nanything like the size of the one we seek. The men were scared every\\ntime we turned our electric lamp on them, and fell on their knees and\\nprayed.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_1 November, evening._--No news all day; we have found nothing of the\\nkind we seek. We have now passed into the Bistritza; and if we are wrong\\nin our surmise our chance is gone. We have over-hauled every boat, big\\nand little. Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat,\\nand treated us accordingly. We saw in this a way of smoothing matters,\\nso at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a\\nRoumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With every boat which we\\nhave over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had every\\ndeference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose\\nto ask or do. Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them,\\ngoing at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board. This\\nwas before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the\\nboat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth. At Fundu\\nwe could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the\\nnight. I am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tell\\nupon me, and nature must have rest some time. Godalming insists that he\\nshall keep the first watch. God bless him for all his goodness to poor\\ndear Mina and me.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_2 November, morning._--It is broad daylight. That good fellow would not\\nwake me. He says it would have been a sin to, for I slept peacefully and\\nwas forgetting my trouble. It seems brutally selfish to me to have slept\\nso long, and let him watch all night; but he was quite right. I am a new\\nman this morning; and, as I sit here and watch him sleeping, I can do\\nall that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, and\\nkeeping watch. I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to\\nme. I wonder where Mina is now, and Van Helsing. They should have got to\\nVeresti about noon on Wednesday. It would take them some time to get the\\ncarriage and horses; so if they had started and travelled hard, they\\nwould be about now at the Borgo Pass. God guide and help them! I am\\nafraid to think what may happen. If we could only go faster! but we\\ncannot; the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost. I wonder how\\nDr. Seward and Mr. Morris are getting on. There seem to be endless\\nstreams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of them\\nare very large--at present, at all events, though they are terrible\\ndoubtless in winter and when the snow melts--the horsemen may not have\\nmet much obstruction. I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see\\nthem; for if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may be\\nnecessary to take counsel together what to do next.\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n_2 November._--Three days on the road. No news, and no time to write it\\nif there had been, for every moment is precious. We have had only the\\nrest needful for the horses; but we are both bearing it wonderfully.\\nThose adventurous days of ours are turning up useful. We must push on;\\nwe shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_3 November._--We heard at Fundu that the launch had gone up the\\nBistritza. I wish it wasn’t so cold. There are signs of snow coming; and\\nif it falls heavy it will stop us. In such case we must get a sledge and\\ngo on, Russian fashion.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_4 November._--To-day we heard of the launch having been detained by an\\naccident when trying to force a way up the rapids. The Slovak boats get\\nup all right, by aid of a rope and steering with knowledge. Some went up\\nonly a few hours before. Godalming is an amateur fitter himself, and\\nevidently it was he who put the launch in trim again. Finally, they got\\nup the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chase\\nafresh. I fear that the boat is not any better for the accident; the\\npeasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again, she kept\\nstopping every now and again so long as she was in sight. We must push\\non harder than ever; our help may be wanted soon.\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker’s Journal._\\n\\n_31 October._--Arrived at Veresti at noon. The Professor tells me that\\nthis morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotise me at all, and that all I\\ncould say was: “dark and quiet.” He is off now buying a carriage and\\nhorses. He says that he will later on try to buy additional horses, so\\nthat we may be able to change them on the way. We have something more\\nthan 70 miles before us. The country is lovely, and most interesting; if\\nonly we were under different conditions, how delightful it would be to\\nsee it all. If Jonathan and I were driving through it alone what a\\npleasure it would be. To stop and see people, and learn something of\\ntheir life, and to fill our minds and memories with all the colour and\\npicturesqueness of the whole wild, beautiful country and the quaint\\npeople! But, alas!--\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_Later._--Dr. Van Helsing has returned. He has got the carriage and\\nhorses; we are to have some dinner, and to start in an hour. The\\nlandlady is putting us up a huge basket of provisions; it seems enough\\nfor a company of soldiers. The Professor encourages her, and whispers to\\nme that it may be a week before we can get any good food again. He has\\nbeen shopping too, and has sent home such a wonderful lot of fur coats\\nand wraps, and all sorts of warm things. There will not be any chance of\\nour being cold.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nWe shall soon be off. I am afraid to think what may happen to us. We are\\ntruly in the hands of God. He alone knows what may be, and I pray Him,\\nwith all the strength of my sad and humble soul, that He will watch over\\nmy beloved husband; that whatever may happen, Jonathan may know that I\\nloved him and honoured him more than I can say, and that my latest and\\ntruest thought will be always for him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVII\\n\\nMINA HARKER’S JOURNAL\\n\\n\\n_1 November._--All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed. The\\nhorses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go\\nwillingly their full stage at best speed. We have now had so many\\nchanges and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to\\nthink that the journey will be an easy one. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic;\\nhe tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well\\nto make the exchange of horses. We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; and\\noff we go. It is a lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginable\\nkinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full\\nof nice qualities. They are _very, very_ superstitious. In the first\\nhouse where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my\\nforehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to\\nkeep off the evil eye. I believe they went to the trouble of putting an\\nextra amount of garlic into our food; and I can’t abide garlic. Ever\\nsince then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have\\nescaped their suspicions. We are travelling fast, and as we have no\\ndriver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but I daresay\\nthat fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way. The\\nProfessor seems tireless; all day he would not take any rest, though he\\nmade me sleep for a long spell. At sunset time he hypnotised me, and he\\nsays that I answered as usual “darkness, lapping water and creaking\\nwood”; so our enemy is still on the river. I am afraid to think of\\nJonathan, but somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself. I write\\nthis whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready. Dr.\\nVan Helsing is sleeping. Poor dear, he looks very tired and old and\\ngrey, but his mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror’s; even in his sleep\\nhe is instinct with resolution. When we have well started I must make\\nhim rest whilst I drive. I shall tell him that we have days before us,\\nand we must not break down when most of all his strength will be\\nneeded.... All is ready; we are off shortly.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_2 November, morning._--I was successful, and we took turns driving all\\nnight; now the day is on us, bright though cold. There is a strange\\nheaviness in the air--I say heaviness for want of a better word; I mean\\nthat it oppresses us both. It is very cold, and only our warm furs keep\\nus comfortable. At dawn Van Helsing hypnotised me; he says I answered\\n“darkness, creaking wood and roaring water,” so the river is changing as\\nthey ascend. I do hope that my darling will not run any chance of\\ndanger--more than need be; but we are in God’s hands.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_2 November, night._--All day long driving. The country gets wilder as\\nwe go, and the great spurs of the Carpathians, which at Veresti seemed\\nso far from us and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round us\\nand tower in front. We both seem in good spirits; I think we make an\\neffort each to cheer the other; in the doing so we cheer ourselves. Dr.\\nVan Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass. The\\nhouses are very few here now, and the Professor says that the last horse\\nwe got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change. He\\ngot two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have a rude\\nfour-in-hand. The dear horses are patient and good, and they give us no\\ntrouble. We are not worried with other travellers, and so even I can\\ndrive. We shall get to the Pass in daylight; we do not want to arrive\\nbefore. So we take it easy, and have each a long rest in turn. Oh, what\\nwill to-morrow bring to us? We go to seek the place where my poor\\ndarling suffered so much. God grant that we may be guided aright, and\\nthat He will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both,\\nand who are in such deadly peril. As for me, I am not worthy in His\\nsight. Alas! I am unclean to His eyes, and shall be until He may deign\\nto let me stand forth in His sight as one of those who have not incurred\\nHis wrath.\\n\\n\\n_Memorandum by Abraham Van Helsing._\\n\\n_4 November._--This to my old and true friend John Seward, M.D., of\\nPurfleet, London, in case I may not see him. It may explain. It is\\nmorning, and I write by a fire which all the night I have kept\\nalive--Madam Mina aiding me. It is cold, cold; so cold that the grey\\nheavy sky is full of snow, which when it falls will settle for all\\nwinter as the ground is hardening to receive it. It seems to have\\naffected Madam Mina; she has been so heavy of head all day that she was\\nnot like herself. She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! She who is usual\\nso alert, have done literally nothing all the day; she even have lost\\nher appetite. She make no entry into her little diary, she who write so\\nfaithful at every pause. Something whisper to me that all is not well.\\nHowever, to-night she is more _vif_. Her long sleep all day have refresh\\nand restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever. At sunset\\nI try to hypnotise her, but alas! with no effect; the power has grown\\nless and less with each day, and to-night it fail me altogether. Well,\\nGod’s will be done--whatever it may be, and whithersoever it may lead!\\n\\nNow to the historical, for as Madam Mina write not in her stenography, I\\nmust, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of us may not go\\nunrecorded.\\n\\nWe got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning. When I\\nsaw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism. We stopped our\\ncarriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance. I made a\\ncouch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, but\\nmore slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep. As\\nbefore, came the answer: “darkness and the swirling of water.” Then she\\nwoke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the Pass.\\nAt this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal; some new\\nguiding power be in her manifested, for she point to a road and say:--\\n\\n“This is the way.”\\n\\n“How know you it?” I ask.\\n\\n“Of course I know it,” she answer, and with a pause, add: “Have not my\\nJonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?”\\n\\nAt first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that there be only one\\nsuch by-road. It is used but little, and very different from the coach\\nroad from the Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more wide and hard, and\\nmore of use.\\n\\nSo we came down this road; when we meet other ways--not always were we\\nsure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow\\nhave fallen--the horses know and they only. I give rein to them, and\\nthey go on so patient. By-and-by we find all the things which Jonathan\\nhave note in that wonderful diary of him. Then we go on for long, long\\nhours and hours. At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep; she try, and\\nshe succeed. She sleep all the time; till at the last, I feel myself to\\nsuspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. But she sleep on, and I may\\nnot wake her though I try. I do not wish to try too hard lest I harm\\nher; for I know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be\\nall-in-all to her. I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feel\\nguilt, as though I have done something; I find myself bolt up, with the\\nreins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. I\\nlook down and find Madam Mina still sleep. It is now not far off sunset\\ntime, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood,\\nso that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep.\\nFor we are going up, and up; and all is oh! so wild and rocky, as though\\nit were the end of the world.\\n\\nThen I arouse Madam Mina. This time she wake with not much trouble, and\\nthen I try to put her to hypnotic sleep. But she sleep not, being as\\nthough I were not. Still I try and try, till all at once I find her and\\nmyself in dark; so I look round, and find that the sun have gone down.\\nMadam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her. She is now quite awake,\\nand look so well as I never saw her since that night at Carfax when we\\nfirst enter the Count’s house. I am amaze, and not at ease then; but she\\nis so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear. I\\nlight a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and she\\nprepare food while I undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter,\\nto feed. Then when I return to the fire she have my supper ready. I go\\nto help her; but she smile, and tell me that she have eat already--that\\nshe was so hungry that she would not wait. I like it not, and I have\\ngrave doubts; but I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it. She\\nhelp me and I eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the\\nfire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch. But presently I forget all\\nof watching; and when I sudden remember that I watch, I find her lying\\nquiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes. Once, twice\\nmore the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning. When I\\nwake I try to hypnotise her; but alas! though she shut her eyes\\nobedient, she may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up; and then\\nsleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake. I have\\nto lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when I have\\nharnessed the horses and made all ready. Madam still sleep, and she look\\nin her sleep more healthy and more redder than before. And I like it\\nnot. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!--I am afraid of all things--even\\nto think but I must go on my way. The stake we play for is life and\\ndeath, or more than these, and we must not flinch.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_5 November, morning._--Let me be accurate in everything, for though you\\nand I have seen some strange things together, you may at the first think\\nthat I, Van Helsing, am mad--that the many horrors and the so long\\nstrain on nerves has at the last turn my brain.\\n\\nAll yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, and\\nmoving into a more and more wild and desert land. There are great,\\nfrowning precipices and much falling water, and Nature seem to have held\\nsometime her carnival. Madam Mina still sleep and sleep; and though I\\ndid have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken her--even for food. I\\nbegan to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as\\nshe is with that Vampire baptism. “Well,” said I to myself, “if it be\\nthat she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep at\\nnight.” As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient and\\nimperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept. Again I waked\\nwith a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam Mina still\\nsleeping, and the sun low down. But all was indeed changed; the frowning\\nmountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a\\nsteep-rising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell\\nof in his diary. At once I exulted and feared; for now, for good or ill,\\nthe end was near.\\n\\nI woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotise her; but alas!\\nunavailing till too late. Then, ere the great dark came upon us--for\\neven after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and\\nall was for a time in a great twilight--I took out the horses and fed\\nthem in what shelter I could. Then I make a fire; and near it I make\\nMadam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid\\nher rugs. I got ready food: but she would not eat, simply saying that\\nshe had not hunger. I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness. But\\nI myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all. Then, with the\\nfear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, round\\nwhere Madam Mina sat; and over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and\\nI broke it fine so that all was well guarded. She sat still all the\\ntime--so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the\\nsnow was not more pale; and no word she said. But when I drew near, she\\nclung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head to\\nfeet with a tremor that was pain to feel. I said to her presently, when\\nshe had grown more quiet:--\\n\\n“Will you not come over to the fire?” for I wished to make a test of\\nwhat she could. She rose obedient, but when she have made a step she\\nstopped, and stood as one stricken.\\n\\n“Why not go on?” I asked. She shook her head, and, coming back, sat\\ndown in her place. Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one waked\\nfrom sleep, she said simply:--\\n\\n“I cannot!” and remained silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that what she\\ncould not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there might be\\ndanger to her body, yet her soul was safe!\\n\\nPresently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I\\ncame to them and quieted them. When they did feel my hands on them, they\\nwhinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a\\ntime. Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive to\\nthe cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming was\\nwith quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I was\\nabout stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying\\nsweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the dark there was a light of\\nsome kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the\\nsnow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with\\ntrailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses\\nwhinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began to\\nfear--horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in that\\nring wherein I stood. I began, too, to think that my imaginings were of\\nthe night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, and\\nall the terrible anxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan’s\\nhorrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist\\nbegan to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy\\nglimpse of those women that would have kissed him. And then the horses\\ncowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. Even\\nthe madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. I\\nfeared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and\\ncircled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; when\\nI would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held\\nme back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low\\nit was:--\\n\\n“No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!” I turned to her, and\\nlooking in her eyes, said:--\\n\\n“But you? It is for you that I fear!” whereat she laughed--a laugh, low\\nand unreal, and said:--\\n\\n“Fear for _me_! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from them\\nthan I am,” and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of\\nwind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead.\\nThen, alas! I knew. Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the\\nwheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without\\nthe Holy circle. Then they began to materialise till--if God have not\\ntake away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes--there were before me\\nin actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when\\nthey would have kissed his throat. I knew the swaying round forms, the\\nbright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous\\nlips. They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina; and as their laugh came\\nthrough the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to\\nher, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were\\nof the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:--\\n\\n“Come, sister. Come to us. Come! Come!” In fear I turned to my poor\\nMadam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh! the\\nterror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my\\nheart that was all of hope. God be thanked she was not, yet, of them. I\\nseized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the\\nWafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, and\\nlaughed their low horrid laugh. I fed the fire, and feared them not; for\\nI knew that we were safe within our protections. They could not\\napproach, me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained within\\nthe ring, which she could not leave no more than they could enter. The\\nhorses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell on\\nthem softly, and they grew whiter. I knew that there was for the poor\\nbeasts no more of terror.\\n\\nAnd so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the\\nsnow-gloom. I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror; but\\nwhen that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again.\\nAt the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the\\nwhirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away\\ntowards the castle, and were lost.\\n\\nInstinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina, intending\\nto hypnotise her; but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep, from which I\\ncould not wake her. I tried to hypnotise through her sleep, but she made\\nno response, none at all; and the day broke. I fear yet to stir. I have\\nmade my fire and have seen the horses, they are all dead. To-day I have\\nmuch to do here, and I keep waiting till the sun is up high; for there\\nmay be places where I must go, where that sunlight, though snow and mist\\nobscure it, will be to me a safety.\\n\\nI will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will to my terrible\\nwork. Madam Mina still sleeps; and, God be thanked! she is calm in her\\nsleep....\\n\\n\\n_Jonathan Harker’s Journal._\\n\\n_4 November, evening._--The accident to the launch has been a terrible\\nthing for us. Only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago;\\nand by now my dear Mina would have been free. I fear to think of her,\\noff on the wolds near that horrid place. We have got horses, and we\\nfollow on the track. I note this whilst Godalming is getting ready. We\\nhave our arms. The Szgany must look out if they mean fight. Oh, if only\\nMorris and Seward were with us. We must only hope! If I write no more\\nGood-bye, Mina! God bless and keep you.\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\\n\\n_5 November._--With the dawn we saw the body of Szgany before us dashing\\naway from the river with their leiter-wagon. They surrounded it in a\\ncluster, and hurried along as though beset. The snow is falling lightly\\nand there is a strange excitement in the air. It may be our own\\nfeelings, but the depression is strange. Far off I hear the howling of\\nwolves; the snow brings them down from the mountains, and there are\\ndangers to all of us, and from all sides. The horses are nearly ready,\\nand we are soon off. We ride to death of some one. God alone knows who,\\nor where, or what, or when, or how it may be....\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Van Helsing’s Memorandum._\\n\\n_5 November, afternoon._--I am at least sane. Thank God for that mercy\\nat all events, though the proving it has been dreadful. When I left\\nMadam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to the castle.\\nThe blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti was\\nuseful; though the doors were all open I broke them off the rusty\\nhinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so that\\nbeing entered I might not get out. Jonathan’s bitter experience served\\nme here. By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for I\\nknew that here my work lay. The air was oppressive; it seemed as if\\nthere was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy. Either\\nthere was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves.\\nThen I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was in terrible plight.\\nThe dilemma had me between his horns.\\n\\nHer, I had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from the\\nVampire in that Holy circle; and yet even there would be the wolf! I\\nresolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must\\nsubmit, if it were God’s will. At any rate it was only death and\\nfreedom beyond. So did I choose for her. Had it but been for myself the\\nchoice had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than\\nthe grave of the Vampire! So I make my choice to go on with my work.\\n\\nI knew that there were at least three graves to find--graves that are\\ninhabit; so I search, and search, and I find one of them. She lay in her\\nVampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as\\nthough I have come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that in old time, when\\nsuch things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine,\\nfound at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve. So he delay,\\nand delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of the\\nwanton Un-Dead have hypnotise him; and he remain on and on, till sunset\\ncome, and the Vampire sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of the fair\\nwoman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to a\\nkiss--and man is weak. And there remain one more victim in the Vampire\\nfold; one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Un-Dead!...\\n\\nThere is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence\\nof such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and\\nheavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour such\\nas the lairs of the Count have had. Yes, I was moved--I, Van Helsing,\\nwith all my purpose and with my motive for hate--I was moved to a\\nyearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog my\\nvery soul. It may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the\\nstrange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. Certain it\\nwas that I was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yields\\nto a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air a\\nlong, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound\\nof a clarion. For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard.\\n\\nThen I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching\\naway tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one. I dared not\\npause to look on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I should\\nbegin to be enthrall; but I go on searching until, presently, I find in\\na high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister\\nwhich, like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of\\nthe mist. She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so\\nexquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls\\nsome of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl\\nwith new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul-wail of my dear Madam\\nMina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could be wrought\\nfurther upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work. By this time I had\\nsearched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell; and as\\nthere had been only three of these Un-Dead phantoms around us in the\\nnight, I took it that there were no more of active Un-Dead existent.\\nThere was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest; huge it was, and\\nnobly proportioned. On it was but one word\\n\\n                                DRACULA.\\n\\nThis then was the Un-Dead home of the King-Vampire, to whom so many more\\nwere due. Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what I knew.\\nBefore I began to restore these women to their dead selves through my\\nawful work, I laid in Dracula’s tomb some of the Wafer, and so banished\\nhim from it, Un-Dead, for ever.\\n\\nThen began my terrible task, and I dreaded it. Had it been but one, it\\nhad been easy, comparative. But three! To begin twice more after I had\\nbeen through a deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the sweet\\nMiss Lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived\\nthrough centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of the\\nyears; who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives....\\n\\nOh, my friend John, but it was butcher work; had I not been nerved by\\nthoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of\\nfear, I could not have gone on. I tremble and tremble even yet, though\\ntill all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seen\\nthe repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it just\\nere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had been\\nwon, I could not have gone further with my butchery. I could not have\\nendured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of\\nwrithing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have fled in terror and\\nleft my work undone. But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity them\\nnow and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of death\\nfor a short moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly had my knife\\nsevered the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and\\ncrumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have come\\ncenturies agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud “I\\nam here!”\\n\\nBefore I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more can\\nthe Count enter there Un-Dead.\\n\\nWhen I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she woke from her\\nsleep, and, seeing, me, cried out in pain that I had endured too much.\\n\\n“Come!” she said, “come away from this awful place! Let us go to meet my\\nhusband who is, I know, coming towards us.” She was looking thin and\\npale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour. I was\\nglad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of the\\nfresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep.\\n\\nAnd so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meet\\nour friends--and _him_--whom Madam Mina tell me that she _know_ are\\ncoming to meet us.\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker’s Journal._\\n\\n_6 November._--It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I\\ntook our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We did\\nnot go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take\\nheavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being\\nleft without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some of our\\nprovisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as we\\ncould see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of\\nhabitation. When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavy\\nwalking and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where the\\nclear line of Dracula’s castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under\\nthe hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the\\nCarpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur,\\nperched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with\\nseemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain\\non any side. There was something wild and uncanny about the place. We\\ncould hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but the\\nsound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was\\nfull of terror. I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching about\\nthat he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less\\nexposed in case of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards; we\\ncould trace it through the drifted snow.\\n\\nIn a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined\\nhim. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock,\\nwith an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by the\\nhand and drew me in: “See!” he said, “here you will be in shelter; and\\nif the wolves do come I can meet them one by one.” He brought in our\\nfurs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and\\nforced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so was\\nrepulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I could\\nnot bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not\\nreproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the top\\nof the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out:--\\n\\n“Look! Madam Mina, look! look!” I sprang up and stood beside him on the\\nrock; he handed me his glasses and pointed. The snow was now falling\\nmore heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning\\nto blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the\\nsnow flurries and I could see a long way round. From the height where we\\nwere it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the\\nwhite waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in\\nkinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not far\\noff--in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before--came a\\ngroup of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, a\\nlong leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog’s tail\\nwagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the\\nsnow as they were, I could see from the men’s clothes that they were\\npeasants or gypsies of some kind.\\n\\nOn the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for I\\nfelt that the end was coming. The evening was now drawing close, and\\nwell I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned\\nthere, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all\\npursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation,\\nhowever, he was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Round\\nthe rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last\\nnight. When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying:--\\n\\n“At least you shall be safe here from _him_!” He took the glasses from\\nme, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us.\\n“See,” he said, “they come quickly; they are flogging the horses, and\\ngalloping as hard as they can.” He paused and went on in a hollow\\nvoice:--\\n\\n“They are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God’s will be\\ndone!” Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole\\nlandscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however, and once more his\\nglasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry:--\\n\\n“Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the\\nsouth. It must be Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look before the snow\\nblots it all out!” I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr. Seward\\nand Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan.\\nAt the same time I _knew_ that Jonathan was not far off; looking around\\nI saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at\\nbreak-neck speed. One of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took,\\nof course, to be Lord Godalming. They, too, were pursuing the party with\\nthe cart. When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy,\\nand, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he\\nlaid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the\\nopening of our shelter. “They are all converging,” he said. “When the\\ntime comes we shall have gypsies on all sides.” I got out my revolver\\nready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came\\nlouder and closer. When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again.\\nIt was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us,\\nand beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down\\ntowards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I could\\nsee here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger\\nnumbers--the wolves were gathering for their prey.\\n\\nEvery instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now in\\nfierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in\\ncircling eddies. At times we could not see an arm’s length before us;\\nbut at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to\\nclear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We had of\\nlate been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew\\nwith fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the\\nsun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less\\nthan an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various\\nbodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer\\nand more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly\\nhad driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts,\\nthe snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each\\nparty, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did\\nnot seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they\\nseemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower\\nand lower on the mountain tops.\\n\\nCloser and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behind\\nour rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determined\\nthat they should not pass. One and all were quite unaware of our\\npresence.\\n\\nAll at once two voices shouted out to: “Halt!” One was my Jonathan’s,\\nraised in a high key of passion; the other Mr. Morris’ strong resolute\\ntone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have known the language, but\\nthere was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were\\nspoken. Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming\\nand Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the\\nother. The leader of the gypsies, a splendid-looking fellow who sat his\\nhorse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to his\\ncompanions some word to proceed. They lashed the horses which sprang\\nforward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in an\\nunmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van\\nHelsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them.\\nSeeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew\\nup. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the\\ngypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and held\\nhimself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant.\\n\\nThe leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in\\nfront, and pointing first to the sun--now close down on the hill\\ntops--and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand.\\nFor answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses\\nand dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seeing\\nJonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been\\nupon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild,\\nsurging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of our\\nparties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantly\\nformed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one\\nshouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the\\norder.\\n\\nIn the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring\\nof men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it was\\nevident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun\\nshould set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the\\nlevelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor\\nthe howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their\\nattention. Jonathan’s impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his\\npurpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they\\ncowered, aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon the\\ncart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great\\nbox, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr.\\nMorris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of\\nSzgany. All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had,\\nwith the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had\\nseen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and\\nthey cut at him. He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first\\nI thought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprang\\nbeside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that\\nwith his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was\\nspurting through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, for\\nas Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest,\\nattempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked\\nthe other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men the\\nlid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and\\nthe top of the box was thrown back.\\n\\nBy this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters,\\nand at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and made\\nno resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the\\nshadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the Count\\nlying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from\\nthe cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxen\\nimage, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I\\nknew too well.\\n\\nAs I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them\\nturned to triumph.\\n\\nBut, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan’s great knife.\\nI shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the same\\nmoment Mr. Morris’s bowie knife plunged into the heart.\\n\\nIt was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the\\ndrawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from\\nour sight.\\n\\nI shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final\\ndissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never\\ncould have imagined might have rested there.\\n\\nThe Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone\\nof its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the\\nsetting sun.\\n\\nThe gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary\\ndisappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away as\\nif for their lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon the\\nleiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves,\\nwhich had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving\\nus alone.\\n\\nMr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his\\nhand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. I\\nflew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the\\ntwo doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his\\nhead on his shoulder. With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my hand\\nin that of his own which was unstained. He must have seen the anguish of\\nmy heart in my face, for he smiled at me and said:--\\n\\n“I am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!” he cried\\nsuddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, “It was\\nworth for this to die! Look! look!”\\n\\nThe sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams\\nfell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light. With one impulse\\nthe men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest “Amen” broke from all\\nas their eyes followed the pointing of his finger. The dying man\\nspoke:--\\n\\n“Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain! See! the snow is not\\nmore stainless than her forehead! The curse has passed away!”\\n\\nAnd, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a\\ngallant gentleman.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  NOTE\\n\\n\\nSeven years ago we all went through the flames; and the happiness of\\nsome of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured. It\\nis an added joy to Mina and to me that our boy’s birthday is the same\\nday as that on which Quincey Morris died. His mother holds, I know, the\\nsecret belief that some of our brave friend’s spirit has passed into\\nhim. His bundle of names links all our little band of men together; but\\nwe call him Quincey.\\n\\nIn the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and went\\nover the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid and\\nterrible memories. It was almost impossible to believe that the things\\nwhich we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were\\nliving truths. Every trace of all that had been was blotted out. The\\ncastle stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation.\\n\\nWhen we got home we were talking of the old time--which we could all\\nlook back on without despair, for Godalming and Seward are both happily\\nmarried. I took the papers from the safe where they had been ever since\\nour return so long ago. We were struck with the fact, that in all the\\nmass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly one\\nauthentic document; nothing but a mass of typewriting, except the later\\nnote-books of Mina and Seward and myself, and Van Helsing’s memorandum.\\nWe could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept these as\\nproofs of so wild a story. Van Helsing summed it all up as he said, with\\nour boy on his knee:--\\n\\n“We want no proofs; we ask none to believe us! This boy will some day\\nknow what a brave and gallant woman his mother is. Already he knows her\\nsweetness and loving care; later on he will understand how some men so\\nloved her, that they did dare much for her sake.”\\n\\nJONATHAN HARKER.\\n\\n                                THE END\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n                       _There’s More to Follow!_\\n\\n     More stories of the sort you like; more, probably, by the author of\\n     this one; more than 500 titles all told by writers of world-wide\\n     reputation, in the Authors’ Alphabetical List which you will find\\n     on the _reverse side_ of the wrapper of this book.

INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\\ntrademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\\nproviding copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in\\naccordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the\\nproduction, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™\\nelectronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,\\nincluding legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of\\nthe following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this\\nor any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or\\nadditions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any\\nDefect you cause.\\n\\nSection 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\nwww.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact.\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without\\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\"}\n",
